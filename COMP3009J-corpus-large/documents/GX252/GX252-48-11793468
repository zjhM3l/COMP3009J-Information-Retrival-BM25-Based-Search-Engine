CHAPTER I INTRODUCTION : BACKGROUND AND OVERVIEW OF THE ASSISTED LIVING LITERATURE REVIEW UPDATE
"Assisted living" is a term that generally refers to a type of care that combines housing and supportive services in a "homelike" environment and that strives to maximize the individual functionin g and autonomy of residents.
This document provides a review of published an d unpublished literature on assisted living for the period 1992 through September, 1995.
Thi s literature review serves as an update to a review of the literature conducted for the Office of the Assi stant Secretary for Planning and Evaluation (ASPE) in 1992.
Like its predecessor, thi s review focuses on assisted living for the frail elderly.
This chapter provides a summary of the 1992 Policy Synthesis l iterature review, including the origin of the literature review and a discussion of the policy concerns that make assiste d living for the frail elderly an increasingly important issue.
A description of how the review update has been conducted, what it has yielded in numbers of arti cles and content, and how it has been organized are also provided in this chapter.

LITERATURE REVIEW
FOR THE
1992 POLICY SYNTHESIS
IN
BRIEF
In 1992, Lewin-VHI conducted a Policy Synthesis on Assisted Living For the Frail Elderly for the Office of the Assistant Secretary for Planning and Evaluation (ASPE), hereafter referred to as the 1992 Policy Synthesis.
The 1992 Policy Synthesis was undertaken because of policy concerns generated by a growing frail elderly population, a rapid increase in costs of delivering long-term care to that population, and growing in terest in various types of supportive housing for the elderly as a potentially desirable arrangement for both housing and service delivery.
Between 1990 and 2030, the U.S. elderly population is expected to double to a total of 65 million people, an estimated 7.3 million of whom will be frail elderly.
Costs of nursing home care for the elderly, both in public and out-of-pocket costs, are estimated to grow to more than $100 million annually by 2020.
The special combination of housing and supportive services that characterize assisted living is identified with greater independence and dignity for the frail elderly and is bringi ng the fledgling assisted living industry national attention.
Because of its uniqu e physical and philosophical characteristics, assisted living may be a preferred living option for the frail elderly and, at least for some - - a less expensive alternative to nursing homes.
The 1992 Policy Synthesis was based on a review and analysis of over 350 books , reports, documents (both published and unpublished), and telephone interviews with relate d association representatives, policymakers, academics, and researchers.
The 350 items in the 1992 bibliography span 15 years and include materia l on a wide range of housing options for the frail elderly.
At the time that the original report was written, there were relatively few articles and reports available specifically concerning assisted living.
One result of the rapid evolution of the assisted living industry has been the voluminous increase in the number of articles and books published specifical ly on the topic in the years since the policy synthesis was produced.
This literature review update identified 175 articles an d reports related to assisted living.
Although most of the 1992 literature was indirectly related to assisted living, most of literature included in this update is directly related to assisted living.

THE
LITERATURE REVIEW UPDATE Lewin-VHI, Inc.

1-1
To conduct this literature review update, we began with an automated search of seven databases: 1) AgeLine; 2) EM Base; 3) Health Periodicals; 4) Health Plan Administration; 5 ) Medline; 6) Psychinfo; and 7) the Trade and Industry Index.
Key words used for the database searches were: assisted living, congregate housing, board an d care home, and domiciliary care.
Additional automated searches were conducted by specifying the names of publications that are known to feature articles on assisted living (e.g., Provider , Spectrum , and Contemporary LongTerm Care).
In addition, studies mentioned in that literature and reference lists from article s identified in the computer searches were used to identify additional sources.
Finally, we asked members of our Technical Advisory Panel to help us identify articles and reports.
C.
FINDINGS
OF THE
LITERATURE REVIEW UPDATE: A LITERATURE SOURCE ANALYSIS
We identified 175 articles and reports published or issued between January, 1992 and September, 1995.
To assess recent trends in the literature, we classified the articles into nine categories, based on the source of the article: newspaper articles, provider trade publications, other tr ade publications, empirical research in peer-reviewed journals, consumer oriente d publications, newsletters related to health and/or housing, public relations releases, busines s journals, and other sources (see Exhibit 1.1).
Growing interest in assisted living is illustrated by an acc elerating rate of publication.
We identified 108 articles and reports in the three year s from January 1992, to January 1995; but we found 67 a rticles and reports published or issued in just the first nine months of 1995.
Th e majority of articles (32 percent) identified since 1992 were found in provider trade publications.
The second largest category of articles is "Other Sources."
This category includes reports (not yet submi tted for publication in peer-reviewed journals) by consultants and researc h organizations that typically perform "leading edge" work.
The third largest category is "Othe r Trade Publications" (e.g., The Consultant Pharmacist ) (15 percent).
"Empirical Research i n Peer-Reviewed Journals" makes up the fourth largest category (10 percent).

Note: Individual line percentages do not equal 100 percent due to rounding.
Closer examination of the literature in the provider trade publication category, the largest of the nine categories, indicates that these articles are concerned largely with financing and the future of the industry.
Fourteen of the provider trade publication articles focus on financing, another si x articles review the benefits of Medicaid waivers and third-party reimbursement, six more articles are concerne d with regulations, and five articles explore the future of the industry, particularl y considering the growing influence of managed care.
Articles drawn from the empirical literature provide some of the most valuable information of all of the sources.
The empirical literature includes various reports on the assisted living industry in general and two studies of health care utilization among those living in Continuing Car e Retiremen t Communities (CCRCs) or assisted living facilities (Newcomer 
Articles included in the category "other trade publications" (i.e., from other than assisted living provider trade publications) are oriented to the insurance, architecture, and real estate industries.
The insurance industry is concerned with long-term care insurance coverage of assisted living (Koco, 1992; Koco, 1994) and the real estate industry finds value in assisted living facilities as investment opportunities (Kramer, 1994, Real Estate Weekly, 1994).
D.
CONCLUSION
The update review of the literature published since 1992 indicates a heightened interest in assis ted living.
In general, the articles written over the past two to three years have becom e increasingly more specific and more exhaustive of the subject of assisted living.
Opportunities for HUD Section 232 financing and Medicaid waivers have inspired many of the recent articles an d reports.
In addition, research on the needs of dementia patients and "best practices" research on living arrangements for the frail elderly in general have also had an impact on recent writing o n assisted living.
However, a general consensus in the literature regarding definitions of assisted living 95SW00026

ORGANIZATION
OF THE LITERATURE
REVIEW UPDATE
With one exception, the chapter headings and topics used in the 1992 Policy Synthesi s provide a structure for the literature review update.
The exception is the chapter on the frail elderly and their li ving arrangements, which has been omitted from the update.
Each chapter in th e followin g report includes a brief summary of findings from the 1992 Policy Synthesis followed b y analyses of more recent articles.
Chapter Two provides an the term assisted living from the on the issues involved in defining relevant for establishing a formal overview of assisted living.
This chapter follows the evolution of time of the 1992 Policy Synthesis to the present.
It also focuses the term assisted living, and the kinds of boundaries that may be definition.
Chapter Three addresses the issues of people, settings, and services.
Both assisted living residents and staff are mentioned frequently in the literature covered in this chapter.
In addition, we discuss the importance of environment and physical structure to the concept of assisted living.
We also explore whether there is a minimum set of core services for assisted living facilities, and th e extent to which these are scheduled versus non-scheduled services.
The degree to which skilled nursing and ancillary services are provided is another topic of importance.
Finally, the literatur e coverage of initial needs assessments and reevaluations is discussed.
Chapter Four addresses the issues of the effectiveness and costs of assisted living .
Advocate s of assisted living have maintained that assisted living facilities are a less expensiv e alternative to nursing homes.
Empirical studies support the notion that assisted living may contribute to a different way of utilizing the health care system.
This chapter also discusses different models of pricing assisted living that have developed over time, as well as the actual costs to the consumer that have been reported in the literature.
Chapter Five addresses issues involved in regulating assisted living.
We focus on th e contentious question of the need for industry regulation (with some attention given to the ability of the industry to self-regulate through a formalized accreditation process) and we review recent state regulatory changes.
Recent changes in Certificate of Need (CON) regulations and the introduction of Medicaid waiver programs are both important topics addressed in this chapter.
Chapter Six addresses the issue of financing assisted living.
Both new public initiatives and public/private initiatives are discussed in this chapter.
In particular, the implications of the HU D Section 232 Mortgage Insurance Program and other new changes in i nstitutional lending for assisted living facilities are reviewed.

AN OVERVIEW
OF
CHAPTER II ASSISTED LIVING: WHAT IS ASSISTED LIVING?
In this c hapter we provide an overview of assisted living.
We discuss the conventiona l definition(s) of the term "assisted living" prior to the 1992 Policy Synthesis and the evolution of the term since that time.
This chapter also addresses the fundamental problems in reaching a common understanding of the physical and philosophical characteristics of assisted living as well a s developing profiles of assisted living residents and staff.
A.
DEFINITIONS OF ASSISTED LIVING AT T
HE
T
IME OF THE
1992 POLICY SYNTHESIS
The 1992 Policy Synthesis found that the term "assisted living" was broadly used to refer to housing for the elderly with supportive services in a homelike environment.
No precise definition of assisted living had developed at the time of the 1992 Policy S ynthesis.
In addition, other terms used to describe similar packages of services (e.g. , board and care and residential care) were often used interchangeably with assisted living.
At the time the 1992 Policy Synthesis was completed, federal regulations generally included assisted living facilities under the term "board and care."
Most states did not use the term "assisted living" except in reference to programs for persons with menta l retardation and related conditions.
Althou gh the 1992 Policy Synthesis determined that the definition of assisted living wa s similar to that of board and care, the proponents of assis ted living at the time asserted that a special philosophy distinguished assisted living from board and care.
That philosophy was said to embody a set of principles regarding such things as maximizing the functional capability and the autonomy of the indivi dual resident.
These principles included using the environment as an aid to bot h independence and socialization.
By 1992, two views of the role of assisted living in long-term care had emerged.
Som e viewed assi sted living as a type of service on a "continuum" from home care to skilled nursin g faciliti es (SNFs).
Others, those who advocate for "aging in place," saw assisted living as a n approach and philosophy of care and living that could serve the needs of a very broad range o f people (including those needing skilled nursing).

CURRENT DEFINITIONS 1.
OF
ASSISTED LIVING
Trade Association and Organization Definitions
In the past three years, several trade associations affiliated with the assisted living industry and a number of research and policy organizations have developed formal definitions of assiste d living.
Exhibit 2.1 presents the formal definitions of the Assisted Living Facilities Association o f America (ALFAA), the American Seniors Housing Association (ASHA), the American Association of Homes and Services for the Aging (AAHSA), the American Association of Retired Persons (AARP), the Health Care Financing Administration (HCFA), the U.S. Department of Housing and Urba n Development (HUD), the National Academy of State Health Policy, National Association o f Residential Care Facilities, and the National Association of State Units on Aging (NASUA).

Definition "Assist ed living is a program that provides and/or arranges for the provision of dail y meals, personal and other supportive services, health care, and 24 hour oversight t o persons residing in a group residential facility who need assistance with activities of daily living and instrumental activities of daily living.
It is characterized by a philosophy o f service provision that is consumer driven, flexible, individualized and maximize s consumer independence, choice, privacy, and dignity."
"Assisted living is a special combination of housing, supportive services, personalized assistance and health care designed to respond to the individual needs of those who need help in activities of daily living.
Supportive services are available, 24 hours a day, to meet sc heduled and unscheduled needs, in a way that promotes maximu m independence and dignity for each resident and encourages the involvement of a resident's family, neighbors, and friends."
"A coord inated array of personal care, health services, and other supportive service s available 2 4 hours per day, to residents who have been assessed to need thos e services.
Assisted living promotes resident self direction and participation in decisions that emphasize independence, individuality, privacy, dignity, and residentia l surroundings."
Th e following operational definition was used for the AARP's 1995 publication title d "Assisted Living and Its Implications for Long-Term Care" by Elizabeth Clemmer: "group or congregate living arrangem ents that provide room and board as well as social and recreational opportunities; assistance to residents who need help with personal needs and medications; availability of protective oversight or monitoring; and help around the clock and on an unscheduled basis."

OF
ASSISTED LIVING
Definition Assisted living is one of two categories of Adult R esidential Care under a 1915(c) waiver.
It is defined as: Personal care and services, homemaker, chore, attendant care, companion services, medication oversight (to the extent permitted under State law), therapeutic social and recreational programming, provided in a licensed community care facility, in conjunction with residing in the f acility.
This service includes 24 hour on site response staff to meet schedul ed or unpredictable needs and to provide supervision of safety and security .
Other individuals or agencies may also furnish care directly, or under arrangement with the community care facility, but the care provided by these other entities supplements that provided by the community care facility and does not supplant it.
Care is furnished to individuals who reside in their own living units (which may include dually occupied units when both occupants consent to the arrangement) which may or may not include kitchenette and/or living rooms as well as bedrooms.
Living units may be locke d at the discretion of the client except when a physician or mental healt profession al has certified in writing the client is sufficiently cognitively impaired as to be a danger to self or others if given the opportunity to lock the door.
(This requiremen does not apply where it conflicts with the fire code.)
Each living unit is separate an distinct fro m each other.
The facility must have a central dining room, living room o parlor, and common activity center(s) (which may also serve as living rooms or dining rooms).
Ro utines of care provision and service delivery must be client-driven to th maximum extent possible.
Assisted living services may also include: home health care physical therapy occupational therapy speech therapy medication administration intermittent skilled nursing services transportation specified in the plan of care However, nurs ing and skilled therapy services are incidental, rather than integral to the provi sion of assisted living services.
Payment will not be made for 24-hour skille d nursing care or supervision.
FFP is not available in the cost of room and boar d furnished in conjunction with residing in an assisted living facility.
Payments for adult r esidential care services are not made for room and board, items of comfort or convenience, or the costs of facility maintenance, upkeep, and improvement.
Payment for adult residentia l care services does not include payments made, directly or indirectly, to members of the recipient's immediate family.
Assisted living means a public facility, proprietary facility, or facility of a private nonprofit corporation that is used for the care of the frail elderly, and that: 1.
Is licensed and regulated by the state if there is no state law providing for suc h licensing and regulation by the state, by the municipality or other political subdivision in which the facility is located; 2.
Makes available to residents supportive services to assist the residents in carrying out activities of daily living...

OF
ASSISTED LIVING
Definition NASHP declined to provide one concise definitio n of assisted living.
However, extensive commen tary on all aspects of services, admission and discharge criteria, and sit e standards make the "Guide to Assisted Living and State Policy" a definition in itself.
Residential care facility means a home or facility of any size, operated for profit or notfo r-profit, which undertakes through its owner/s or management to provide food , housing and s upport with activities of daily living and/or protective care for two or more adult residents not related to the owner or administrator.
Residential care homes are also known as assisted living facilities, foster homes, board and care homes, sheltered care homes, etc.
NASUA subscribes to a definition of assisted l iving which acknowledges the deep desire of Americ a's elders to reside in their own homes or in a homelike environment .
Accordingly, the Associatio n views assisted living as referring to a homelike congregate res idence providing individual living units where appropriate supportive services ar e provi ded through individualized service plans.
Assisted living is first and foremost a home in which residents' independence and individuality are supported and in whic h their privacy and right to self-expression are respected.
National Association of State Units on Aging (NASUA)
Most of the definitions from the nine organizations listed above refer to the "aging-in-place" philosophy of assisted living.
The central tenet of that philosophy, the notion that the resident' s dignity and autonomy are paramount, is made clear in most of these definitions.
For example, the AARP definition emphasizes that the "aim of assisted living is to enhance the capabilities of frai l older person s so that they can live as independently as possible in a home-like atmosphere .
Assisted living accomplishes this through both building design and care practices that facilitat e independent functioning and reinforce residents' autonomy, dignity, privacy, and right to mak e choices" (Clemmer, 1993).
The definitions from AAHSA, AARP, ALFAA, ASHA, and HCFA all specify that supportiv e services should be available 24-hours a day.
The 24-hour requirement is significant because i t indicates a facility's commitment to respond to unscheduled needs for assistance.
In contrast, the National Association of Residential Care Facilities and HUD definitions do not mention any tenets of the assisted living philosophy nor do they specify when supportive services should be available.
2.
Assisted Living/Seniors Housing Experts Definitions
Experts in the assisted living field increasingly include mention of a special assisted living philosophy in their working definitions (see Exhibit 2.2).
Tangible evidence and results of thi s philosophy (e.g., "the dignity of risk" or "individual choice") are very difficult to quantify in surve y research.
In recognition of this, Kane and Wilson, two of the researchers most identified with the idea that assisted living includes a special philosophy of care, used a minimalist definition in their 1993 study for AARP.

"One attractive emerging option is assisted living, which under some state licensur e features single-occupancy apartment units with full bathrooms and kitchenettes.
Such programs serve three meals a day and provide on-site staff.
Individually planned care is brought to the consumers' own apartments."
"Assisted living is any group re sidential program that is not licensed as a nursing home, that provides perso nal care to persons with need for assistance in the activities of daily living (ADL), and that can respond to unscheduled n eed for assistance that might arise."
"As sisted living is a long-term care alternative which involves the delivery o f professiona lly managed personal and health care services in a group setting that i s residential in character and appearance in ways that optimize the physical an d psychological independence of residents."
"Assiste d living is a service-rich residential environment designed to enable individuals with a ra nge of capabilities, disabilities, frailties and strengths to reside in a homelik e setting as long as possible."
Assisted living is defined in the study as "programs that offer congregate housing and supportiv e services with explicit or implicit commitment to respond to individua l prefer ences for help with health-care access, personal care and househol d maintenance."

General Article Definitions
A number of the general articles identified from 1992 to 1995 also provide definitions o f assiste d living.
These definitions are found in Exhibit 2.3, where they are organized by date.
I n general, definitions appear to build on past work in a field, and this literature review update is n o exception.
One can follow the progressive development over t ime of the definition from a very vague listing of services to a much richer treatment of the philosophy of assisted living.
While one might expect to observe a convergence on the definition of assisted living used in the literature, this has not yet been the case.
Assisted living is described in most provider trade publications as a residential option for the elderly who need some help with activities of daily living (ADLs) and possibly some minimal nursing care.
Most definitions from the literature refer to the provision of supportive personal care services and many explicitly mention either that assisted living residents do not require the intensity of care found in nursing homes or that residents have "limited medical needs" or require "minimal medical care."

Although there is some recognition of the significance of physical environment in assisted living (Diesenhouse, Rajecki, Provider , Riegel, Kramer, Wilson, Pressler, Chisolm and Hahn, Bruck and Widdes, and Braga), there is less indication in the literature of a general understanding of the assisted living philosophy.
Only the articles authored by Folkemer, Vick, Braga, and the editors of Provider , are explicit in their explanations of the importance of preserving the dignity an d independence of assisted living residents through architectural and design strategies.
Despite similarities among the association definitions and the literature definitions of assisted living, there is little consensus concerning the details of care provision and the importance of a n assisted living philosophy of care.
C.
SUGGESTED TYPOLOGIES
FOR
CLASSIFYING T
HE
RANGE
OF
ASSISTED LIVING FACILITIES
The 1992 Policy Synthesis classified assisted living facilities i nto three types: public housing, units in continuing care retirement communities (CCRCs), and freestanding facilities.
Thi s classification system was used because the available data and information were organized in this fashion.
Anot her typology, conceptualized by Lawton (1977; 1980) and further explained b y MacDonald, Remus, and Laing's (1994) research with a small sample o f elderly, contrasts "constant" and "accommodating" models of health and housing that can be used with assisted living.
Th e constant model entails admission and discharge policies and proc edures developed by management personnel.
The environment facilitates resident indep endence, but does not change over time.
The accommodation model is similar to an "aging in place" model where the environment changes over time and res idents stay in the facility until they need 24-hour nursing care.
MacDonald an d associates conducted focus group interviews with 29 subjects from a random stratified sample to determ ine the subjects' attitudes toward housing.
All subjects emphasized the importance o f maintaining their independence and the importance of continuity of care.
In attitudes towar d housing, however, the researchers found that the subjects divided into two groups, based on health and disabi lity.
Those subjects who were in poorer health and who were more disabled favore d adding servi ces and modifying the environment, or the accommodating model.
Those in bette r health and less disability favored the constant model where services provided and the environment would remain constant over time.
Heumann and Boldy (1993) have used another typology to classify international models of assisted living for low income and frail elderly.
This typology has two primary categories: 1 ) "predisposing conditions" and 2) "environmental dimensions."
Predisposing conditions are further divided into four secondary characteristics: 1) social values under which programs are conceived; 95SW00026
2-9
Lewin-VHI, Inc.
2) the extent of government resource commitment; 3) government operational level; and 4) the mix of prog ram ownership and management, public or private.
Social values includes four sub categories, ranging from the rejection model, the social service model, and the participation model, to the self-actualization model.
Environmental dimensions have two secondary characteristics: 1) program support emphasis and 2) lifestyle emphasis.
The program support emphasis is furthe r categorized into four continua, ranging from the housing to community service focus, conventional to sheltered housing design, visiting to on-site service delivery, and incremental to holisti c management.
Lifestyle emphasis assesses the extent to which the neighborhood and facility are segregated or integrated by age and whether the units are private or communal.
In an earlier work, Heumann and Boldy (1982) developed a way of categorizing and simplifying program variations by using three continua describing levels of services, privacy, and community sizes, respectively.
The service continuum ranges from the minimal service model with no on-site support to the service rich model with full on-site services, including nursing sta ff.
The privacy continuum ranges from a model with conventionally designed private units with no communal space to a model with only bedrooms remaining private.
The size continuum ranges from one to ten units, which makes support staf f costs prohibitive, to multiples of 100 plus units managed by a bureaucracy.
A typology developed by Gold and associates (1991) for nursing home special care units for seniors with cognitive impairment rates facilities dichotomously on 27 key variables, many of which are subjective (e.g., inside ambiance).
The authors maintain that "each type represents a unique, model constellation of patient care, staff, and administrative characteristics of the settings included in it" (Gold et al., 1991, p. 470).
The typology includes eight categories, including "ideal , uncultivated, heart of gold, rotten at the core, institutional, limited, conventional, and execrable."
An additional typology has been introduced by Mollica et al. in their May 1995 report for the National Academy for State Health Policy.
The three models identified in that study wer e "institutional or board and care," a new "housing and services" mod el, and a "purely service-oriented" model.
In the first model, aging-in-place is addressed in both t raditional board and care facilities and in frail elderly housing projects.
Facilities that fit into this model have residents with a range of ADL and other service needs; some residents may be totally independent and others may requir e significant assistance with ADLs.
States which separate the housing and service components o f assisted living provide greater flexibility to residents se eking to age-in-place, but they do not address the institutional character of traditional board and care facilities that still exist in many states.
The service delivery model licenses or contracts with the agency providing assisted living services that may be provided in housing settings.
Mollica et al.
(May , 1995) included a chart in their report which classifies states according to the model that best characterizes current state policy.

SIZE
AND
GROWTH
OF THE
ASSISTED LIVING INDUSTRY
The lack of a generally accepted definition of assisted living and lack of systematic counting of those facilities in large government surveys currently preclude precise counts of the curren t number of assisted living facilities, the current assisted living resident population, and the extent of industry growth.
Although the literature published since 1992 contains assertions that the number of assisted living facilities is increasing (e.g., Buss, 1994; Gamzon, 1993; Cook, January 1995; Nichols, January 1995; Vick, January 9, 1995; Currents , May 1995; Evans, September 18, 1995; Kane, 1995) there has been little concrete data available to assess growth systematically.
A 1993 "Overview of the Assisted Living Industry," produced by ALFAA and Coopers 
2-10
Lewin-VHI, Inc.
Lybrand reports that "there may be as many as 65,372 Assisted Living Type facilities, housin g between 104,803 and a million residents, depending on how assist ed living is defined."
The sources cited by the Overview include a 1992 study by Coopers 
The 1992 Policy Synthesis estimate, from which the number of units mentioned above is taken, is drawn from a 1990 study of all potential licensed board and care facilities conducted by Lewin-ICF for ASPE.
(This study did not count unlicensed board and care homes.)
A number of article s included in this literature review update cite the Lewin-VHI 199 2 Policy Synthesis or the 1993 ALFAA Overview.
Thus, estimates of assisted living facilities appear to be circular rather than systematic.
Mode rn Healthcare , a trade publication, has conducted at least two surveys of multi-uni t providers .
Results indicate an increase of six percent in CCRCs operated by respondents to th e survey from 1992 to 1993 (Pallarito, 1994).
The survey reports on the number of CCRCs, as well as independent living, assisted living, and nursing home beds.
Of the 87 entities reporting, 2 1 increased the number of their assisted living beds, while seven decreased the number of thei r assisted living beds.
The total number of assisted living beds in 1993 among these 87 CCRCs was 12,369.
Pallarito's 1995 article in Modern Healthcare titled "Assisted Living Captures Profitabl e Market Niche," indicates that there may be somewhere between 30,000 and 40,000 assisted living providers today.
A recent Consultant Pharmacist article similarly estimates that there are between 40,000 and 65,000 providers serving one million people.
This article cites estimates that the assisted livin g target population is expected to increase sixfold over the next 25 years, when a large portion of the baby boom generation enters their seventies.
It also cites predictions that more than seven million frail elderly persons will be candidates for assisted living by the year 2020 (Nichols, January, 1995).
The Washington Post has also reported "industry estimates" of 40,000 assisted living providers in the United States, serving 1 million people.
The Post, reflecting i nterviews with those in the industry, notes that the industry is expected to grow to serve three times that number of older people within the next ten years.
Other experts have predicte d that the industry will grow to become a $25 billionrevenue producing industry by the year 2000 (J. Baker, as cited in Pallarito, 1995).

CHAPTER III - PEOPLE, SETTINGS ,
AND
SERVICES
This chapter focuses on the people, settings, and services of assisted living.
We discuss residen t profiles and review the literature in terms of admission and discharge conventions fo r assisted living residents.
In addition, we summarize the literature on staff profiles for bot h profess ional and non-professional employees of assisted living facilities, review the literatur e concerning the importance of the physical environment in the philosophy of assisted living, an d review th e types of services that the literature associates with assisted living care packages .
Furthermore, we investigate whether these services are described as scheduled or non-scheduled, bundled or unbundled.
The presence or absence of skilled nursing and ancillary services and the scheduling of those kinds of services are additional i ssues addressed in the literature which we note in this chapter.
A.
PEOPLE, SETTINGS, 1.
AND
SERVICES DESCRIBED
IN THE
1992 POLICY SYNTHESIS
Admission Criteria
The 1992 Policy Synthesis found that there was little agreement in the literature on eligibility conventions for assisted living residents or on the person or persons who should make those kinds of determinations.
The literature generally indicated that assisted living was appropriate fo r medically stable individuals who did not require 24-hour nursing supervision or professional medical care.
However, many authors disagreed about whether cognitively impaired seniors or individuals with a number of physical disabilities would be best served in assisted living facilities.
The 1992 Policy Synthesis identified three central criteria used in screening new applicants for assis ted living: income, age, and functional capability.
Public facilities targeted low incom e populations, while non-public facilities appeared to targe t wealthier seniors.
With respect to age, we fou nd that: HUD had no age eligibility restrictions; most state-funded programs were limited t o residents over 60 years old; and a number of CCRCs were limited to residents over 62 years old, while other CCRCs were limited to 65 years as a minimum age.
Criteria on functional disabilit y ranged widely, depending on the type of facility and/or the location of the facility.
For instance, in 1992, HUD's Congregate Housing Services Program (CSHP) required that reside nts need assistance in three or more ADLs/IADLs, including eating or preparing meals and m ust have no informal support network (Struyk, 1989).
Although most state-f unded facilities required that seniors have impairment in at least one ADL task, Massachusetts and New Jersey admitted seniors who were socially isolated but functionally intact.
The 1992 Policy Synthesis pointed out that the Fair Housing Amendments Act of 1988, by including disabled individuals as a group protected from housing discrimination, and the Americans with Disabilities Act could have significant ramifications for assisted living and could have a direct effect on eligibility requirements.
The 1992 Policy Synthesis determined that transfer decisions appeared to be mad e systematically within assisted living facilities but the parties res ponsible for making transfer decisions varied between facilities.
For instance, in public facilitie s housing managers generally performed the initial assessments, while in CCRCs and private assisted living facilities case managers were more likely to perform initial screening assessments.
In some CCRCs and private facilities, a facilit y physician or nurse performed the assessment.

Services
Services provided by assisted living facilities varied widely across facilities, as shown i n Exhibit 3.1, which is taken from the 1992 Policy Synthesis.
This tabl e synthesizes services provided in four surveys: 1) a survey of Section 202 Housing (Gayda 
These surveys demonstrate that there was little consensus on a core set of services.
3.
Staff
The 1992 Policy Synthesis determined that staffing pattern s, ratios, and professionalism also varied widely across assisted living facilities.
Although it was difficult to generalize, the 1992 Policy Synthesis found that staff roles in assisted living facilities were less differentiated than those found in faci lities providing more traditional care.
The literature described the following staff positions : housekeepers, kitchen workers, maintenance personnel, transportation staff, and managerial and clerical staff.
A 1992 American Health Care Association (AHCA) study found that the averag e member residential care facility who typically had 50 beds employed 3 management personnel, 5 nurses, 13 aides, 9 dietary staff, and 4 housekeepers.
The AHCA member facilities also reported employing a number of other types of staff: an activities director (82 per cent), a pharmacy consultant (70 percent), a RN consultant (60 percent), a dietitian (45 percent), a physical therapist (36 percent), and a social worker (46 percent).
With regard to staff ratios, Moon (1989) found a mean staffin g ratio of 3.2 residents per staff member in the seven stat es studied with a staff to resident ratio range from 2.8 to 4.7.

AND
ADMISSION
AND
DISCHARGE
The literature from 1992 to the present provides some general information about th e residents of assisted living facilities, but provides little information about who is eligible, how and by whom eligibility is determined, or who is excluded from assisted l iving.
Most of the information about residents of assisted living facilities comes from two studies: 1) a study by ALFAA and Coopers 
The study by ALFAA and Coopers 
The data come from 201 facilities, representing 6,119 units in 25 states.
For-profit assisted living facilities represented 75 percent of the sample, 4 percent wer e publicly-held and 21 percent were non-profit.
The Kane and Wilson (1993) study had two components: a national study of assisted living and a study of assisted living in the state of Oregon.
The national study included interviews with a national sample of administrators of 63 assisted living facilities; 65 percent of the facilities were forprofit, 35 percent were non-profit programs.
In most cases, this study was restricted to facilities with 15 or more residents.
Oregon was studied se parately because the state has "gone further than any other in defining assisted living through regulations, encouraging purpose-built assisted livin g programs through incentives for developers, and providing a reimbursement source for the car e component of the program" (Kane 
The Oregon sample includes 20 of the 22 licensed programs in the state with 947 tenants in residence at the time of the study.
Data from the national study and the Oregon study are reported separately b y Kane and Wilson and are treated separately in this review.
1.
Vital Statistics: Average Age, Gender, and Marital Status
The ALFAA study provides a resident profile drawn from the assisted living facilitie s respondin g to their survey: 79 percent of residents are female with an average age of 85; mal e residents average 83 years (ALFAA and Coopers 
In their national study, Kane and Wilson (1993) found that the average age for residents was 83 years.
The Oregon residents were predominately female (75 percent) with an avera ge age of 85, and 97 percent were unmarried.
In a s tudy of the relationship of assisted living residents to health care utilization, Newcomer an d Preston (1994) found that the average age o f residents in two CCRCs was 82.2 years and that 76.7 were fem ale.
In a second study the average age at entry was 79.3 years and 72.4 percent wer e female (Newcomer, Preston, 
In addition to the aforementioned studies, Coopers 
This study found that assisted living facilities generally serve a population of single females in their early 80's.
The prototypical assisted living resident was an 81.8 year-old female.
In fact, only 19 percent of assisted living residents were male, according to the findings of this study.
95SW00026
3-4
Finally, the vast majority of residents (more than 97 percent) in these facilities are unmarried or are not living with their spouse.
2.
ADL Impairment
The ALFAA study found that assisted living residents have a mean number of 3.06 AD L impairments and 42 percent have some cognitive impairment.
Th ey also found that typical residents were female s needing "moderate or heavy care."
The residents frequently needed help wit h ambulating, medicines, bathing and/or dressing and were forgetful.
Kane and Wilson report that a summary classification scheme used by the State of Oregon to classify Medicaid clients determined that the Oregon sample had more physical and cognitive impairment than the national sampl e studied by Kane and Wilson, as shown in Exhibit 3.2.

Admission and Discharge a.
Factors Influencing Admission and Discharge Patterns
Researchers report in recent literature that, among other things, age at entry into a senior housing facility "significantly affects the likelihood of assisted-living and nursing unit use in al l residents' models..."
More extensive analysis of admission and discha rge patterns between assisted living facilities and nursing units is greatly needed in order to provide a more comprehensive picture of the role t hat assisted living plays in the larger chronic care industry, and to inform intereste d parties about the impact of transfers on total costs.
The effect of transfers on residents' health care utilization will be discussed in the section on effectiveness of assisted living (Newcomer, Roderick, and Preston, June 1995).
The development of widely applicable admission and discharge criteria is an important issue facing the assisted living industry.
Some industry experts believe that as much as 20 to 30 percent of nursing home residents would be more appropriately serv ed in assisted living communities (Clipp, 1995).
The magnitude of that estimate suggests that these so-called "inappropriate" placement s may have a significant impact on overall health care costs for the frail elderly in this country.
b. Source of Admission
The ALFAA-Coopers 
95SW00026
3-5
To better understand how elders are referred to residential care settings, one researcher has recently studied patterns of decision making for seniors' transfers into residential care facilities (Bear, 1993).
Using a sample of 86 primary caregivers of elderly residents n ewly admitted to central Florida residential care settings, this study examined the admission patterns of residents described a s unable to stay in their current residence (prior to residential care placement) and their subsequent referral to the residential care facility.
The majority (68.5 percent) of seniors were labeled "out-ofplace" and 75.6 percent were referred by informal primary caregivers.
Physicians labeled 25.
6 percent of the seniors out-of-place and referred 15.1 percent of the seniors to the residential care setting.
Health professionals were more likely to do the labeling during a hospitalization.
The study found that caregivers of this sample of residents differed from a national sample of caregivers; they were more frequently white, younger, and better educated than the national sample.
ALFAA's survey reports somewhat different referral patterns in its Overview of the Assisted Living In dustry : 25 percent of the residents in the facilities responding to the survey were referred by f amily members, while 20 percent were referred by hospitals, 14 percent were referred b y physicians, and 14 percent were self-referrals.
c. Admission and Retention Criteria
Some useful background to the discussion of admission criteria for assisted living facilities is provided in a recent national study on board and care homes (Hawes, et al., 1995).
The authors do not expli citly describe a set of characteristics or eligibility requirements for board and car e residents, except that such residents tend to need temporary, part-time nursing care and som e assistance with ADLs.
In terms of discharge conventions, 44 percent of licensed board and care homes and 56 percent of unlicensed board and care homes (assisted living facilities would mos t likely fall under this category) reported that they would discharge a r esident who needed nursing care for more than 14 days.
The discharge sites li sted were hospitals (acute or Veterans Administration) and nursing homes (Hawes et al., 1995, p. 17).
The Kane and Wilson (1993) national study also examined admission and retention policies for the assisted living facilities they studied.
All but one of the 63 facilities surveyed would admit an individual who was mildly confused.
All 63 facilities would retain a resident who was mildly confused and all had at least one mildly confused resident.
In contrast, 45 of the 63 facilities would admit an individual wi th moderate confusion and 55 of the 63 would retain an individual with moderat e confusion.
Fifty-three out of the 63 facilities actually had residents with moderate confusion.
I n addition, only 12 of the 63 facilities would admit individuals using a ventilator and 12 of the 63 would retain a resident on a ventilator.
Of those 12 faci lities, only three actually had one or more residents on a ventilator.
Exhibit 3.3 presents the table on admission and retention policies from the Kane and Wilson study.
Although the authors found that a certain number of facilities would admit and/or retain individuals conditionally with selected conditions, these facilities have been omitted from the table.

State regulations increasingly influence who is eligible to become an assisted living resident as well as the length of time that a resident may remain in a particular facility.
The recent Guide to Assisted Liv ing and State Policy (Mollica et al., May, 1995) provides some important analysis o f admission and discharge regulations.
This report indicates that 17 states have admission criteria that admit only those residents who require nursing facility level of care or skilled services (Mollica et al., 1995, ix).
However, it seems that resident policies which prohibit anyone needing nursing hom e level of services from being served are being reexamined.
As Mollica et al. argue, "assisted living has been developed as an alternative for people who qualify for placement in a nursing facility i n most states" (Mollica et al., p. 45).
Current ly, the State of Virginia does not allow bedfast residents to enter assisted livin g facilities, although those residents who become bedfast after admission to the facility may remain.
In addition, the state of Missouri requires that assisted living residents be capable of walking within 45 days of admission (Provider , August, 1993).
Regulations prepared for the state of Florida prohibit residen ts with certain conditions from remaining in assisted living facilities (called extende d congregate care in Florida).
These conditions include: needing 24-hour nursing supervision, being bedridden for more than two consecutive weeks, de pendency in four or more ADLs, or being unable to make simple decisions due to cognitive impairment (Rajecki, 1992).
Mollica et al. also contributed some valuable information on the topic of admission criteria.
Their Guide to Assisted Living and State Policy specifically differentiated state licensing rules that specify admissions criteria from the program requirements that establish such criteria.
In addition, Mollica et al. explored two important distinctions in the determination of admissions criteria.
Their study explains that state licensure rules often establish guidelines regarding who may be served in an assisted living facility regardless of payer source.
However, state reimbursement policy ma y establish specific criteria for residents that will be reimbursed through Medicaid in assisted living.
c. Length of Stay
The average length of stay reported by ALFAA is 2.2 years wit h a median of 2.0 years.
Kane and Wil son's national study of 63 assisted living facilities for AARP found that assisted livin g
95SW00026
3-7
residents had an average length of stay of 26 months.
The most frequently cited reasons fo r res idents leaving in the Kane and Wilson national study were: 1) the need for greater care; 2 ) behavioral problems; 3) improvement in functioning; 4) not enough funds; and 5) spous e died/moved.
In contrast, other researchers have found a mean length of stay in seven CCRCs to be 7.5 years (Newcomer, Preston, and Roderick, June, 1995).
It has also been reported tha t females average more than six month longer lengths of stay than males in both assisted living and nursing units (Newcomer, Preston, and Roderick, June, 1995). d. Discharge Criteria
Lite rature produced in the last six months has contributed to the body of information o n dis charge patterns among assisted living residents.
A report on one 400-resident facility wit h indepen dent living units, assisted living units, and skilled nursing in the same setting indicate s anecdotally that transfers between levels of care are frequent (Young 
Both the ALFAA study and Kane and Wilson's national study appear to confirm that transfers out of assisted living are frequent.
ALFAA reports an annual mean turnover rate of 34 percent and that the greatest number of residents discharged from the assisted living facilities surveyed go to nursing homes (46 percent) with the next greatest numbers of residents discharged due to death (24 percent) o r discharged to the hospital (12 percent).

Mollica et al. explain that in many states "maximum thresholds" are established, that is, some states specify which types of residents must be discharged.
Although the report indicates that these discharge rules are fairly broad, they do allow facilities to determine the types of needs that can be met within their facility through the resident agreement process.
e. Discharge Destinations
In examining resident discharge destinations from assisted living facilities involved in their national study, Kane and Wilson found that, in the previous year, 26 of 59 assisted living facilities reported that 25 percent or more of their residents who moved out went to a nursing home and 11 of 59 repo rted that 50 percent or more of move-outs went to a nursing home.
Twenty out of 5 9 facilities reported that 25 percent or more of their residen ts go to the hospital and do not return while 17 of the 59 facilities reported that 25 percent or more went to the hospital and died.
Six of the 59 facilities reported that 25 percent or more of residents who moved out went to an independent living setting while two reported that 25 percent or more went to other assisted living facilities.
Kane and Wilson point o ut that "substantial numbers died in the assisted living setting or died after a shor t hospitalization" and that "depending on one's view of t he desirable capacity for assisted living, these figures are encouraging because they suggest many people can remain in the setting until death or shortly before" (Kane 
95SW00026
3-8
Kane and Wilson (1993) also studied the discharge destinations of 371 Oregon residents who left the 20 facilities since 1990.
They found that 66 died in the assisted living facility, 64 wer e discharged to a nursing home, 49 were discharged to their own home, 48 went to a hospital and died after hospitalization.
C.
ARCHITECTURE AS AN IMPORTANT COMPONENT
OF THE
ASSISTED LIVING PHILOSOPHY
A core tenet of the philosophy of assisted livin g is that the assisted living setting is important to both the physical and psychological well-being of the frail elderly.
Many recent definitions o f assisted living employ words like "homelike" to describe the ideal assisted living setting, and some experts argue that caregivers and health professionals should use "the residential environment as the basis for therapeutic intervention" (Regnier, 1994, p. 3).
A growing interest in the role of physical environment and architecture, in particular, a s issues in assisted living is demonstrated by a burgeoning literature on the topic.
Two recent books on architecture and assisted living (Regnier, 1994; Salmon, 1993) and seven articles (Bauer, 1992; Building Design 
1.
Regni er's Architectural Criteria for Assisted Living and His Influence on th e Current Literature on Architectural Criteria
Regnier uses nine criteria to define assisted living facilities.
They are: 1) appear residential in character; 2) perceived as small in size; 3) provide resid ential privacy and completeness (i.e., with a full bathroom and a kitchenette at a minimum); 4) recognize the uniqueness of each resident; 5) foster independence, interdependence, and individuality; 6) focus on health maintenance, physical movement, and mental stimulation; 7) support family involvement; 8) maintain connections with the surrounding community; and 9) serve the frail elderly (Regnier, 1992, 1994).
Tech nological advances may change assisted living facilities even more in the future .
Regnier m aintains that "as new forms of robotics and communications technology challenge th e concept of institutional control, assisted living will become an even more popular avenue for caring for the frail" (Regnier, 1994, p. 1).
To support Regnier's nine-point analysis, recent non-architectural literature is beginning to define assisted living facilities in terms of several of his criteria.
Robert and Rosalie Kane note in their 1995 JAMA article that many states now license facilities with the name "assisted living" only if they feature single-occupancy apartment units with full bathrooms and kitchenettes.
In addition, in con sideration of Regnier's other criteria of "independence, interdependence, and individuality, " man y experts are promoting the notion of "aging in place."
Closely linked with planning an d development around physical structure, "aging in place," as discussed by Ivry and others, requires that the assisted living unit be adaptable in its design so that a resident with increasing ADL needs could be accommodated in that same unit over a period of time.
The AARP has also contributed to the literature regarding the confluence betwee n archit ecture and the philosophy of assisted living.
Citing Regnier's work and consistent with th e findings of the ALFAA study and the Kane and Wilson study, a recent AARP policy brief describes the range of design elements found in assisted living facilities.
Two unit types are described: the first is a private room with bath, individual temperature controls, and locking doors and the second
95SW00026
3-9
is a sm all apartment with a kitchenette.
The policy brief also indicates that many assisted livin g facilities include a laundry, central kitchen, and recreational areas in order to support the services that are included with the residents' rental packages.
Resident choice over decor, including th e increasingly popular option for residents to supply their own furnishings, is one of many steps toward the goal of creating a home-like environment.
Another step is the creation of small sitting room s around the facility to encourage residents to interact with one another and with guests.
In addition, many facilities avoid the use of fluorescent lighting, long corridors, tiling and other design features that are more consistent with the bygone institutional paradigm.
While promoting this home-lik e interior design idea, many assisted living facilities must also provide standard safety features to aid frail residents with mobility problems.
Handrails, wide hallways, grab bars, emergency call systems, and other security features are present in many facilities.
2.
Autonomy-enhancing Features
Many design features are thought to contribute to residents' independence and autonom y in assisted living facilities.
Kane and Wilson (1993) found in their national study that 26 of the 63 facilities exclusively had private units with 24 more having more private than double-occupancy units and four with equal numbers of single- and double-occupancy units.
The ALFAA study (1993) does not provide any indication of how many units are single or double occupancy.
In Exhibit 3.5, a comparison of some features considered to be a utonomy-enhancing from the ALFAA and Kane and Wilson studies are presented.
In their national study, Kane and Wilson (1993) found that residents in 47 out of 63 facilities had the capability to lock their doors.
(This issue is not discussed in the ALFAA report.)

They also found that residents were not allowed t o have stoves in 44 facilities, although they were not allowed to have refrigerators in only 14 facilities.
Th e prohibition against stoves may reflect concerns about fire hazards.
The conflict between autonomy-enhancing features of assisted living and state regulatory and licensure stipulations will be discussed in a later chapter.
The 1995 Guide to Assisted Livi ng and State Policy also addressed this issue of autonomyenhancing features.
Mollica et al. argue that "while some contend that apartment style models raise costs and r equire features that residents may or may not use or that may be harmful (stoves , microwaves), others contend that kitchens or kitchenettes do not add significant costs, can be safe and provide an ambiance that is familiar and encourages autonomy" (Mollica et al., p. iii).
3.
Current Architectural Prototypes and Standards
Ass isted living buildings themselves vary a great deal between freestanding facilities wit h relatively few residents, to large multi-structure complexes supporting three levels of housing : independent housing, assisted living, and skilled nursing.
The AARP policy brief (February, 1995) reports that assisted living facilities vary in size from those that accommodate 15 or fewer residents to those which house 100 or more residents.
Newly constructed facilities are typically designed to accommodate between 30 and 70 residents, which planners and deve lopers believe is small enough to ensure that the facility will retain a non-institutional atmosphere but large enough to allo w economies of scale in the provision of services.
Other researchers have found that the proportion of total units allocated to assisted living may in so me way contribute to a predisposition in the facility to rely on institutional service approaches.
They suggest that this institutional quality may b e reflected in operational practices developed in large complexes or in the mix of residents self selecting admission into these facilities (Newcomer et al., 1995).
Recent research on assisted living and nursing unit use among CCRC residents found a significant difference in use between so called "high-rise" and "garden" complexes.
Total days of assisted living use are decreased by almost six months for those frail elderly who reside in high rise facilities.
Many factors, including the recent evidence that the proper res idence for dementia patients is a garden complex as opposed to a potentially disorienting high-rise, may partially explain th e results of this research (Newcomer et al., 1995).
4.
State Architectural Models
Mollica et al. discussed the issue of architecture in their report as well.
They reviewed the three general architectural requirements of various state policies: 1) some states required apartment settings in order to maximize the home-like quality sought through assisted living; 2) other stat e
95SW00026
3-11
regulations required private bedrooms with attached baths or double occupancy bedrooms shared by agreement of residents; and 3) a last category of states mandated that assisted living facilities offer shared bedrooms or bathing facilities that may not be attached to the room and can be shared by more than two residents of the facility.
5.
Architectural Comparisons With European Models
One researcher has identified a number of basic elements in assisted living facilities in the United Kingdom (also known as residential care homes) (Salmon, 1993).
In the United Kingdom, some of the se typical basic elements include a private bed-sitting room with its own front doo r opening into a corridor, and communal sitting rooms for residents who wish to socialize.
Th e entrance is welcoming and has places for residents to sit outsid e.
There is a larger, main communal lounge f or larger social activities.
There are planned group activities and outings.
There ar e qualified care staff on call 24-hours a day, all housekeeping is provided, lunch and the evening meals are served in a communal dining room.
Regnier maintains that there are 20 differences in practice and philosophy between U.S. and European assisted living facilities.
Differences in communit y servic es, the relationship of the facility to its surrounding context, and participatory models tha t incorporate residents in decision-making are a few of the distinctive issues.
Regnier points out that while we can learn from the European models of assisted living, the U.S. is not going to become a heavily socialized welfare state.
He predicts that as a result, the European model will not become the American model.

SERVICES PROVIDED BY ASSISTED LIVING FACILITIES
This secti on focuses on the services provided by assisted living facilities.
A number o f general art icles in the assisted living literature mention services or the fact that facilities provid e assistance with ADLs, but are not specific about the services provided.
In reviewing the definitions of assisted living in Exhibit 2.3, a number of authors define assisted living primarily by its bundled and unbundled services (e.g., Diesenhouse, 1993; Stuart, 1993; Walser, 1994; Business Wire , 4/19/95; PR Newswire, 8/8/95).

Survey Literature On Services
Two surveys published since 1992 have addressed the issue of services in assisted living facilities.
The Coopers 
In addition, the Kane and Wilson (1993) national study of 63 providers for AARP also has examined services provided in assisted living facilities.
These two studies, with some anecdotal information from other sources, provide most of the information included in this section.
The numbers and kinds of services available may be dependent on residents' ability to pay.
Both ALFAA- Coopers 
These services ar e commonly called "unbundled" services or "amenities."
Kane and Wilson (1993) found that "when asked to list the services provided, respondents typically listed meals, housekeeping, transportation, laundry and linen service, activities, medication monitor ing, and assistance with bathing and dressing.
Many settings mentioned having add-o n levels of c are that could be purchased separately" (Kane 
The author s categorized facility responses into three levels of services: 1) relatively heavy services provided; 2) relatively light services provided; and 3) graduated services provided.
Due to the diversity o f services provided in the facilities, the authors did not quantify the number of facilities in eac h category.
One respondent involved in the Kane and Wilson study described "heavy services" as "24hour supervision; emergency call system, nurse on staff so there is nursing supervision around the clock; assistance with ADLs; medication supervision; per sonal care staff; beautician comes weekly-extra char ge; daily exercise program; daily social activities (i.e., recreation, rides, shopping) ; transp ortation program; housekeeping services; three meals a day; provide for special diets ; bathroom s are safety equipped; laundry" (Kane 
Relatively "light" services wer e described by another provider: "We provide housekeeping every two weeks and a daily continental breakfast.
Dinner is purchased off a meal card an d must be selected by 1:00 p.m.
We have an `I'm O.K.' system where a button needs to be press ed by 9:30 a.m. and 9:30 p.m. daily or we will check; 24-hour emergency call system; on-site caretaker to residents after 10:00 p.m.; bus provide s transportation to MD's appointment, bank and so on.
[Home health agency] provides any personal care services on a fee-for-service basis" (Kane 
Finally, an example of a respondent's description of graduated services provided is given: "Medication monitoring--if w e dispense medications there is an additional charge; option of three meals; activities; transportation; housekeeping; and maintenance.
Base line personal care--one bath per week, help with dressing, grooming, and ambulation.
Podiatrist and physician within our building can be seen for fee-for service" (Kane

In addition to the Kane and Wilson and ALFAA-Coopers 
Because assisted living is a subset of the larger Board and Care category of seniors housing, the findings of the Hawes et al. stu dy are valuable as an additional source of information.
Moreover, the Board and Care study results can be a useful tool for analysis bec ause it may show discrepancies due to the absence of the assisted living philosophy in man y Board and Care facilities.
We would expect, therefore, to identify characteristics of these "non autonomy-enhancing" and "non-aging-in-place" facilities in the data of the Hawes et al. study results.
Exhibit 3.7 is a compilation of the results of the national board and care study (Hawes et al., 1995) and it shows several points of similarity with the ALFAA-Coopers 
Mea l service s, personal care services, and administration of medication are the three most prevalen t services cited in board and care homes.
Personal care services are reportedly less often included in the package of services in board and care facilities as compared to the ALFAA-Coopers 
These lower percentages (9 2 percent for licensed board and care homes and 62 percent for unlicensed board and care homes compared to 98 percent of assisted living facilities) may be due to the board and care homes that do not adhere to the philosophy of assisted living.
Instead, these facilities may concentrate on the housing that they provide, rather than creating a balance between housing and services that i s sought in assisted living facilities.
In addition, it is interesting to note that medication administration appears to be slightly more common in board and care homes (99 percent of licensed board an d care homes and 76 percent of unlicensed board and care homes compared t o 89 percent of assisted living facilities).

Non-Survey Literature on Services
In addition to the major survey sources, a number of other articles have addressed the issue of services.
A summary of the core services and am enities contained in these articles can be found in Exhibit 3.9.
A comparison of these articles demonstrates that the consensus being developed in the area of services is based around meal services (generally three meals a day), housekeeping services (including laundry), and personal care (including assistance with ADLs).
The June 199 5 policy brief published for the AARP describes in some detail the kinds o f services that can be expected from an assisted living facility.
This brief explains that the "typical" assisted living facility offers assistance with at least one ADL and as sistance can usually be obtained 24-hours a day.
Most facilities offer a standard "package" of services, but they bundle the m differently and some provide additional "unbundled" services at extra charge.
Skilled nursing and ancillary care are noted as examples of care that may be packaged through third-party providers.
Socia l services like assistance with arranging doctors appointments and other activities are als o usually provided.
The scheduling of services is cited as an important issue for assisted livin g facilities because of the need to follow the philosophy of resident autonomy.
Accordingly, residents often have the option of carrying out some tasks on their own and family members are ofte n encouraged to participate in food preparation and other tasks.
Kane and Kane assume in their 1995 JAMA article that assisted living, by definition, should supply three meals a day and provide on-site staff.
In addition, they describe assisted living as an approach which allows residents to be treated as "tenants" with full rights of refusal of care.
In this rather subtle point emerges one of the most contentious issues in the assisted living industry.
The issue of residents' rights to self-medicate, to ignore prescribed diets, or to take on some tasks not included in their care plan has served to further complicate a discussion of "core services" i n assisted living.
State regulatory and licensure issues and legal battles regarding "managed risk " make it difficult to define assisted living by its services, because inherently, those services will vary
95SW00026
3-16
by patient as well as by facility.
Another industry observer lists meal services, housekeeping services, administration o f medica tions, assistance with personal care, and some structured social activities as a typica l package of assisted living services (Pfeiffer, 1995).
Currents , a publication of the America n Association of Homes and Services for the Aging, lists its set of cor e services in the May 1995 issue.
The editors included daily meal service, basic housekeeping, laundry, help with bathing, medication as sistance, emergency medical services, 24-hour security, transportation, activity and wellnes s programs, and service coordination in their version of the assisted living service package.
ALFAA's Assisted Living Today (Clipp, Summer 1995) compiled a similar list based o n interviews with three assisted living providers.
Core services were defined as three meals per day, weekly housekeeping and linens, emergency response, seven hours per week of assistance wit h activities of daily living (ADLs), weekly transportation to and from doctors appointments (two trips per week, average distance of five to ten miles), activities (three per week), medication reminders, care management, and over-night companion service.
Finally, another industry observer maintains that the typical services provided by assiste d living facilities include: "three meals a day, regular housekeeping and laundry service, assistance in dressing, bathing, and walking, social activities; (and) some limited medical supervision" (Evans, 1994).
4.
Current State Policy on Assisted Living Services
Mollica et al. review state policies on assisted living in the NASHP study published in 1995.
They explain that state rules all allow or require the provision of per sonal care or personal assistance services arranged by assisted living facilities.
However, the authors warn that there is significant variance in the extent to which skilled nursing services may be provided.
In fact, they point out that some states specifically limit the number of days that skilled nursing may be provided.
In general, Mollica et al. have found that state policies on assisted living allow for the provision of a servic e package that includes some nursing services, the need for services on an unscheduled basis, the development of an individualized service plan, access to ancillary services, and the opportunity for special services (e.g., extra assistance for dementia patients) (Mollica et al., p. 10).
Many observers believe that it is good for the assisted living industry to develop differently in various regions of the country.
Some observers, however, suggest th at the lack of standardization of services provided by assisted living facilities in different states and regions can lead to unrealistic expectations of the long-term care model and resulting vulnerability to liability suits (Olson, 1994).
Indeed, a rece nt Washington Post story on the death of an assisted living resident asserts tha t expectations about the services provided may not match the actual services being provided (Vick, 1994).

NEEDS ASSESSMENTS
AND
REEVALUATIONS
In addition to the development of a core set of services for the assisted living industry, many experts are also interested in assessing the delivery of those services to residents in the form of care plans or "needs assessments."
The literature produced in the last several years offers few insights into the actual organization and oversight of initial needs assessments and reevaluations.
Kane and Wilson (1993) in their national study for AARP asked question s about admission procedures in order to determine how care planning was accomplished and how individualized care plans are developed and implemented in these facilities.
They found that 30 of the 63 facilities had a pre-admission evaluation process and that 26 of the 63 used a systematic formal care plan.
Twenty-three completed a forma l assessment form.
Families were involved in assessments in 31 of the 63 facilities and a nurse was involved in 26 of the facilities .
In general, "the assessment described varied enormously in their content, their degree o f standardization, and their intensity" (Kane 
The authors further found that reevaluations were common in approximately 25 percent of the facilities, with some having a formal reevaluation system and some an informal system.
Kane and Kane indicate in their 1995 JAMA article that individually planned care is a critical part of the assisted living concept, but they give no additional information regarding how that care is planned, from admission through an organized re-evaluation process.
More extensive analysis of the prototypical evaluation and care planning process is included in the June 1995 AARP policy brief.
That brief describes a process by which "before moving in, th e resident or family member describes the resident's needs and works with the staff to decide what help will be provided and how and when."

STAFFING NEEDS
AND
STAFF-TO- RESIDENT RATIOS
IN
ASSISTED LIVING FACILITIES
Since the services provided in assisted living facilities and the care plans that are developed for residents are created by people, it is important to explore the role of staffing in assisted living.
Topics in the literature on the issue of staffing include staff-to-resident ratios, the education and skill levels of staff in assisted living facilities, the position of staff as direct employees or contracted staff, and the impact that staff make on the quality of life and improvement of health among residents.
Exhibit 3.10 compares the staffing patterns described from three surveys of assisted living facilities and the National Board and Care survey.
Kane and Wilson (1993), ALFAA (Coopers 
(July, 1995) all contribute some information on the topics of median staff size , staffing ratios, labor categorization, staff regulations, and staff training.
The discussions below compare these four surveys on several topics relevant to staffing.

Variations in Staffing Patterns
As Exhibit 3.9 demonstrates, there is a lack of systematic, comparable information on th e topic of staffing.
Thus, it is difficult to assemble a model of staffing patterns for the assisted living industry as a whole, especially due to the wide range of staffing p atterns.
This wide range of staffing patterns may reflect, in part, the diversity of residents served by assisted living.
Kane and Wilson found that "staffing patterns related to whether the setting was freestanding, part of a nursing home or CCRC, or a housing complex; whether the setting was large or small; how the state regulate d assisted living; and so forth" (Kane 
2.
Staffing Statistics: Median Staff Size and Staff-to-Resident Ratios a.
Survey literature on staffing statistics
The Kane and Wilson study, found that the median staff for the national study of 63 settings was 20.5 (ra nge 3 to 60).
Due to the complexity of non-comparable labor categories, staffin g variation by time of day, and the level of detail involved in the data coll ection, Kane and Wilson report that they were unable to create a staff-to-resident ratio that was meaningful across all facilities.
Staffing ratios may be related to the level of care and time of day.
One facility described in recent literature has staff-to-resident ratios of .08 to .10 dur ing the day and .03 at night while another provider has staff-to-resident ratios of .076 in their assisted living facility (Evans, 1994).
ALFAA Coopers 
A similar staff-to-resident ratio (.33) for one facility specializing in residents with head trauma was reported in another recent research article (Bowe, 1993). b. Non-Survey Literature on Staffing Statistics
Staffing patterns have also been discussed in the non-survey literature.
One article reports one 50 to 60 resident facility had 35 caregivers, programming personnel, service coordinators, and assistants (Bruck and Widdes, 1995).
The staff-to-resident ratio for each "house" in the facility was .16.
This is considerably lower than the ASHA-Coopers 
The ratio in the facility at large (which reflects th e consideration that residents will come into contact with staff who do not necessarily concentrate on their particular "house") was closer to .25 (Bruck and Widdes, 1995).
3.
Labor Categories: Types of Staff and Staffing Responsibilities a.
Survey Literature on Labor Categories
In addres sing the types of staff employed directly and under contract by assisted livin g facilities in their national sample, Kane and Wilson identified four general labor categories.
These four groups, administration, kitchen, housekeeping, and care staff were the most frequently directly employed by facilities.
In general, Kane and Wilson found that few medically skilled staff were used by facilities in their nat ional study.
They found that RNs and LPNs were used by some of the facilities, but fe w facilities employed a facility physician.
The Board and Care study results from Hawes et al. confirm the findings of Kane and Wilson.
Kane and Wilson found that 21 percent of assisted living facilities had RNs on staf f and that 24 percent had LPNs on staff.
Similarly, Hawes et al. found that 2 1 percent of ho mes employed full- or part-time RNs or LPNs.
Both studies found extensive use o f 3-22 Lewin-VHI, Inc.
95SW00026
nurses aides and personal care aides in place of RNs or LPNs.
This trend, considered by som e observers of the assisted living industry to be a potential cau se for concern, will be discussed further below.
The number of staff employed on contract with outside agencies is another topic addressed in the survey literature on staffing patterns.
I n the Kane and Wilson study, outside consultants were use d by 46 of the 63 settings, with a wide variety of specialty consultants, including beauticians , nutritionists, podiatrists, and physicians.
Home health agencies provided care to at least some of the residents at 48 of the 63 facilities.
A comparison between Kane and Wilson and the Hawes et al. study suggests that assisted living facilities employ a larger num ber of contracted staff.
Kane and Wilson found that 73 percent of the facilities in their study had outside consultants of several types (beautici ans to physicians), and 76 percent had at least some outside home health agenc y employees.
In contrast, board and care homes used outside cont ractors much less frequently.
Only 18 percent of licensed facilities contracted with a home health agency (27 percent of unlicense d facilities did the same).
In other categories of ancillary care, Board and Care homes consistentl y used very few outside contractors.
Only in the category of e pisodic nursing care did Board and Care homes approach a significant use level (53 percent of Board and Care homes reported that outside agencies were contracted for episodic nursing care).
In assessments of both the care staff patterns and the frequency of outside contracting, it is useful to note the Hawes et al. data for unlicensed board and care homes.
The data for thes e homes appears to more closely match those of the Kane and Wilson data.
Hawes et al. hav e spec ulated that a large number of the unlicensed homes they surveyed are in fact assisted livin g fa cilities that do not yet have a licensure category under their particular state statutes.
Thi s hypothesis would help to explain the convergence in staffing patterns between assisted livin g facilities in the Kane and Wilson study and the unlicensed Board and Care homes in the Hawes et al. study.
b. Non-Survey Literature on Labor Categories
There are several different staffing models common to assisted living facilities.
The types of staff hired and the patterns of their daily work vary widely from facility to facility.
The non-survey literature provides detailed descriptions of a number of these staffing models and the characteristic labor categories involved.
One provider, quoted in a non-survey literature source, mainta ins that "food service accounts for approximately 27 percent of staff time and housekeeping for 13 percent at the average assisted living community" (Evans, 1994, p. 55).
Since Evans reports that a total of 40 percent of staff time is devoted to meals and housekeeping, one might assume that assisted living facilities staf f concentrate on services unrelated to nursing functions.
At Arden Courts, another facility cited in the literature, the core staff team is made up o f "Resident Caregivers" who are also known as "houseparents.''
The role of the Resident Caregiver is to assist with ADLs.
Assigned to a particular house (the facility is composed of several self contained houses), they work with a group of residents every day and get to know their individual care needs.
The staff work in three shifts, like nursing home staff, but in all other ways, this facility and other similar assisted living facilities, are staffed in very different ways.
Experience an d personality are two key factors in hiring policy that are highly valu ed by the operators of Arden Courts (Bruck and Widdes, May, 1995).
Another staffing model discussed in the provider trade literat ure involving facilities sponsored by National HealthCare L.P. has RNs on site, supervision and administration of medication , 95SW00026
3-23
Lewin-VHI, Inc.
counseling and health assessments ( Business Wire , April 19, 1995).
The non-survey literature has also contributed some substantive commentary on the subject of ancillary care provided by outside contractors.
One industry observer argues that future growth in the assisted living industry will come in the greater availability of ancillary and physician services on-site (Cook, 1995).
These relationships between providers of ancillary care and assisted livin g operators often will be developed through contracts and lease arrangements, but they will also be expanded through contracts with contractors who will provide complete packages of home health services to assisted living facilities.

As this chart demonstrates, state policies concerning staffin g patter ns vary widely.
The one point of consensus among the statutes is the obligation of facilit y operators to employ an "adequate" number of employees to deliver the level care described i n residents' care plans.

an administrator, nurse, and a social worker although the nurse and social worker frequently were part-time contract employees in smaller facilities.
Under Oregon statute, nurses have the capacity to delegate care tasks.
In North Carolina, the Intergovernmental Health Policy Project (IHPP) has identified a particular interest in staffing.
New regulations in that state require that a study of the fiscal impact of all residential facilities be conducted to measure the effects of staff size, staff turnover ratios , wages and benefits, and staff training (Folkemer, IHPP, 1995, p. 23).
5.
Emerging Issues and Concerns a.
Staffing Ratios Are Becoming More Common
Although there is general acceptance of the standard of "adequate" staffing patterns a s described above, Mollica et al. insist that the trend in state policy is moving away from such vague prescriptions.
The authors insist that while "a few states require ra tios of awake or on-site staff,...the clear trend substitutes flexible staffing plans and schedules for specific staffing ratios" (Mollica et al. p. 22). b. Staffing Patterns Specific to Dementia Patients
One example of the trend toward specialization is in the area of assisted living for dementia patients.
In a summary of a recently published draft report titled "People With Dementia: Toward Appropriate Regulation of Assisted Living and Residential Care Settings," Joan Hyde proposes that "there sha ll be adequate staff to meet the personal care and activity needs of the residents a s documented in their service plans.
The facility shall maintain written staffing schedules and actual hours worked by each employee shall be documented" (New Report Offers Draft Regulations fo r Assisted Living for People with Dementia, ALFAA Advisor , July 1995, 1-2).
The Hyde proposal on the standard that there should be "adequate" numbers of staff awake and on the premises 24-hours a day to me et both scheduled and unscheduled needs and to ensure the safety of the residents , does not include specific ratio goals for an assisted living facility.
The draft report insists that "a facility that holds itself out to be particularly equipped to meet the needs of people with dementia or which operates a specialized dementia unit shall make public its staffi ng patterns.
These shall include, at a minimum, 24-hour awake staff."
Like the genera l standards, Hyde expects the staff working with dementia patients shall keep written records of the actual hours that they have worked to ensure that consumers are receiving the services promised by the facility.
Additional standards specifically designed for facilities housing dementia patients are also outlined by Pfeiffer (Postgraduate Medicine , January 1995). c. Nurse Delegation
Mollica et al. also specifically addresses the question of nursing needs in assisted livin g facilities.
They conclude that there is currently a significant movem ent nationwide away from the use of nurses for medication administration and inj ections.
This trend toward "nurse delegation" reflects concerns about cost effectiveness and the fact that many tasks traditi onally performed by nurses can be safely p erformed by nurses aides and other non-licensed employees.
The Mollica et al . assessment of nurse delegation is borne out by the research findings of Hawes et al. (1995).
They found that 73 percent of staff in Board and Ca re homes who reported passing medications were not licensed nurses and 28 percent of staff in Board and Care homes who reported giving injection s we re not licensed nurses.
They further found that 26 percent of the non-nursing staff passin g 95SW00026
3-28
Lewin-VHI, Inc.
medications reported that they received no training on medication supervision or management, and only one state (Oregon) has a program to train and certify nursing assistants to pass medications (Hawes et al., 1995, p. 18). d.
The Role of Geriatric Social Workers
In addition to the concern for adequately trained care staff, some experts in the field o f geriatric social work have raised questions about the mental health and social work needs o f assisted living residents.
Some industry experts have argued for an expanded role for geriatri c social workers in the assisted living setting.
They insist that geriatric social workers have special skills that are needed to assist the frail elderly in navigating the gray area between preserving their independence and conceding to the need for assistance in ADL's.
Conflicts may arise betwee n housing managers and social workers over the often overlapping roles that they assume in assisted living fac ilities, and these disputes must be resolved so that the residents receive the benefits o f appropriately trained staff.
e. Exploring The Relationship Between Staff and Quality
In a survey of 16 developers, Kane and Wilson (1992) id entified three general staffing issues related to quality: 1) the supply and turnover of assisted living staff, who generally receive low pay; 2) training staff for the assisted living model; and 3) the relationship of staff to quality.
No empirical studies have been undertaken since 1992 to evaluate the impact of different staffing patterns o r employment arrangements on assisted living.
However, such evaluations have been undertake n in the nursing home industry.
This research has found that increased numbers of RNs in particular, but also increased numbers of all types of staff, lead to better quality outcomes in the nursing home setting.
In addition, anecdotal reports allege staffing deficiencies in reference to several recen t accidental deaths at assisted living facilities.
Former employees of Sunrise Retirement Homes 
One former RN at the Falls Church Sunrise facility indicated that "they (the facility administrators) made the families feel that their loved ones would be watched over and that staff could take care of emergencies, which was not true" (Washington Post , September 18, 1995).
In a October 1995 press release, Sunrise insists that its staffing problems have been blown out of proportion, and that identified problems have been ameliorated.
Specifically, Sunrise state s that it has developed additional training programs for staff at the facilities wher e problems have been reported.
In addition, Sunrise states it has begun staffing a full-time nurse at all facilities this year.
Assisted living facilities staffing problems are also one result of the fact that their work force is largely under-educated and paid a wage that reflects their relatively low level of skills and training (Washington Post , January 9, 1995).
For example, Sunrise reportedly pays its employees $6 to $9 per hour.
Yet, Sunrise and other assisted living providers q uestion the extent to which they are really responsible for medical supervision.
Sunrise senior management has argued with the media that assisted living should not be held to the same standards as skilled nursing facilities wher e medication management and a concentration on precise record keeping is the norm. f. Elder Abuse
The potential for elder abuse also has been a growing concern for experts in geriatric social work.
Watson, Cesario, Ziemba, and McGovern (1993) have conducted research on abuse i n 95SW00026
3-29
Lewin-VHI, Inc.
institut ional settings using Long-Term Care Ombudsman abuse reports and found that abuse , although an important problem, was relatively rare in both the nursing home and residential car e setting, and that the incidence of abuse was lower in residential care settings than in nursing homes (.008 per bed per year for the residential care setting compared to .03 per bed per year for nursing homes).
Conc ern about abuse and the vulnerability of the frail elderly in all types of group an d institutional settings seems to have prompted the State of Washington to take some preventative measur es. Wolcott (1994) reports that a new law in the State of Washington requires crimina l background checks on all long-term care facilities and that the law applies to employees in assisted living facilities.
According to the Intergovernmental Health P olicy Project, some other states are now following suit.

THE EFFECTIVENESS
CHAPTER IV AND COSTS
OF
ASSISTED LIVING
This chapter focuses on the effectiveness and cos ts of assisted living.
A number of industry experts have asserted in the recent literature that the elderly prefer assisted living over nursin g homes, that a ssisted living can result in more positive outcomes for the frail elderly, and tha t assisted living is a less expensive alternative to nursing homes.
After a brief summary of what the 1992 Policy Synthesis found about the effectiveness of assisted living and its costs, this chapte r discusses th e current "conventional wisdom" regarding the value of assisted living as a senior s health and housing opportunity, and notes the general absence of research on costs.

EFFECTIVENESS
AND
COSTS
OF
While man y industry observers believe that assisted living is a more desirable livin g environment than nursing facilities, the 1992 Policy Synthesis found that there was little direc t empirical evidence that the frail elderly prefer assisted living to nursing homes.
There is an absence of research on the topic, but some studies support the conclusion that the frail elderly prefer to stay in their own home or reside in congregate living facilities rather than live in nursing homes.
Such findings may reasonably be generalized to assisted living.
Alth ough some researchers suggest that the elderly living in assisted living facilities ar e happier than nursing home residents and that their caregivers exhibit higher levels of satisfaction, the 1992 Policy Synthesis found limited research suggesting t hat either assertion was generally true.
Empirical evidence supporting the strongly-held conventional wisdom that assisted living residents avoid institutional placement is very weak and is generally grounded in anecdotal information.
The res earch on health and functioning outcomes, while preliminary and limited in scope, does offe r some substantiation of the claim of improved health outcomes for assisted living residents.
The 1992 Pol icy Synthesis found that there was clear evidence of cost savings whe n assisted living substituted for nursing home care, but found no evidence that assisted living would reduce the aggregate system-wide costs related to caring for the frail elderly.

EFFECTIVENESS
OF
ASSISTED LIVING
Relatively little current literature has been written on the subject of the "effectiveness" o f assisted living with respect to producing desired outcomes.
One empirical study has bee n completed on the psychological well-being of residents of congregate living settings, and anothe r has addressed CCRC residents' health care utilization.
However, major outcomes studies of th e effectiveness of assisted living have yet to be produced.
1.
Psychological Outcomes Research
One recently published study reports results on the psychological well-being and relocation adjustment for the frail elderly moving to a congregate living setting.
No known studies have been conducted that compare residents of congregate settings to nursing home residents.
In a study of 4-1
95SW00026
Lewin-VHI, Inc.
seniors moving to a rural congregate setting, researchers examined the factors influencing relocation adjustment with a sample of 50 residents aged over 60 without cognitive impairment or "debilitating health problems" (Armer, 1993).
The vast majority of seniors in the sample perceived their move to a congregate setting as positive (92 percent) and 66 percent reported being satisfied with their new residence.
Having had a choice in relocating and the re location setting, and a combined choice fa ctor, all were positively and significantly correlated to scores on both the Philadelphia Geriatri c Center Moral Scale and the Index of Relocation Adjustment.
Predictability of the setting, the social support and the challenge of the relocation were all associ ated with higher scores on the adjustment scale.
Since the subjects in the sample were not cognitively i mpaired and had no "debilitating health problems," it may not be appropriate to generalize these results to all residents of assisted living.
2.
Impacts on Health Care Utilization
In two separate studies, Newcomer et al. examined the relationship of residence in a CCRC to health care utilization.
In the first study, they investigated health care utilization of CCR C residents compared to a matched sample of community residents.
Researchers found that when us ing a multivariate model to control for age, living arrangement, gender, disability, and type o f residence (community or CCRC), CCRC residents were significantly more likely to use SNFs an d have more nursing visits compared to community residents.
CCRC residents also were less likely than commu nity residents to use hospitals and more likely to use physician visits and outpatien t surgery.
Being a CCRC resident was the strongest predictor of SNF stays and nursing visits.
This stu dy confirmed previous research that found skilled nursing utilization higher among CCR C residents at the same time that it found that 40 to 50 percent of the nursing home admissions were for post-hospital or recovery from outpatient surgery.
The researchers conclude that there is a su bstitution effect between personal care in CCRCs and nursing services (Newcomer 
In a second study, Newcomer et al. examined lif etime utilization of assisted living and skilled nursing beds for residents in seven CCRCs, excluding short-term stays in either the assisted living or skilled nursing beds.
Researchers found that assisted living was a substitute for skilled nursing beds, although they cautioned that in consideration of the other variables in their model, this effect was "modest" (Newcomer et al., 1995).
These and other recent research efforts support the hypothesis that assisted living residents use more skilled nursing care than community residents, and provide empirical support for assisted living advocates' assertions that assisted living can provide a less expensive alternative to skilled nursing care.
Recent research also appears to support the view that assisted living residents may be using the health care system in a new, more flexible way by using personal care in the CCRC to substitute for skilled nursing.
Fewer hospital inpatient visits but more outpatient surgery, combined with either skilled nursing care or personal care in the CCRC, may indicate a change in utilization.

CURRENT LITERATURE REGARDING T
HE
COSTS
OF
ASSISTED LIVING
This section of the literature review update focuses on systems of pricing assisted living as well as the actual costs to the consumer.
Mollica et al. cite a Kane study that concluded that the general variation in long-term care costs among states was due to differences in staffing standards rather than to variations in wage levels and real estate costs in different regions (Mollica et al., p. 37).
These and other variations will be discussed in this chapter.
1.
Pricing Systems
A number of systems of pricing assisted living are in effect around the country.
One industry observer maintains that pricing is evolving and ranges from a fixed monthly fee system to an a la carte pricing system.
"This a la carte pricing flexibility typically takes one of two approaches.
One approach involves approximately $4 to $6.50 a day for each 15 minutes of assistance in daily living provided.
The alternative involves defining levels of assistance on a case management analysis" (Moore, 1993, p. 78).
Th e recent work of Mollica et al. represents an even more comprehensive examination o f pricing systems nationwide.
Their report indicates that all of the states use either a daily or monthly capitated rate for publicly subsidized residents.
Private pay residents are charged on the basis of either a flat, fixed fee or an a la care cost structure.
Oregon, Arizona, Ohio, and North Dakota all have tiered cost structures which reimburse providers based on the type and degree of ADL needs of the residents.
Massachusetts, Texas, and Washington all use flat rates.
New York, Minnesota, and Wisconsin have modeled their reimbursement rates on their case-mix system for reimbursing nursing homes (Mollica et al., 1995, pp. 18-19).
It has been estimated that 90 percent of assisted living residents are private paying (Nichols, January 1995, p. 60).
2.
Pricin g Systems for Low-Income Residents: Security Income (SSI) Medicaid and Supplementa l
For low-income assisted living residents, costs are reimbursed jointly by Medicaid and SSI. Medicaid pays for health care costs, while SSI pays for the housing portion of assisted living.
The SSI payment is designed to pay all room and board costs, which include real estate, raw food and food service costs.
Residents with incomes below $458 per month would be eligible for Medicaid, and some states may offer a Special Income Level (SIL) option.
SIL allows a state to set eligibility at up to 300 percent of the federal SSI payment, or $1374 a month i n 1995.
For those residents who do not qualify for Medicaid due to other income, states can offer an SIL eligibility standard through a Medicaid 2176 waiver or they may establish a state supplement to the federal SSI payment.
The SIL allows residents with incomes above the Medica id eligibility level to use their own income to pay the rent in an assisted living facility (as long as the facility does not receive rent subsidies) and to use the Medicaid SIL funds to pay for the service portion.
The state SSI supplement option helps those who do not have enough income to pay their rent, while preserving their Medicaid eligibility.
A wide range of costs exists for the assisted living consumer, depending on a number o f factors.
These factors include whether the facility is a CCRC, requires an entrance fee, is a rental congregate setting, the unit is private or semi-private, the size of the unit, the age of the facility, and the services provided and covered in the basic fee.
A summary of the prices mentioned in th e literature is provided in Exhibit 4.1.

Overall Cost Effectiveness
Mollica et al. (1995) report that assisted living has become an increasingly valuable option in the seniors housing market.
State policymakers interviewed for the NASHP report indicated that assisted living has reduced reliance on nursing homes and has offered residents a more home-like environment in which to "age-in-place" (Mollica et al., 1995, p. 42).
Specifically, Mollica et al. report that assisted living costs between 50 percent and 80 percent of nursing home costs in many states.
The authors caution that assisted living is probably more expensive than home health care because services are needed seven days a week.
However, they explain that for those persons for whom services are needed seven days a week in their home, that setting might not be the most appropriate given the strain on caregivers.
4.
Cost Projections
Industry observers have also indicated that policymakers will have to address a number of questions regarding the future of costs and effectiveness in the assisted living industry.
Thes e includ e: will assisted living reduce spending on nursing homes? Some argue that the pattern o f nursing home spending will depend on how states respond to increasing d emand for seniors housing as the population ages and lives longer.
Some states are said to ignore this trend and maintain a fixed supply of all long-term care services.
Finally, for those states that do recognize the trend and expand supply of long-term care services, it is as yet unclear whether t he growth will occur in nursing homes, community or home health care, or residential options like assisted living (Mollica et al., p. 56).

Documenting cost savings in assisted living is difficult.
Projections about future use (th e costs of care and the types of services that wil l be needed by the frail elderly) can only be estimated with current information and data.
However, one empiric al study does report that assisted living has reduced nursing home costs in the state of Oregon.
A reduction in the supply of nursing home beds and a concomitant increase in assisted living and other residential service options have caused a decline in nursing home occupancy in Oregon.
Occupancy has dropped to 83 percent at the same time that supply has dropped.
These combined forces have reduced aggregate costs (Mollica et al., 95SW00026

Lewin-VHI, Inc.
1995, p. 56).
In addition, a report on the Massachusetts Medica id program projected annual savings in net state costs of $2398 per participant in assisted living (as compared to their five-year costs in a nursing home) (Mollica et al., p. 74).

CHAPTER V IN REGULATING ASSISTED LIVING
As background, this chapter begins with relevant inf ormation regarding public regulation with respect to residential facilities other than assisted living.
An overview of the state-level regulatory activity regarding assisted living and a discussion of the forces driving increased regulation are also provided in this chapter.
Finally, we include several examples of mo del regulations being considered and we report on the progress being made toward industry-led accreditation.
A.
REGULATORY ACTIVITIES/OTHER T ELDERLY 1.
Board and Care
YPES OF
RESIDENTIAL FACILITIES FOR
THE
FRAIL
Board and care is a category of residential hous ing that includes assisted living (under many current state definitions).
Recently, board and care has been the subject of an extensive study of the impact of regulation on quality outcomes (Hawes et al., 1995).
A key finding of this study is that states with extensive (and enforced) regulations had homes with "better q uality," variously measured.
Howe ver, the authors found that the presence of regulations did not necessarily decrease th e number of unlicensed board and care homes.
Moreover, well-developed regulatory systems were not associated with more hours of staff training, more cleanliness, or less institutional character to a facility.
2.
Developments in State Regulations Regarding Resident Needs and Nursin g Related Services: "High Level Residential Care Facilities" (1990-1993)
In 1990 and in 1993, the Intergovernmental Health Policy Project (IHPP ) collected information from the s tates regarding licensed facilities that met three principal requirements: (1) they serv e primarily the elderly and care for a minimum of three resident s; (2) they are not nursing facilities; and (3) they provide health services and licensed nurse supervision as part of residential care or are the leve l of licensed residential care providing the most extensive personal care support service s available in the state (Lipson, 1994).
The results of the surveys indicated that between 1991 and 1993, a substantial number of states were either adding a new level of care or modifying existing regulations to expand th e admissi on criteria and/or add provisions regarding health-related services such as medicatio n administration.
As can be seen in Exhibit 5.1, derived from the IHPP report, about one-third of the states were reported to be changing their licensing rules and nearly one-quarter were considering policy changes, frequently related to assisting living.

REGULATORY ACTIVITY REGARDING ASSISTED LIVING EMERGING FROM 1.
Defining Assisted Living in State Policy
THE
STATES
Mollica et al. include an appendix in their NASHP report which lists the 18 states that have formal ly defined assisted living in order to categorize assisted living within a specific regulator y fr amework.
However, these definitions vary significantly, both in their level of detail and in thei r focus.
Like the definitions found in the trade l iterature, state policymakers either emphasize the role of assisted living as a supportive housing option or as a health care option for the frail elderly.
A publication of AAHSA has explained the definitional pro blems inherent in state regulation of assisted living.
Some states may define an assisted living facility (and thus, regulate it according to pertinent laws) as an adult residential care facility, while others might define it as either a home for the aged, a personal care home, or an assisted living facility (Currents , May 1995).
These varying definitions crea te a confusing regulatory environment, and probably cause problems for assisted livin g operators who own facilities in several states.
2.
Overview of State Regulatory Policy: What is Driving Increased Regulation? a.
State Regulatory Bodies and their Methods of Enforcement
In June, 1995, the AARP published an overview of assisted living regulatory issues.
Thi s policy brief explains that in most states Departments of Health or S ocial Services license and inspect as sisted living facilities, usually following regulations for board and care, residential care, o r domiciliary care.
Enforcement of these standards is reportedly lax and few sanctions are eve r imposed on facilities not meeting these standards.
In addition, the sanctions are weak because few housing alternatives exist for low-income residents should their residence be closed.
The AARP policy brief argues that one explanation for the weak, unenforced regulations is a lack of consensus among the states regarding a model for assisted living.
(We will discuss in the next section what models do exist.)
Without a model and without any federal guidelines, state laws vary consid erably with respect to services provided, admission and discharge criteria, and othe r issues.
Recent reports of accidental deaths at several Sunrise assisted living facilities have raised the question of enhanced state oversight of assisted living in Maryland and Virginia.
The IHPP report on 1994 state legislative changes in chronic care specifically name d assisted living as the residential care setting that is re ceiving the most attention nationally.
Because it is a care option that is designed around individualized service and "managed risk," states se e assisted living as a potentially cost-effective and preferred residential setting for many frail elderly who would otherwise be inappropriately admitted to a nursing facility.
b. Increased Regulation
In the findings of the NASHP report, Mollica et al. explain the conflict inherent in federal and state policy that results from the dichotomy drawn between the services and service provider s involved wit h the frail elderly and the physical site where services are provided.
The confusio n created by this distinction is compounded by the funding problems facing low-income elderl y persons.
Chapter Four's discussion of eligibility requirements for SSI and Medicaid demonstrates the complex ity of multi-policy involvement in assisted living.
As Mollica et al. argue, "thes e incongruities highlight the contradictions of many regulatory policies and provide a sound basis for re-examining how states license, regulate, and finance long-term care for their citizens" (Mollica et al., p. 4).
95SW00026
5-3
Lewin-VHI, Inc.
Mollica et al. cite a number of reasons for the recent legislative activity around the issue of assisted living.
First, as state policymakers watch residents in board and care settings grow (as a population) older and frailer, they are amending regulations to allow for a higher level of servic e provision in those settings in order to prevent an explosion of demand for more expensive nursing home beds.
In addition, the NAHSP report explains the signifi cance of the aging-in-place argument in the development of new state policy.
A number of states have adopted assisted living policies in order to allow older residents in subsidized housing to remain in one facility and receive higher levels of service.
A third reason for the increase in legislation is the concern that for some residents, the level of ADL need is more than their families or other caregivers can accommodate, but far less than is standard in a nursing home facility.
Moreover, the home-like atmosphere of assisted living ha s appea led to many who support the creation of alternatives to institutional environments.
Thus , policymakers have encouraged the development of assisted living for those who fall somewhere in between independent living and nursing home-eligibility.
3.
Recent Specific Policy Changes Made By State Legislatures
Base d on the NASHP interviews and analyses of the states' regulations and legislation , Mollica et al . report that 22 states either have legislation authorizing assisted living, a licensur e category for assisted living, or an assisted living service program.
The authors explain that industry representatives, like assisted living owners and developers, have played a key role in th e develo pment of the task forces and other bodies that have helped to create new assisted livin g legislation.
Just as the report went to print, Maine and Utah finalized their regulations.
The report also indicated that authorization legislation was pending in Idaho, Iowa, North Carolina, an d Wisco nsin.
Task forces in Illinois, Louisiana, Michigan, Oklahoma, and Vermont are working t o develop assisted living policies, and the state of Indiana has completed its study of assisted living.
Legislation failed to pass in Montana, and that repeal or modification legislation passed in Florida (modification legislation), New York (repeal legislation), and Ohio (repeal and substitute a service program for a licensure category).
Despite these modifications and repeals, Mollica et al. conclude that the trend toward development of assisted living residential options will continue in the future.
Exhibit 5.2 lists the status of legislative activity in each state.
The regulations vary widely because of a number of key differences in state governance protocols and state laws.
Definitions of assisted living, as stated before, differ widely.
In addition, the types of financing mechanism s use d and the degree of low- and moderate-income targeting are different.
Finally, the reason fo r creating assisted living is varied among states (Mollica et al., pp. 91-92).
Hawes et al. hav e identified additional sources of regulatory difference among the states.
These issues include: 1) licensing standards that vary in terms of admission and discharge criter ia, staffing ratios and training, residents' rights, etc.; 2) inspection procedures that vary in the frequency of facility inspection, the notificat ion procedure for inspection, and the level of inspector team training; 3) the range o f "enforcement remedies" that are used; and 4) the res ources available to supplement the federal SSI payment (Hawes et al., 1995, p. 23).
4.
Key Regulatory Issues a.
Living Unit Requirements
Mollica et al. argue that perhaps the most contentious issue in state regulation of assisted living is the question of living unit requirements.
A number of states require apartment settings in 95SW00026
5-4
Lewin-VHI, Inc.
order to ensure that the units are consistent with the goal of achieving a home-like environment in assisted living.
The 1995 Guide to Assist ed Living and State Policy focuses on regulations as they pert ain to the definition of assisted living, requirements for the living unit, admissions criteria , services provided, medication, and staffing.
Other literature produced recently (Clemmer, Bianculli, Fitzgerland and others) provides additional detail and informs the reader of issues around certificate of need (CON) and the implications of other legislative changes on assisted living facilities.
b. Managed Risk
Certainly one of the most significant emerging regulatory issues is the concept of "managed risk."
While the regulation of risk is not directly un der the purview of state policy-makers (it is a legal issue akin to durable power of attorney assignment), the expansion of this practice may becom e increasingly important for policymakers to consider as they begin to more extensively regulate the physical plant and care service provision of assisted living facilities.
In a very concise explanation of the concept of managed risk, Mollica et al. argue that "assisted living represents a new attempt to build long-term care services on a set of principles that gives more st atus to individual preferences and control rather than safety" (Mollica et al., p. 58).

Many experts in the industry foresee a conflict between the goals of regulators to protect the frail elderly, and the interests of the elderly themselves who seek to retain some level o f independence through managed risk contracts with assisted living operators.
The recent criticism of Sunrise, for example, demonstrates that the states of Maryland and Virginia are experiencing such a conflict.
While the two states appear to be responding with greater oversight of assisted living, they may have to address the arguments made by Sunrise management and the caregivers o f Sunrise residents who cite the facilities' appreciation of the assisted living philosophy as the key to optimal quality of life for residents.
The conundrum around risk is well illustrated in the opinion of one industry observer, "our ideas about risk in this country are changing.
Risk is a moving target in this country right now" (Elizabeth Clemmer as quoted by The Washington Post , January 9, 1995). c. Certificate of Need (CON) Laws
One of the most intriguing issues in assisted living, and in fact in the entire residential care arena, is the impact of Certificate of Need (CON) laws.
In one article, an assisted living developer cited the absence of CON as a significant source of financial strain on his company because such laws ofte n limit the competition in particular market areas.
As this developer explained, "there i s cu rrently no requirement in Florida that a certificate of need or other approval need be obtaine d before new facilities can be constructed or existing ones expanded.
Unlike the construction of new home s, which require such regulatory determination, there are few barriers to entry into the adul t assisted living business.
The ease of entry could cause an over supply of facilities which could result in low occupancy levels and price cutting" ( Tampa Bay Business Journal , April 28, 1995, p.3).

d.
The Implications of the Americans With Disabilities Act (ADA) and th e Fair Housing Amendments Act (FHAA)
As the 1992 Policy Synthesis anticipated, indirect l egal and policy issues have had important implications for the assisted living industry, one of those being the implementation of the Americans With Disab ilities Act (ADA).
One recent article explores the impact of ADA provisions on th e operat ions of assisted living facilities.
While the ADA is a federal law, its provisions have bee n widely litigated in state courts.
As one industry observer explains, "recent court decisions indicate that ADA does not supersede state licensure regulations restricting assisted living facilities fro m admitting residents with specified disabilities" (Bianculli, Provider , January 1995, p. 38).
In addition, the ADA ma y not require an assisted living facility to apply for broader licensure status t o accommodate the needs of a resident with a disability.
However, because the ADA was designed to protect people with disabilities from discrimination, the law is fairly strict in its requirement that a facility have a very high standard of proof to justify a restriction on a resident with a disability.
The ADA does prohibit any restriction on a resident's participation in a facilities programs, unless th e restriction is the only way that the facility can appropriately respond to the resident's disability.
As this article concludes, "accommodating less-able residents clearly poses significant operational and resident relations issues."
In addition to the ADA, federal amendments made to the Fair Housing Act in the 1980' s pot entially impact the development of assisted living facilities.
Certain portions of the FHAA ma y serve to limit certain local regulations when those laws impinge on the rights of the disabled t o equivalent housing (note that the law does not ensure "equal" housing) opportunities.
The federal government, through the Department of Justice, has committed itself to defend the rights of th e disabled in cases of discriminatory zoning and fire codes, which sometimes take the form o f "protective" legislation, put forth in local ordinances.
Those defending the cause of managed risk in the assisted living environment may ultimately conflict with supporters of protective legislation.
e. Medicaid Waiver Issues
Anot her central issue in regulatory policy concerns Medicaid waivers.
Some industr y observers have suggested, using the state of Oregon as an example, that waivers are associated with greater regulation of assisted living.
One recent article explores the implications of expanded Medicaid waiver opportunities on assisted living facilities in terms of the potential for greate r oversight and regulation (Fitzgerald, 1995).
Oregon, which has used Medicaid waivers mor e extensively than any other state, is reportedly also the most strict in its regulation and oversight of assisted living.
Industry leaders in Oregon, Minnesota, and Florida have indicated that states will continue to use regulations of assisted living as a way to contain Medicaid costs as waivers make assisted living a viable option for a large number of low-income frail elderly persons for the first time (Fitzgerald, 1995).
Another recent article on the links between Medicaid reimbursement and state regulation of the assisted living industry suggests that reimbursement req uirements make it imperative that states tighten up their regulations for assisted living (Pallarito, 1995).
This article also refers to a recent Massachusetts law (not included in either the IHPP or Mollic a reports because it was signed into law in 1995) which links the use of SSI for assisted living with a very strict set of regulations for assisted living facilities.
The new Massachusetts law requires state review of all assisted living facilities on a bi-annual basis, establishes certain facility standards, and confirms resident rights.
In addition, the law requires that assisted living operators provide proof of their "fiscal soundness."
Of all of the literat ure written recently on the subject of regulation, only this article suggests a link betwee n increased regulation and positive quality outcomes.

MODEL REGULATIONS 1.
AND
ACCREDITATION
No National Regulatory Model Exists
Model regulat ions per se have not yet appeared in the literature on assisted living.
It i s notable that major provider organizations (AHCA, AAHSA, ALFAA) associated with assisted living have not developed or officially endorsed formal , comprehensive model regulations.
However, draft reports of possible regulatory models have emerged, and regulatory and licensure standards in a number of states may serve as models for other states considering the development or th e expansion of assisted living facilities.
For example, ALFAA has developed a model for its members to follow, ASHA has developed a general outline of standards, the Institute of Medicine is reviewing wh ether it should develop a certification process for assisted living, and the AARP ha s commissioned a paper with proposed model standards (Mollica et al., p. 59).
2.
Potential Model Regulations
In July of 1995, ALFAA's publication, ALFAA Ad visor announced the forthcoming publication of a report titled, "Draft Regulations for Assisted Living for People With Dementia."
This report , summarized in great detail in the periodical, is the first-ever of its kind, and represents a benchmark against which future regulations might well be judged.
Joann Hyde, th e gerontologist who developed the regulations, argues that special concern for the needs of dementia patients is critical, given that they repre sent 30 to 40 percent of people living in assisted living facilities.
Areas subject t o regulation in Hyde's report include: 1) an extensive definition of assisted living; 2) licensure , registration, or certification; 3) financial support for low income residents; 4) admission and transfer criteria; 5) resident rights, risk, and autonomy; 6) medication management; 7) staff ratios an d patterns; 8) staff ratios and staffing patterns for special care units; and 9) building codes and lif e safety.
The 1995 Guide to Assisted Living and State Policy and the AARP policy brief also examine the possibility of model regulations.
The rather strict regulatory policies of the state of Oregon and other states who have implemented similar changes in assisted living regulations serve as models for other st ates just embarking on their own regulatory adventures.
In a recent meeting of th e Technica l Advisory Panel for the National Study of Assisted Living, participants noted that man y states appeared to be formulating their own regulations by drawing from other states' rules.
"Model regulations" can provide potential alternatives, but few models are readily or completely transferable to every state.
The American Seniors Housing Association (ASHA) model regulations require certain basic services (e.g., personal care up to all ADLs) and prohibit other services (e.g., continuous nursin g care def ined as 24-hour nursing supervision and continued monitoring of vital signs and healt h status).
The American Association of Homes and Services f or the Aged (AAHSA) has not published model regulations, but has included "examples of outcome-oriented regulatory guidelines," related to the physical characteristics of facilities in a workbo ok for developers.
The workbook also includes a state-by-state inventory of physical plant requirements for assisted living (HCFA Review, 1993).
The AARP, in collaboration with several industry experts, will introduce a set of mode l regulations in 1996 which should add an additional voice to the growing number of those interested in the regulation of assisted living.
3.
Accreditation: An Alternative to or a Participant in State Regulation?
95SW00026
5-10
Lewin-VHI, Inc.
With the prospect of increased state oversight and regulation of assisted living on th e horizon, many industry leaders are beginning to advocate for some sort of self-regulation through an organi zed accreditation process.
Some believe that the industry can avoid "undesirable " licensure rules if it can regulate itself and raise all facilities to a common standard.
Others disagree and argue that state regulation is inevitable.
These experts insist that the assisted living industry must prepare to "meet or beat" regulatory standards.
If they can exceed state regulator y expectations early on, they believe that the industry c an avoid a serious financial setback at the time that the regulations are implemented.
One recent article on this topic was published in Assisted Living To day by ALFAA's Secretary (Doyle, Spring, 1995).
Echoing the sentiments of the second group discussed above, Doyle argues, "I believe w e need to develop an accreditation standard that promotes quality operations withou t st ifling new operational and development approaches.
If we do not promote and insist on qualit y operations in assisted living, the federal or state gove rnments will mandate standards for us."
Doyle lists a number of potential benefits of accreditation, including: 1.

Consumers will have more choice; they will be able to discern quality more easily.
Lenders will be able to more readily recognize facilities to which they feel comfortabl e lending.
Managed care providers will have comfort in providing reimbursement for residents residing in accredited facilities.
Long-term care insurance providers will be better able to differentiate good providers.
The accreditation process should make regulators feel comfortable that the industry i s proactively setting a standard for quality operations.
Accreditation could be the catalyst to bring together many national organizations in a very productive and collaborative manner.

CHAPTER VI FINANCING
This chapter focuses on issues regarding financing of assisted living.
In the first part of the chapter, we present a brief synopsis of the discussion of financing programs that appeared in the 1992 Policy Synthesis.
In the following sections we present information on new public , public/private, and private initiatives reviewed in the literature.
A.
PUBLIC FINANCING PROGRAMS
AND ISSUES
DISCUSSED IN T
HE
1992 POLICY SYNTHESIS
As the 1992 Policy Synthesis indicated, public payment programs played a limited role i n financing the development of assisted living for the frail elderly, but over the past several decades a variety of programs to support housing with services have been developed.
Three major trends have occurr ed with regard to financing.
First, over time, public resources were shifted fro m producing new housing units to increasing support for rental assistance in existing housing.
In the late 1960 s, a congressional committee saw the country's primary housing problem as the lack o f adequate housing for low-income families.
The c ommission proposed a major housing construction and rehabi litation program to consist of six million units for low-income families.
A Reaga n commis sion in the 1980s found that the quality of housing had steadily improved due to earlie r investments in new housing.
The commission considered the new problem to be the lack o f af fordability of housing that was readily available and recommended cuts to the numbers of ne w units funded.
Because housing assistance is provided through multi-year contracts, the impact of these cuts is just being felt in the early 1990's (U.S. Code Congressional and Administrative News, 1991).
A second major trend in the housing industry, as evidenced by new programs authorized by the National Affordable Housing Act of 1990 and the earlier Con gregate Housing Services programs, invol ves efforts to combine the financing of development and construction with the financing o f services.
These programs have largely been in the domain of the De partment of Housing and Urban Development (HUD).
HUD has considered human services to be in the domain of other agencies and has traditionally avoided responsibility for even small supportive services programs (Tilson , 1990; U.S. Code Congressional and Administrative News, 1991).
The third trend, demonstrated by the new HOME initiatives, is for Congress to encourag e partnerships between the federal government and states.1 These partnerships would develop such that the federal government will set broader policy direction and will rely on states to develo p solutions tailored to their local needs.
In the next section, public financing programs used for assisted living are briefly introduced.

Incentives For Other Investors to Fund Units Federal incentives designed to generate investments in low-income housing by othe r inv estors are federal mortgage insurance, tax-exempt bonds, and, more recently, low income ta x credits.
These incentives are available to both the for-profit and non-profit sectors.
2.
Federal Programs that Can Promote Assisted Living by Pay ing Rental Subsidies Directly to Low-Income Households
In addition to providing project-based housing assistance, the federal government provides rental subsidies directly to households.
These subsidies are in the form of rental certificates which are limited to the difference between 30 percent of the tenants income and fair market rent as set by HUD, and, more recently, rental vouchers which, unlike rental certificates, allow tenants to pay any excess between 30 percent of income and fair market rents out-of-pocket.
Housing vouchers are intended to provide tenants with more flexibility in their choice of housing arrangements.
3.
Traditio nal Sources of Federal/State Funding that Can Be Used to Provid e Services In Housing for the Elderly
Traditio nal sources which have been used to finance services in elderly housing includ e Medicare, Medicaid, Social Services Block Grants, the Older Americans Act, and the Supplemental Security Income Program.
Medicare and Medicaid, in particula r, largely have been limited to funding medical models of care in institutional settings.
4.
Options for Financing Additional Home and Community-Based Services i n Assis ted Living Settings Under Medicaid Waivers and New Optional Service s Provisions
Some long-term care experts have voiced concerns that the availability of Medicaid to pay for nursing home care and the limited public funds for community-ba sed care creates a "bias" toward institutionalization.
Partly in response to those concerns, Cong ress amended the Social Security Act (which governs state options under Medicaid) to expand states' ability to pay for home an d community care.
The federal government has authorized a selective e xpansion of Medicaid services to the frail elderly in the community under Medicaid Home and Community Based Service Waivers (HCBS).
5.
Federal Programs Designed to Integrate Financing for Housing and Services
A major criticism of policies for funding assisted living is that, historically, disparate funding sources for housing and services have created a fragmented delivery system that does not optimally address the needs of the frail elderly.
Recently, m ore coordinated programs (albeit limited in scope) hav e been developed to begin to address these concerns.
One of the earlier programs was th e congregate housing services program; more recently, the National Affordable Housing Act of 1990 has generated combined housing/services initiatives as well.
6.
Additional Ways In Which States Finance Assisted Living
States rely on a variety of sources to finance assisted living that include: state genera l revenue appropriations, state-levied fees or trust funds, and state general obligation bonds.
The 1993 State of the Senior Housing Industry Report (Gamzon, 1993), a survey of 2 7 95SW00026
6-2
Lewin-VHI, Inc.
individuals reputed to be leaders in the proprietary and nonprofit sectors of the retirement housing industry indicates that industry panelists thought that "principal public expenditures and regulatory actions...will be initiated primarily on the state and local government levels" (Gamzon, 1993, p. 31).
These panelists maintain that the state and local emphasis will be on demonstration projects rather than sweeping funding initiatives.
B.
NEW PUBLIC INITIATIVES 1.
Medicaid Waiver Programs
As one result of the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act (OBRA) of 1981, Congres s established a waiver program through Section 1915(c) of the Social Security Act to offer state s alternatives to traditional long-term care services.
In the past several years, a number of additional waivers have been offered through various provisions, like the Older Americans Act and OBRA 1987 and 1991.
The more recent waivers went beyond fu nding case management, homemaker services, adult day care, and personal services, to offer fund ing for program design as a means of developing cost-effective alternatives for delivering long-term care services.
As of May, 1995, 14 states had federal waivers permitting Medicaid funding of services in assisted living.
At this writing (February, 1996), bills restructuring Medicaid and passed by both the House and Senate eliminate the need for states to obtain federal permission (through a waiver) to use Medicaid money in assisted living.
2.
FHA Mortgage Insurance
Several other noteworthy public initiatives have been discussed in the recent literature .
Effective December 1994, HUD regulations are amended by Section 511 of the Housing an d Community Development Act of 1992 to authorize mortgage insurance for assisted living facilities and to expand existing regulations to include refinanc ing of conventional assisted living facilities and to insure additions to these facilities (Federal Register, 11/29/94).
A definition of assisted livin g facilities also was published with the announcement (see definitions in Exhibit 2.1).
Occupancy by more than one person without the express consent of all is prohibited and funding must be sufficient to ensure that the facility contains dwelling units and facilities for the provision of supportive services.
In the area of financing the construction of new facilities, the 1992 Housing Act extende d Section 232 of the Federal Housing Administration's (FHA) mortgage insurance program to include assisted living facilities.
As the AARP policy brief has observed, "the availability of mortgag e ins urance for assisted living should make reliable financing easier to obtain, thereby reducin g financing costs.
The resulting savings can enable developers to make assisted living more available to persons with lower incomes" (Clemmer, AARP Policy Brief , 1995, p. 11).
Before the change to Section 232 was made, the HUD program was available only to skilled nursing, intermediate care, and board and care facilities.
In addition, the new rules provides fo r improvements to the loan application process.
Loans underwritten pursuant to Section 223(f) are now eligible for a streamlined application process.
An article written in Provider (February 1995) explains that the FHA guarantee backing the Section 232 program will ensure that facilitie s participating in the program will be rated as some o f the most creditworthy.
The article explains that "projects may be funded with either conventional or publicly sold debt at the most advantageou s rates, and not-for-profit owners may be able to access tax-exempt funding."
Assuming that certain shortages are covered by FHA, ratings as high as "AAA" coul d be achieved by participating facilities.
Industry observers have concluded that the extensions to Section 232 in addition to its centra l 95SW00026
6-3
Lewin-VHI, Inc.
components (a 35-year amortization schedule for acquisition an d refinancing of existing facilities and up to 40 years for substantial rehabilitation of existing facilities) make the program an excellen t financing option for assisted living developers (Olson, 1995).
Assisted Living Today (Winter, 1995), reports that in addition to the AAA rating possibilities, the new program includes: Refinance/purchase loan-to-value ratios of up to 85 percent for for-profit owners and up to 90 percent for not-for-profit owners Debt service coverage ratios as low as 117 percent for for-profit borrowers and 111 percent for not-for-profit borrowers The ability to fund additions and improvements as part of a purchase or refinance without a full scale renovation of the facility as was formerly required.
In order to facilitate the use of the new Section 232 mortgage in surance program, it has been reported that HUD held interactive distance learning sessions with its field offices in August 1995.
HUD officials reportedly wanted to convey to state representatives that the new source of funding could be used to advance funds during project c onstruction.
It was also reported in recent literature that HUD plans to hold additional training through "distance learning" regarding assisted living in the next year.
HUD has also recommended the use of "empowerment zones" in the development o f assisted living facilities.
These zones, of which there are over 100 designated around the country, are slot ted to receive as much as $100 million plus tax incentives for businesses to locate withi n their boundaries.
ALFAA included an article in one of its more recent publications that suggested the use of empowerment zones by assisted living developers.
3.
Other Publicly-Funded Programs
Financing for construction and mortgage costs is also available through tax-exempt bonds, and depending on the model, HUD's 202 and Congregate Housing Services Programs (Mollica et al., p. 55).
HUD's 202 program is partially funding service coordinators to act as case managers, i.e., to link residents with needed services from the communit y.
In addition, the 202 program is used as a funding source for service coordinators to act as case managers, linking residents with needed services from the community.
4.
Recent State Policy Changes Regarding Assisted Living Financing
Mollica et al. report the most recent state policy changes in the NASHP study.
A summary table of the findings of that report can be found in Exhibit 6.1 These state summaries reflect a growing interest in Medicaid waiver programs as a way to finance assisted living for low-incom e residents.
Only a few states (Connecticut, Hawaii, and Wyomi ng) have mentioned development and construction loan incentives in recent legislation, according to Mollica et al.

Financing Policy Other than SSI, no public financing is available for assisted living.
W hen the recently passed regulations are implemented, rates will be adjusted to reflect the level of care and regional variations across the state.
Rates have been negotiated with each project within guidelines specified in the Medicaid waiver.
Program ad ministrators used rates set for adult foster care, nursing facilities, the Oregon assi sted living program and the Arizona HCBS program as guidelines.
Thre e classes of rates are negotiated based on the level of care.
The SSI payment is $446 per mon th of which $391.10 is paid to the residence to cover room and board charges an d $66/90 is retained by the resident.
The He alth and Education Facilities Authority provides loans for the development o f assisted living facilities.
No specific program exists to subsidize services for low-income residents of assisted living.
$2.3 million was approved in 1994 for 220 Medicai d HCBS waiver slots as a pilot program.
The SSI benefit is $586 per month.
The program reimburses the facility $750 per month for service s for a total payment of $1336 (a personal allowance is subtracted from thi s sum).
To be eligible for the pilot program, recipien ts must be a SSI recipient, have income under 300% of the federal SSI benefit or, for elderly and disabled applicants, hav e incomes under 90% of the federal poverty level.
Sta te loans and bonds would be made available at favorable interest rates to stimulat e develo pment of assisted living.
An HCBS waiver program is currently being considered.
A Medicaid waiver is being considered.
Eligible low-income residents may be subsidized through state general funds, based on a sliding scale.
The state subsidy is capped at $550 per month in non-waiver facilities.
Participan ts pay the difference between the state subsidy and the monthly fee.
Th e month ly fee is capped at $1200 for residents eligible for the GSAH Medicaid waiver .
These residents pay 20% of the monthly fee for room and board.
Loans are provided by the Massachusetts Housing Finance Agency and th e Massachusetts Industrial Finance Agency for the construction of assisted living projects.
A supplement to the feder al SSI payment would set the rate at $920 per month for single individuals in assisted living.
Under the HCBS waiver, rates for a ssisted living services are capped at the state share of the aver age nursing home payment and the total costs cannot exceed 100% of th e average cost for the resident's case mix classification.
New financing options for low-income residents are being considered.
Subsidies are available for M edicaid recipients.
The service reimbursement is set at 50% of the res ident's Resource Utilization Group (RUG) which would have been paid in a nursing home.
A task force re port has recommended that the Division of Medical Assistance investigate the use of funds to reimburse for personal care and th at the allowance either be increased or that personal care supplies be included in the standard rate.
The state has four sources of financing: an HCBS wa iver for the aged, blind, and disabled, an HCBS waiver for people with traumatic brain injuries, and two state-funded programs-a service pay ment for elderly and disabled and the exceptional service payment for th e elderly and disabled.
The programs pay providers a rate based on the resident's car e needs.
The maximum payment is $50 per day.

Wisconsin Wyoming
Source: Adapted from Mollica et al., NASHP, 1995.
Ot her sources have also commented on specific state policy changes regarding assiste d living financing in Ohio, Texas, and Massachusetts.
The state of Ohio has established a set-aside fund that has been collecting a daily one dollar surcharge on private pay nursing home residents, and that reportedly will be used to subsidiz e assisted living residency for low income frail elderly without informal caregiver support if Senate Bill 192 passes (Kemper, 1994).
Texas has obtained a Medicaid waiver for 22,000 slots that will be used to place eligible frail elderly in assisted living facilities (Bowe, 1993).
The Massachusetts Department of Public Welfare has applied for approval to supplement federal SSI payments to eligible individuals living in assisted living facilities (Rajecki, 1993).
Assisted Living Today (Winter, 1994) reports that the Massachusetts Housing Finance Agency' s ElderCHOICE program is able to issue both tax-exempt and taxable bonds for assisted living facility construction.
The Group Adult Foster Care Program fun ds services for assisted living residents and Massachusett s can use this funding to "offset the cost of services for low income elders whe n underwriting a loan" (Assisted Living Today , Winter, 1994, p. 26).
C.
PRIVATE/PUBLIC INITIATIVES
The recent literature refers to a few private/public initiatives in assisted living that ar e targeted to providing assisted living to low income frail elderly.
One article proposes specifi c private/pub lic collaboration ideas that can minimize costs and also provides several examples o f facilities that have been developed through collaborative ventures.
A second article provides two examples of private/public collaboration.
One observer argues that the future of assisted living's ability to provide housing for seniors with low or moderate income levels is dependent on the industry's innovation.

Create a 501(c)(3) joint venture organization to qualify for real est ate tax exemption and other benefits; Raise community donations, combine these funds with donate d land to qualify for community development block grants, and other grants; Leverage private donations, land, and grant funds to qualify for tax-exempt financing; Negotiate low-cost developer and architect fees; and Design facilities frugally, have smaller units and conservative common areas.
Several examples of public/private collaboration exist.
One example is a municipality that has used tax-exempt bonds to construct a low-income assisted living facility; the county housin g authority operates the facility.
Another facility built by a for-profit developer uses community-based services to keep operating costs lower.
A 501(c) (3) used church d onated land and community fundraising to obtain a state grant; the assets were leveraged to generate tax-exempt bond revenue .
Qualified residents in this latter facility are funded by state personnel and congregate car e reimbursement and special demonstration project funds (Frymier, 1993).
Woodside Place and Rosewood Estate are two examples of public/private collaborations in assisted living.
Woodside Place in Oakmont, Pennsylvania, has leveraged grants and contributions fro m public foundations to obtain funding from tax-exempt bonds in a collaboration between th e Presbyterian Association on Aging and Western Pennsylvania Hospital.
The sliding-fee arrangement provides for higher-income residents to subsidize lower-income residents (Hamilton, 1992) .
Rosewood Estate in Roseville, Minnesota, has used HUD 221 funding (that no longer is available) and provision of home health services through a partnership "among residents, family, friends, and staff" keeping the costs of formal services minimal.
An on-site home health agency bills services in 15-minute increments at $5 per increment, keeping costs of services low.
Residents only pay for services used (Hamilton, 1992).

PRIVATE INITIATIVES The Assisted Living Industry Is Seen As An Increasingly Attractive Investment Opportunity
While assisted living has historically had some difficulty attracting private investment, many industry leaders now believe that this trend is changing.
One article reported that over the next five years, billions of dollars will be required to satisfy the assisted living industry's capital demand s (Pallarito, 1995).
As AAHSA argues, financing options will increase as the lending community becomes more educated and comfortable in financing assisted living facilities ( Currents , May 1995).
The anticipa tion of greater investment community involvement in the development of assisted livin g projects appears to be borne out in the recent literature.
According to a survey of more than 250 capital lenders across the country, lenders are becoming increasingly interested in the financia l needs of long-term care facility developers.
The survey, conducted by Cambridge Realty Capital Ltd. of Chicago, found that lenders have already allo cated larger amount of funds toward the health care sector in 1995.
Specific areas of interest for those health care funds include the long-term care and 6-7
95SW00026
Lewin-VHI, Inc.
senio r housing sectors.
As a result of their findings, the survey researchers anticipate increase d capital for senior housing over the next 24 months.
With regard to specific financing preferences, the survey results (published in the ALFAA Advisor, June 1995) found that: Fixed or flo ating rate mortgages were cited most.
This is the favored approach o f commercial banks, HUD, Wall Street, insurance companies, pension funds and credi t companies.
The sales/leaseback format is the favorite approach of REITs and private investors.
Thi s method allows for ownership of real estate without operating responsibility, taking on a n equity-oriented structure.
Construction loan/mini-perm loans work well for commercial banks and, to a lesser extent, for REITs and for HUD, which offers the most popular format.
Industry leaders have been coordinating their efforts recently so that they might better attract members of the investment community to finance the development of assisted living facilities.
One tool t hat has been developed is a model financial feasibility study, produced by AAHSA.
Th e guidelines produced through a joint project with Ernst and Young and KPMG Peat Marwic k represents the first attempt to establish generally accepted guidelin es for preparing a comprehensive financial and market feasibility study for an assisted living facility.
The standards cover all of th e majo r components of development, including the project description, proposed financing, an d analysis of market demand.
2.
Criteria Used By Investors To Evaluate Assisted Living Facilities
Listed briefly, the three major qualifications for investor interest in an assisted living facility are "experience, education, and equity," according to Assisted Living Today (Winter, 1994, p. 24).
Members of the long-term care investment community interviewed for th at article support those three criteria and they provide clarification on all points.
Experience in this case means the experience of the operator, the credit of the operator, the develop ment team qualifications as a whole, and market acceptance as demonstrated by a reasonable historic market penetration rate in the assisted living industry.
Education involves a successful marketing strategy for both the investors and the potential market.
The marketability of the proposed project, its service pr ogram and concept, the architectural design and site characteristics, the quality and mai ntenance of the facility, demographic information, and t he ability of the facility to compete in the marketplace are all issues which the facilit y owner/opera tor must "sell" to the investors.
As a representative of the Massachusetts Housin g Authority has said: "developers and operators must be able to articulate their objective or mission, identi fy an appropriate and sufficient target market, demonstrate the ability to implement a n appropriate program of services, and design a building which supports the desires and needs of its frail res idents while minimizing construction and operating costs ( Assisted Living Today , Winter, 1994, p. 27).
Finally, with respect to Equity , it is reported that investors like to see debt service coverage of at least 1.15.
In addition, at least one of the interviewed investment sources requires lease-up reserves, as well as letters of credit for the construction and operating periods.

3.
Barriers to Private Financing
One representative of a financing company has argued that the most significant barrier for the financing of assisted living is the absence of CON laws in many states.
Without CON, assisted living facilities face much greater competition than nursing homes, which may be perceived b y investors as a better risk (Assisted Living Tod ay, Winter, 1994, p. 27).
In addition, other investment experts have suggested that the assisted living industry needs to educate the investment community better about the growth potential of the industry and of the demogr aphic trends that indicate a steady population for assisted living facilities.
Moreover, the industry is viewed as management-intense and subject to intense regulation in the near future, two things that serve to further alienate investors.
Finally, some lenders are wary of the seniors housing industry in general, due to a large number of loan defaults in the 1980's by poorly qualified developers ( Assisted Living Today , Winter, 1994, p. 27).
4.
Private Financing Innovations
Joint ventures in the development of assisted living have become more common recently.
One article reviewed the relationship between Karrington Communities (a well-established assisted living developer) and the Sisters of Charity Health Care System, Inc.
The collaboration and th e unique governance structure of the joint venture are used as examples of the opportunities available for cooperative schemes in the assisted living industry.
As one partne r was quoted as saying, "these types of collaborative ventures should be more prevalent in the assisted living industry" ( Assisted Living Today , Spring, 1995, pp. 13-14).
5.
Public Offering
An additional strategy being used by some assisted living companies is the option of going public.
Several articles actively followed the initial public offering (IPO) and subsequent publi c offering s of Assisted Living Concepts, Inc. and the Standish Care Company and there has bee n much speculation as to whether other assisted living companies will follow suit.
At ALFAA's Spring 1995 conference, public offerings were the topic of one of the panel sessions.
Capital investment opportunities were cited as the largest benefits of public offerings.
SEC oversight of financia l records and a ctivities was cited as the most significant disadvantage, along with the great ris k involved in a public offering.
6.
The Future of Private Financing: Which Types of Investors Will Be Interested in Assisted Living in the Future?
Most respondents to the Assisted Living Today financing survey agreed that selected real estate investment trusts (REITs), commercial finance companies, commu nity banks and savings and loans will provid e most of the capital for assisted living facilities in the next five years.
As th e industry expands and secures its market niche, commercial banks and insurance companies ar e expected to join the aforementioned in the financing of new assisted living projects ( Assisted Living Today , Winter, 1994, p. 28).
REITs are expected to be most involved in financing loans fo r construction and permanent financing to some of the larger multi-home assisted living companies.
Commu nity and regional banks, on the other hand, will play a larger role in financing stand-alon e facilities.
The larger banks will be involved in construction/mini-perm projects and will seek takeout financing opportunities (Assisted Living Today , Winter, 1994, p. 29).

EMERGING ISSUES
AND
CONCERNS REGARDING FINANCING
Some industry experts expressed concern in recent literature that for-profit assisted livin g facilities serving largely private pay residents are not paying close enough attention to their financial health.
In particular, these articles focused on debt burdens of senior housing facilities.
Recently published benchmarks for assisted living facilities appear in the AAHSA publication, "Financial Ratios and Trend Analysis of CCAC's," AAHSA's "Operational Practices in Assisted Living," and ASHA's "State of Senior Housing 1994" report.
Proposed c hanges to HUD housing programs also attracted the attention of Mollica et al .
The authors argue that initial reports regarding the forthcoming legislation suggests that states will be offered greater flexibility in financing the housing p ortion of assisted living.
However, the benefits of this flexibility may be tempered, Mollica et al. suggest, if fund ing levels are not commensurate with the current demand for assisted living housing (Mollica et al., v.).
Finally, the impact on the development of assisted living for lower income residents o f changes to M edicaid is unpredictable at this point.
Some predict that reduced federal matchin g fun ds combined with fewer federal prescriptions regarding payments to nursing facilities (i.e. , possible elimination of the Boren Amendment) will encourage states to shift Medicaid money to the assisted living sector.
Others see the potential for states restricting scarce Medicaid dollars to the sickest of those dependent on state funds, who are more likely to be in nursing homes.
