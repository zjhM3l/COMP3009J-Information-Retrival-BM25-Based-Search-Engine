Summary of the Kodiak Archipelago Bear Conservation and Management Plan Stable or increasing Kodiak bear populations provide opportunities for multiple recreational experiences throughout the Kodiak archipelago, including on the Kodiak National Wildlife Refuge (KNWR).
Through existing and creative management practices, these activities can be compatible and nonexclusive.
However, opportunities for using Kodiak bears are not unlimited, and the cumulative effects of too many people using the resource can reduce those opportunities for all.
Although Kodiak bears are recognized as a valuable resource to the community, they are also sometimes viewed as competitors and predators by cattlemen and commercial fishermen; as nuisances to anglers and deer hunters; and as potential threats to human life.
The history of how people and bears have lived together on the Kodiak archipelago is a reflection of local, national, and international influences and attitudes.
This history also highlights the fact that, with understanding and tolerance, people can coexist with a healthy population of the world's largest bears.
The best available scientific information indicates that, although the Kodiak bear population is being sustained at a healthy level, human pressures on the bears and their habitat have increased in the last 100 years throughout the Kodiak archipelago.
Road construction, clearcut logging, cattle ranching, and commercial, residential, recreational, and industrial developments are altering bear habitat.
Meanwhile, increasing human activity in bear country is leading to escalating bear-human interactions through hunting, fishing, viewing, and other forms of wildland recreation.
Such interactions may result in the displacement of bears or, in the worst case, in defense of life or property (DLP) bear mortalities.
The purchase of lands and conservation easements from private and public entities within KNWR and in other strategic locations across the Kodiak archipelago was a dominant habitatprotection activity during the 1990s.
Funding for these efforts was derived from civil and criminal settlements associated with the Exxon Valdez oil spill, from the Land and Water Conservation Fund, and from private organizations, principally the Kodiak Brown Bear Trust and The Conservation Fund.
By 2000, nearly 290,000 acres of valuable wildlife habitat on the refuge and more than 100,000 acres of habitat for the Alaska State Park System on Shuyak and Afognak islands had been purchased.
These purchases from willing sellers provided additional management of key habitats, provided public access, and reduced the potential of habitat infringement through developments in remote areas.
Opportunities for habitat acquisition remain and should be pursued.
Private and public resource managers have taken a number of positive measures to address concerns about Kodiak bears and their habitat.
In 2000, the Alaska Department of Fish and Game (ADF

Summary
Kodiak Archipelago Bear Conservation and Management Plan
Such a plan was needed because of increased demand for diverse recreational opportunities and the need to minimize negative bear-human interactions.
Those who live, work, and recreate in proximity to these bears needed to come together and produce a management plan reflecting current research in bear biology, habitat, and behavior while recognizing both traditional and contemporary uses of the resource.
The purpose of the plan is to recommend measures to help ensure the sustainability of the Kodiak bear population, to respond to the public's desire for uses of this wildlife resource, and to address public safety concerns.
Although the population of bears on the Kodiak archipelago is presently healthy and its habitat generally well protected, no management plan had been formalized in the past.
Because management of the bears and their habitat is a shared responsibility of ADF
Other government agenciesÂ­local, state, and federalÂ­also needed to be involved in and committed to the plan's development if it was to be implemented.
The public's involvement with, in fact its ownership of, the plan was considered crucial to the planning process.
The final management plan needed to reflect the public's desires and concerns for continued use of and coexistence with bears if it was to have credibility and validity.
Thus, a combination of public involvement and government commitment were the keys to the success of developing a bearmanagement plan for the Kodiak archipelago.
(The public process designed for development of the plan is detailed in chapter 1, "Introduction.")
Recognizing responsibility for quality resource management justifies development and prompt implementation of a Kodiak bear-management plan.
The healthy status of the Kodiak bear population is quite phenomenal when compared to most brown or grizzly bears elsewhere in the world.
Many have been driven to extinction (California and Great Plains grizzlies), are listed as threatened (Rocky Mountain West), seriously depleted (parts of Russian Far East), or are of growing scientific concern to the extent that hunting seasons have been closed (British Columbia).
Only in the remoter parts of Alaska, northern Canada, and Russia do healthy populations remain.
Kodiak bears have among the highest population densities.
Achieving this plan's proactive goals will ensure the health of the Kodiak bear population into perpetuity.
To provide background information so that the Citizens Advisory Committee (CAC) could make recommendations for the conservation and management of Kodiak archipelago bears, the chapters of this plan, each of which covers a different subject area, include introductory text information to provide bases for the recommendations that follow the issues (and that are also collected and placed in chapter 9, "Recommendations").
To set the stage, chapter 2 deals with the biology, history, and management of Kodiak bears prior to January 2001, when this plan began to be developed.
Kodiak bears live throughout most of the Kodiak archipelago and use virtually all available habitats from the coast to alpine regions.
The archipelago is considered high-quality bear habitat, containing ample food, water, cover, and space.
While vegetation is a prominent part of the bears' diet, salmon is the most important source of protein for most Kodiak bears.
Currently, the human population and related human development have had minimal impacts on bear habitat.

Kodiak Archipelago Bear Conservation and Management Plan
Summary
Potential threats include seasonal human use of inland and coastal areas, future developments (e.g., road and energy development) and related problems (e.g., oil spills) and natural occurrences (e.g., reduction in salmon stocks).
Kodiak bears are adaptable.
Bear habitat and bear-human relationship are intimately intertwined; if people are not willing to make an effort to live around bears, large expanses of wilderness areas where people rarely go are necessary for sustainable bear populations.
With this information in mind, the CAC makes a number of recommendations to protect bear habitat on the archipelago.
These recommendations cover the following subject areas: land use, acquisition, and planning; activities on Afognak Island; minimizing habitat degradation; road building in bear habitat; motorized access; bear-use areas; human activities in bear habitat; introduced species; and salmon as a part of bear habitat.
Residents and visitors harvest a variety of fish, wildlife, and plant resources on the Kodiak archipelago, and all of these harvest activities are interrelated with bears.
Management of the harvest of Kodiak bears is currently based primarily on population assessments and regulation of sport hunting.
With a healthy population of bears on the archipelago, the emphasis has been on maintaining a stable bear population that will sustain an annual harvest of 150 bears, composed of at least 60 percent males.
Subsistence harvest of bears is presently managed by the U.S. Fish 
Subsistence hunting permits are allocated each year with one in Akhiok, one in Karluk, three in Larsen Bay, two in Old Harbor, two in Ouzinkie, and two in Port Lions.
Sport hunting of bears in Game Management Unit 8 (Kodiak archipelago) is regulated by a complex system involving drawing hunts and registration hunts.
Nonresident bear hunters are required to use a guide; big-game hunting services provide significant economic resources to the people living on the archipelago.
Other resource extraction, including deer hunting, elk hunting, commercial fishing, sport fishing, and harvest of berries and other plants, also directly impacts bear populations.
The CAC makes recommendations on a number of harvest issues, including the following: management of bear-harvest activities, subsistence use of bears, sport hunting, guiding, other resource-extraction activities, and regulations and their enforcement.
Management objectives for bears on the Kodiak archipelago currently are based on harvest figures.
ADF
At present, the total bear population on the Kodiak archipelago is stable and can be sustained at this high level by the natural habitat.
Habitat in different areas is capable of sustaining different bear densities.
Although the entire Kodiak archipelago is high-quality bear habitat, there are areas where human development and residence take precedence.
Thus, biological carrying capacity and wildlife-acceptance capacity may be different.
With this awareness, the CAC recommends a shift to managing the bear population by density rather than by harvest alone.
To do this, biologists need accurate data on bear populations and habitat carrying capacities.
The CAC also recommends reducing, through liberalized sport hunting seasons in the spring and issuance of appropriate depredation permits, the bear population along the road system of northeastern Kodiak Island by 10-20 percent below the current estimated level.

Summary
Kodiak Archipelago Bear Conservation and Management Plan
There are a variety of situations in which bears and humans interact: killing of bears in defense of life or property; solid-waste management and storage of human and pet food; livestock ranching; bear-viewing activities; public-use and remote cabins in bear habitat; other recreational activities in bear habitat, etc.
The CAC thoroughly discussed the issues involving bear-human interactions and made recommendations that can have a significant impact on the future management of Kodiak bears.
Kodiak bears have been the subjects of formal research for the past 60 years.
Initial research centered on bear-cattle and bear-salmon conflicts.
By the 1960s, research activities evolved into a more holistic approach, looking into feeding habits, reproductive potential, growth rates, movements, and population estimations.
In the 1980s and 1990s, research expanded to include most of the representative habitats on Kodiak Island.
Routine monitoring, based on research results and harvest reports, allows biologists to track and manage human impacts on bears.
New research will fill information gaps and will be needed to address increasing and changing demands for the Kodiak bear resource.
The CAC recommends that ADF
The first priority should be continued monitoring of the harvest and population trends in established survey areas.
The CAC recommends that a variety of monitoring and research activities be continued or initiated.
The CAC believes that the widespread dissemination of accurate, fact-based information concerning Kodiak bears is essential for conserving bears and their habitat on the Kodiak archipelago.
The primary objectives of current Kodiak bear-education efforts are to reduce negative bear-human interactions and to increase appreciation for and understanding of bears and their habitat.
The CAC examined a number of ways to enhance the current educational effort by establishing educational programs that provide accurate information resulting in continued conservation and management of Kodiak bears.
The key to any educational effort is cooperation and commitment by all concerned to provide science-based, accurate information in order to cultivate a well-informed public.
Those who live, work, and recreate on the Kodiak archipelago need clear and useful information about bears in order to build understanding of bear behavior and to minimize negative bear-human interactions.
In addition, with understanding and preparation, people can avoid bear encounters and respond wisely when they do occur.
The CAC makes recommendations on the development and dissemination of educational and public outreach materials.
These recommendations regard the following subjects: general user education, hunter education, off-road vehicle user education, angler education, U.S. Coast Guard education, economic incentives and land management, village and rural residents, and funding for education efforts.
All the recommendations made by the CAC on all subjects are compiled in chapter 9, "Recommendations," with cross-references to the specific chapter (and, thus, subject matter and background information) from which they evolved.
A series of appendices affords the reader with definitions of abbreviations, acronyms, and terms used in this document as well as more specific information regarding certain subjects.

Introduction Kodiak--The name conjures up images of mystery, grandeur, and power.
An integral part of that mystique is the Kodiak bear (Ursus arctos middendorffi).
Kodiak bears are valued locally and worldwide as a symbol of what is great about Alaska's indigenous wildlife.
Kodiak bears generate income for the tourism industry, hunting and viewing guides, wildlife photographers, and many other businesses.
Further, stable or increasing bear populations provide multiple recreational opportunities throughout the Kodiak archipelago, including on the Kodiak National Wildlife Refuge (KNWR).
It is assumed that, through existing and creative management practices, these activities can be managed compatibly and nonexclusively.
However, opportunities for using Kodiak bears are not unlimited, and the cumulative effects of too many people using the resource can reduce those opportunities for all.
Above all, there is a desire as well as a need to ensure that Kodiak bears will be available for future generations to use and enjoy.
Although Kodiak bears are recognized as a valuable resource to the community, they are also sometimes viewed as competitors and predators by some cattlemen and commercial fishermen; as nuisances to anglers and deer hunters; and as potential threats to human safety or life.
The history of how people and bears have lived together on the Kodiak archipelago is a reflection of local, national, and international influences and attitudes.
This history also highlights the fact that, with understanding and tolerance, people can coexist with a healthy population of the world's largest bears.
1.1 The Reason for a Management Plan
Although the best available scientific information indicates the Kodiak bear population is being sustained at a healthy level, human pressures on bears and their habitat, throughout the Kodiak archipelago, have increased in the last 100 years.
Road construction; clearcut logging; livestock ranching; and commercial, residential, recreational, and industrial developments are altering bear habitat.
Meanwhile, increasing human activity in bear country is leading to increasing bear-human interaction through hunting, fishing, viewing, and other forms of wildland recreation.
Such interactions may result in the displacement of bears or, in some cases, in bear mortality in defense of life or property (DLP).
The purchase of lands and conservation easements from private and public entities within KNWR and in other strategic locations across the Kodiak archipelago was a dominant habitatprotection activity during the 1990s.
Funding for these efforts was derived from civil and criminal settlements associated with the Exxon Valdez oil spill, from the Land and Water Conservation Fund, and from private organizations, principally the Kodiak Brown Bear Trust and The Conservation Fund.
By 2000, nearly 290,000 acres of valuable wildlife habitat on the refuge and more than 100,000 acres of habitat for the Alaska State Park System on Shuyak and Afognak islands had been purchased.
These purchases from willing sellers provided additional management of key habitats, provided public access, and reduced the potential of habitat infringement through developments in remote areas.
Opportunities for habitat acquisition continue to exist and should be pursued.

Introduction
Kodiak Archipelago Bear Conservation and Management Plan
Private and public resource managers have taken a number of positive measures to address these concerns about Kodiak bears and their habitat.
In 2000, the Alaska Department of Fish and Game (ADF
Those who live, work, and recreate in proximity to these bears came together and produced this management plan, which reflects current research in bear biology, habitat, and behavior while recognizing both traditional and contemporary uses of the resource.
The purpose of this plan is to recommend measures to help ensure the sustainability of the Kodiak bear population, to respond to the public's desire for uses of this wildlife resource, and to address public safety concerns.
Although the population of bears on the Kodiak archipelago is presently healthy and its habitat generally well protected, a management plan had not previously been formalized.
Because management of bears and their habitat is a shared responsibility of ADF
Other government agencies--local, state, and federal--also were involved in and committed to the plan's development and to ensuring that it be fully implemented.
The public's involvement with, in fact its ownership of, the plan was considered crucial to the planning process; such a plan needs to reflect the public's desires and concerns for continued use of and coexistence with bears if it is to have credibility and validity.
(The public process designed for development of this plan is detailed in section 1.4.)
Recognizing a responsibility for quality resource management justifies development and prompt implementation of a Kodiak bear-management plan.
The healthy status of the Kodiak bear population is quite phenomenal when compared to most brown or grizzly bears elsewhere in the world.
Many have been driven to extinction (California and Great Plains grizzlies), are listed as threatened (Rocky Mountain West), are seriously depleted (parts of Russian Far East), or are of growing scientific concern to the extent that hunting seasons have been closed (British Columbia).
Only in the remoter parts of Alaska, northern Canada, and Russia do healthy populations remain.
None of these bears in other populations, however, can compare in physical size to the Kodiak bears, which have among the highest population densities.
Achieving this plan's proactive goals will ensure the health of the Kodiak bear population into perpetuity.
1.2 Goals of this Plan
The Kodiak Archipelago Bear Conservation and Management Plan is intended to provide to the resource- and land-management agencies guidance regarding planning and regulatory decisions for Kodiak bears (see section 1.4.2).
It is intended to be a dynamic document that allows for reasonable flexibility in management and thus is subject to change in ensuing years.
In developing this plan, the Citizens Advisory Committee (CAC) (see section 1.4.1) recognized the need to build on the successful ADF

Introduction
Â· Â· Â· Â· Â·
address social, economic, and cultural concerns regarding bears and bear management ensure that a healthy and secure population of bears is maintained throughout the Kodiak archipelago ensure that important bear habitat is protected mitigate potential conflicts among interest and user groups ensure the continuation of opportunities for public use and enjoyment of Kodiak bears and their wildland habitats on the Kodiak archipelago
Although the recommendations made by the CAC and included in this plan are based on scientific information provided by qualified wildlife biologists, the plan itself is not intended as a scientific report and does not adhere to conventional scientific reporting styles, citations, and the like.
The recommendations included in this plan are intended to be consistent with state and federal laws, rules, and regulations.
In cases where this is not so, the CAC has recommended appropriate changes to state or federal laws, rules, and regulations, which would have to be promulgated by the appropriate state or federal agencies through standard planning, review, and management processes.
In some instances, recommendations made by the CAC will entail increased agency capabilities, such as staffing, funding, or enforcement.
Finding the means of meeting these increased needs will be part of the implementation strategies developed by the Intergovernmental Planning Group (IPG) (see section 1.4.2).
This plan recognizes and honors all terms of conservation easements negotiated with Native land owners.
Recommendations in this plan incorporate respect for private property rights while recognizing that private land owners have responsibilities to adhere to applicable laws in the conservation of bears and their habitat.
1.3 Background
Many factors influence the development of a management plan for bears on the Kodiak archipelago: the geography and climate, the wildlife, and the people who live, work, and play there.
1.3.1 The Kodiak Archipelago
One of the primary reasons for the success of the Kodiak bear population is the quality of the habitat on which it depends (see also chapter 3, "Kodiak Bear Habitat").
A major reason the Kodiak archipelago supports one of the highest density of bears in the world is the biological productivity of this ecosystem.
The high density of bears is due in part to the diverse and abundant favored bear foods (including plants, berries, and salmon), the fact that most of the archipelago is undisturbed by permanent human development, and the intensively managed and regulated bear-hunting regime that is in place.

Introduction
Kodiak Archipelago Bear Conservation and Management Plan
The Kodiak archipelago is located in southcentral Alaska, 252 miles southwest of the city of Anchorage.
The archipelago's three main islands (Kodiak, Afognak, and Shuyak) and numerous smaller islands encompass about 5,000 square miles, stretching 150 miles from north to south and 40 miles from east to west (see Figure 1-1).
The archipelago is in a geologic uplift zone, and the present landscape has been sculpted by extensive glacial activity.
Kodiak Island has numerous mountains with elevations greater than 3,000 ft along its central spine, with the highest being Koniag Peak at 4,470 ft.
The southwestern portion of Kodiak Island and neighboring islands have more moderate terrain, and Shuyak Island has only slight relief.
The coastline of the island group is typified by rugged headlands, rock outcroppings, gravel- and boulder-strewn beaches, and intertidal flats.
Deep and narrow bays, with numerous branching arms and islets, are abundant.
The region has a cool, maritime climate characterized by overcast skies, fog, windstorms, and moderate to heavy precipitation.
Summer temperatures average between 50Â° and 60Âº F and seldom exceed 75Âº F. Winter temperatures average in the low 20s (F) and rarely drop below 0Âº F. Precipitation occurs primarily as rain near sea level and as snow at high elevations from October through April.
Annual precipitation varies widely among years and specific sites, but usually ranges from 40 to 80 in.
Consistent winds of 30Â­60 mph are common.
Northern islands of the archipelago, including the northeastern portion of Kodiak Island, are forested with extensive stands of Sitka spruce.
On Kodiak Island, the forest edge is slowly advancing southward.
Large areas of forestland on Afognak and Kodiak islands have been commercially harvested.
A diversity of habitat types occurs throughout the remainder of the archipelago, with shrub-grass-forb complexes predominant throughout lowland (less than 500 ft) and mid-slope (to 1,500 ft) areas.
Representative species are Sitka alder, salmonberry, European red elder, willows, ericaceous shrubs (heath), sedges, bluejoint grass, ferns, fireweed, and cow parsnip.
Cottonwood and willow communities are common along stream bottoms.
Extensive areas of regularly spaced hummocks (1Â­4 ft tall) are abundant on southwestern Kodiak Island.
Vegetation in upland (above 1,500 ft) areas is composed of various mixtures of low willow, heath, sedge, grass, and forbs.
The brown bear is one of six indigenous mammals that inhabit the Kodiak archipelago, the others being red fox, river otter, short-tailed weasel, little brown bat, and tundra vole.
Introduced mammals include Sitka black-tailed deer, Roosevelt elk, mountain goat, reindeer, snowshoe hare, beaver, and red squirrel.
Marine mammals such as harbor seals, Steller sea lions, sea otters, porpoises, and whales are common along the coast.
Some 123 bird species are common on the archipelago, and 114 additional species have visited at one time or another.
The City of Kodiak, on the northeastern corner of Kodiak Island, is one of the nation's major fishing ports.
Five species of Pacific salmon spawn in rivers and streams on the archipelago.
Dolly Varden trout are widely distributed throughout the area, and rainbow trout are found in many watersheds.
Summer salmon fisheries are a main ingredient of a diverse, yearround commercial fishery participated in by residents in every community on the archipelago, a popular sport fishery, and the subsistence lifestyle of a number of archipelago residents.
These salmon also are a mainstay in the diet of most Kodiak bears.

1.3.2
The Archipelago's Residents
The archipelago is also home for about 14,000 people, all residing in coastal areas.
The City of Kodiak and associated road-connected communities include almost 13,000 people, with most of the remainder of the population residing in one of the six villages (see Figure 1-1) on Kodiak Island and nearby Spruce Island.
During the summer, the human population increases dramatically and disperses throughout coastal areas.
Remote cabins and lodges are used in support of commercial fishing and recreational activities.
Human use of inland areas is usually transient, with the exception of Afognak Island where extensive year-round logging has been conducted for the past 25 years.
Kodiak bears contribute to Kodiak's economy by providing hunting, viewing, and other opportunities to enjoy wildlife and recreational pursuits in a natural setting.
Along with Kodiak's commercial and sport fisheries, these activities contribute to every aspect of the area's economy, including tourism, lodging, transportation, and related professions such as guiding, charter boat operations, and air taxi operations.
In fact, most businesses and jobs in Kodiak benefit directly or indirectly from the conservation of Kodiak bears and their habitat.
Bears also are responsible for economic losses to livestock ranchers, campers, and home owners, and bear-human interactions can result in destruction of private property and bear DLP mortality.
Kodiak's balanced ecosystem, of which people are an integral part, forms the baseline from which this management plan was designed.
The plan is not intended to seek remedies for a threatened bear population; rather, it is an analysis of a successful coexistence between people and bears and an attempt to improve on that situation to accommodate shifts in human uses of bears.
It also suggests ways to reduce bear-human conflicts in a mutually beneficial manner in the face of anticipated increases in human activities and related impacts on the archipelago.
1.4 Plan-Development Process
Development of this Kodiak Archipelago Bear Conservation and Management Plan was part of a four-phase process: Â· Â· Â· Â· Qualitative Research through review of background materials and interviews with citizens to better understand the relevant issues Creation of a Citizens Advisory Committee charged with developing a plan for the management of bears on the Kodiak archipelago Public Outreach efforts to involve the general public in review and further development of the management plan Implementation by an intergovernmental planning group charged with implementing the recommendations outlined in the plan

Introduction
1.4.1
Citizens Advisory Committee
To ensure that this plan reflects the experience, needs, and desires of the public concerned with the future of Kodiak bears, the members of the CAC were selected to represent 12 key interests involved with Kodiak bear conservation and management: Â· Â· Â· Â· Â· Â· Â· Â· Â· Â· Â· Â· 1.4.2 agriculturalists and ranchers air taxi operators citizens at large commercial fishing commercial wildlife photographers conservationists guides Native large-land owners Native villages resident sportsmen the Kodiak Brown Bear Trust tourism Intergovernmental Planning Group
Representatives of state, federal, and local agencies having management and regulatory authority came together as the Intergovernmental Planning Group (IPG) to appoint members of the CAC, to develop a charter (see Appendix Q) for the CAC, and to develop and coordinate a strategy for implementing the recommendations of the CAC.
Although final implementation is contingent on the standard policy processes of each agency or entity, IPG members will work together to facilitate the implementation of the recommendations from the Kodiak Archipelago Bear Conservation and Management Plan.
The IPG comprises representatives from the following agencies: Â· Â· Â· Â· Â· Â· Â· Koniag, Inc.

Kodiak National Wildlife Refuge Comprehensive Conservation Plan
One objective of the process was to work with USFWS and help provide extensive citizen input to its planning process on KNWR, which comprises a major portion of Kodiak bear habitat.
At the time ADF
USFWS is cooperating with ADF
Because public acceptance of the plan is critical to its success, those involved with the Kodiak bear-management planning process were committed to an extensive public outreach program.
All CAC meetings were open to the public, with opportunities set aside during working sessions and on some evenings for the public to ask questions and provide input.
CAC members developed avenues of communicating with their constituencies to ensure concerns were addressed in development of the plan.
Information about the plan's development, summaries of CAC meetings, announcements of upcoming CAC and public meetings, and the means for various interest groups to contact CAC members were published on the ADF
Further, a newsletter was published and distributed (as well as posted on the Web site), and information was regularly provided directly to print and broadcast media.
1.4.5 Follow-up on Implementation of Recommendations
The CAC, and members of the public participating in the process, devoted significant time and effort to the creation of this plan.
Although the process for developing this management plan incorporates a means by which the recommendations will be implemented (see section 1.4.2), the CAC recognizes the need for an ongoing team to work with agencies not only to help implement these recommendations, but also to provide input consistent with this plan on issues that may arise in the future regarding Kodiak bears and their habitat.
The intention is to maintain the continuity of the CAC process to work toward consensus among members representing diverse citizen groups and interests.

To that end, the CAC has requested formation of the Kodiak Unified Bear Subcommittee (KUBS), a local group consisting of representatives of a similar mix of public interests as those included in the CAC plus the addition of a single representative for each of the following interests: Â· Â· Â· Â· Kodiak Fish and Game Advisory Committee bear-viewing guides small property/lodge owners sport-fishing guides
KUBS would make recommendations to appropriate government agencies and boards concerning other Kodiak bear conservation and management issues.
KUBS is envisioned as either an independent citizens advisory group that will secure its own funding or as a recognized subcommittee of the Kodiak Fish and Game Advisory Committee.
One of the items that might involve KUBS is working with ADF

Biology, History, and Management of Kodiak Bears 2.1 Biology
Bears on Kodiak have long been recognized as the largest in the world.
An adult male can stand more than 10 ft tall when on his hind legs and 5 ft when on all four legs.
Kodiak bears weigh as much as 1,300 lbs.
Females are about 20 percent smaller and 30 percent lighter than males.
The oldest known wild Kodiak bear was a 35-year old sow.
The oldest boar was 27 yr old.
Cubs are born in the den during January or February.
Weighing less than a pound at birth and with little hair and closed eyes, they suckle for several months, emerging from the den in May or June and weighing 15Â­20 lbs.
Typical litter sizes are two to three cubs, and most cubs stay with their mothers for three years.
More than 25 percent of the cubs die before they leave their mothers, with cannibalism by adult bears (predominantly males) being one of the major causes of death.
Bears that have recently left their mothers have high rates of mortality.
These subadult bears (three to five years of age) are also the ones most likely to come into conflict with people.
Kodiak bears become sexually mature at five years and can continue to produce cubs throughout their lives.
The average interval between litters is about four years.
Mating season is during May and June.
Kodiak bears are serially monogamous (having one partner at a time) and stay together for a couple of days to a couple of weeks during mating.
As soon as the egg is fertilized and divides, it enters a state of suspended animation until autumn when it finally implants on the uterine wall and begins to grow again.
Although Kodiak bears are often referred to as carnivores, they are technically omnivores (using a variety of foods).
They actually spend more time eating grass, plants, and berries than they do eating meat.
Fish are an important part of their diets, but few Kodiak bears expend the time or effort necessary to chase and kill mammals.
Bears use the most nutritious parts of their food to maximize weight gain.
Grass and forbs are only used while bears are rapidly growing in the spring and early summer.
Brains, flesh, and eggs are preferred parts of the salmon.
Internal organs of deer, elk, and cattle are eaten first when one of these animals is killed or scavenged.
Berries are used most often when they are ripe and sugars in the berries are at the highest level.
Kodiak bears begin entering their dens in late October.
Pregnant sows are the first to go to den; males are the last.
Males begin emerging from their dens in early April, while sows with new cubs may stay in dens until late June.
Some males may forego denning, staying active all winter.
Bears do not defend territories, but they do have traditional areas that they use each year (home ranges).
They are naturally diurnal (active during the day), but when faced with competition for food or space, they adopt a more nocturnal (active at night) behavior.
Because of the rich variety of foods available, Kodiak bears have some of the smallest home ranges of any bear population.
Although generally solitary in nature, Kodiak bears often occur in large groups
February 2002

Biology, History, and Management
Kodiak Archipelago Bear Conservation and Management Plan
in areas of concentrated feeding.
Because of this, they have developed a complex language and social structure.
Only one person has been killed by a bear on Kodiak in the past 70 years, and about once each year a bear injures a person.
2.1.1 Kodiak Bear Research
During the past 40 years, biologists have learned much about Kodiak bears.
In the early 1960s, biologists began gathering baseline biological information on bears (Troyer 1962).
As they refined methods of capturing and marking bears (Troyer et al. 1962) and incorporating radio telemetry in 1967 (Berns and Hensel 1972), biologists became more efficient at estimating bear movements and density.
Their studies also provided the first objective data on sex and age ratios (Troyer and Hensel 1969), reproduction (Erickson et al. 1968; Hensel et al. 1969), litter sizes (Troyer and Hensel 1964), behavior (Troyer and Hensel 1964), cannibalism (Troyer and Hensel 1962), dentition (Troyer and Hensel 1969), and denning (Lentfer et al. 1972).
During the 1980s and 1990s, there was another surge of baseline and applied bear research on Kodiak.
Extensive use of radiotelemetry on bears living near Terror Lake (Smith and Van Daele 1990), on southwest Kodiak Island (Barnes 1990), on the Aliulik Peninsula (Barnes and Smith 1997), and on the Spiridon Peninsula revealed denning, feeding, movement, and reproductive history patterns.
Lip tattoos and ear tags were applied to 401 bears between 1982 and 1997 to investigate mortality rates and movements of bears that were not radio-collared (Smith and Van Daele 1990).
Perhaps the most significant result of this massive amount of research was development of an objective method of measuring bear population densities and trends on specific parts of Kodiak Island (Barnes et al. 1988).
2.2 History
Kodiak's geologic character is not conducive to preserving fossil evidence, so there is no way to confirm how long bears have been on the islands.
Kodiak bears have, however, been isolated from other bear populations since the last ice age (about 12,000 years ago) and during that time have developed into a unique subspecies: Ursus arctos middendorffi.
A detailed account of the history of bears on Kodiak can be found in the monograph The History of Bears on the Kodiak Archipelago (VanDaele 2002).
The following historical information is excerpted from that document.
2.2.1 Alutiiq People
Humans first arrived on the islands approximately 7,500Â­8,000 years ago, and paleontologic evidence of Kodiak bears is found in some of the oldest midden sites of these ancient Alutiiq people.
At that time, the Alutiit hunted bears, using their meat for food, hides for clothing and bedding, intestines for rainproof parkas, long bones for tools, and teeth for adornment.
Because of the spiritual relationship between the bear and the Alutiit, skulls were left in the field.
Because it was the only large land mammal on the archipelago available, the bear was an important subsistence food for the Alutiit.
Bears were usually stalked by groups of two or three hunters armed with bows and arrows.
The bear arrow was about 32 in. long and had a barbed bone point 7 in. long with an inserted end blade of slate.
If the bear attacked, the hunters defended themselves with spears.
Archeologists page 2-2 February 2002

Biology, History, and Management
suspect that there were 65 villages and about 8,000 people on the archipelago by the early 1700s (Clark 1968).
Fetishes and other artistic renditions of bears occur in archaeological sites on Kodiak as old as 2,500 years.
Myths and traditional stories about bears are common in all Alaska Native traditions, and those recorded from the Alutiit are similar to stories told by Yup'ik elders in western Alaska and by Alutiiq elders.
The main themes of the myths revolve around the similarity between bears and humans, including the ability of bears to change into people and vice versa, and the mystical nature of bears because of their proximity to the spirit world.
2.2.2 Russian Occupation and American Acquisition
Russia's Bering expedition bypassed Kodiak in 1741, but in 1784, Russians actually landed on the island.
Soon thereafter a flood of independent trappers and Russian entrepreneurs came to the area to capitalize on the abundant fur resources.
Bear hides were considered a "minor fur" and sold for about the same price as river otter pelts ($10 each).
The number of bears harvested increased substantially when sea otter populations declined.
After the United States acquired Alaska as a territory in 1867, bear harvests on Kodiak increased, peaking at as many as 250 bears per year.
When commercial fishing activities increased in the late 1880s, and canneries proliferated throughout the archipelago, bears were viewed as competitors for the salmon resource and were routinely shot when seen on streams or coasts.
2.2.3 First Conservation Efforts
Around the turn of the last century, sportsmen and scientists recognized the Kodiak bear as the largest in the world.
They also voiced their concern that bear populations were overharvested and were suffering the fate of other well-known big game animals around the world.
One of the nation's first conservation organizations to address these concerns was the Boon and Crockett Club; the group lobbied for federal legislation to enforce wildlife regulations.
The Game and Wild Bird Preservation and Disposition Act of 1900, also known as the Lacey Act, set the foundation for the first legal protection of much of America's wildlife, including Kodiak bears.
The bears also benefited from laws designed to protect salmon from increasing harvests, including establishment of the Afognak Island Forest and Fish Culture Reserve in 1892.
2.2.4 Volcanic Eruption
Kodiak's ecosystem changed suddenly and drastically on June 6, 1912, when Mount Katmai (Novarupta) erupted.
A series of three major eruptions blew six cubic miles of the mountain into the air, depositing as much as a foot of ash on Afognak Island and on northern Kodiak Island.
Winds drifted the ash, and rains washed it into lakes, completely filling some lakes that were as deep as five feet.
Residents reported that many animals, including bears, were blinded and made bold by hunger.
Salmon-spawning was seriously impacted; a few salmon, however, were still able to return during the summer and were available for bears.
Vegetation was quick to recover, and the ash was credited with increasing productivity of grass, shrubs, and especially spruce in later years.
While the eruption had a major impact on the bears on the northern islands, it was not detrimental to the entire population.

2.2.5
Harvest Regulations
Professional interest in guided Kodiak bear hunts, and a concern for unregulated resource use in frontier lands such as Alaska, prompted the territorial government's newly established Alaska Game Commission to abolish commercial bear hunting (selling the hides) on the archipelago in 1925.
A limit of three harvested bears per year was established, and, in 1926, bear harvesting was prohibited during the summer months, except for in defense of life or property (DLP).
The new regulations limiting harvest to three bears per hunter applied to the Alutiit as well.
The Commission also required that any nonresident hunter in Alaska be accompanied in the field by a registered big-game guide.
As professional guiding was implemented along with other hunting regulations, many guides became successful because of Native knowledge and experience in guiding.
At about the same time, the commission, in conjunction with local Kodiak sportsmen's groups, took an active role in increasing the diversity of the archipelago's wildlife by importing Sitka black-tailed deer, Roosevelt elk, muskrat, beaver, mountain goats, and snowshoe hares.
In 1932, the commission prohibited bear hunting on Afognak Island, and for the next eight years that island was managed as a bear sanctuary.
2.2.6 Conflicts with Cattle
The impacts of the new regulations seemed to restore bear populations on the Kodiak archipelago.
By the 1930s, ranchers on northeastern Kodiak Island reported an increase in bear problems and demanded action.
The Game Commission sent a biologist and a team of hunters to eliminate problem bears on the ranches in 1939, and seven bears were killed.
In their final report, however, the agents discouraged the idea of further bear-control efforts.
They suggested managing the island primarily for "fur, fish, and game" resources, including bears, but managing it in such a way that individuals could continue to defend their livestock.
As a consequence of the agents' report, the Game Commission did not liberalize bear-hunting regulations nor did it pursue any further active bear control.
2.2.7 Kodiak National Wildlife Refuge and World War II
To address the dilemma of conserving bears while protecting cattle and residents, President Franklin D. Roosevelt established the Kodiak National Wildlife Refuge (KNWR) by Executive Order in 1941.
The refuge withdrew 1,957,000 acres from unreserved public domain to preserve the natural feeding and breeding range of bears and other wildlife.
The area encompassed all of Uganik Island and most of southern and western Kodiak Island, except for the Karluk Indian Reservation.
A one-mile shoreline strip, included within the refuge boundary as described by executive order, remained open for settlement, sale, or other disposition under the public land laws applicable to Alaska, or to classification and lease for fur farming or other purposes.
In 1958, these exceptions involving the shoreline strip were removed through a public land order.
World War II brought an unprecedented increase of people, structures, and activity to Alaska.
The population of Kodiak city swelled from about 400 to more than 20,000.
A submarine base, an air station, a fleet weather command, and an army command post were established near Buskin River.
Remote submarine and aircraft observation posts were developed on numerous islands and capes in the archipelago.
The Army also developed logging operations page 2-4 February 2002

on Afognak Island.
While sport hunting for bears declined during the war, indirect impacts on bears abounded, and, in 1942, the Game Commission reduced the bag limit on the archipelago to one bear per year.
Refuge establishment and the war did little, however, to quell the concerns about bears preying on salmon.
During the 1940s, the sockeye escapement on the Karluk River dwindled, and bears were cited as a leading cause of the decline.
One study indicated that bears killed a third of the salmon entering the Karluk River before they had a chance to spawn, resulting in a loss of $3 million per year.
Fishermen called for bear control, and sportsmen across the nation lobbied against it.
Follow-up studies revealed that bears did kill a large number of salmon, but the vast majority (98 percent) were fish that had already spawned, and that the impact of bears on future salmon runs was minimal.
After considering these diverse opinions and results of the studies, as well as the concerns of fishermen and continued concerns about bear-cattle interactions, the Alaska Game Commission again opted to forego any bear control or huntingseason liberalization.
It did, however, pass a new regulation in 1957 that protected maternal female bears statewide.
The next year, that protection was extended to also include dependent cubs. 2.2.8 Changes in Alutiiq Use of Bears
The Alutiit continued to subsistence hunt for bears after the first harvesting regulations were developed in 1925.
(See chapter 4, section 4.2, for more information on the history of subsistence hunting.)
Gradually, however, subsistence hunting for bears diminished, in part due to more complex regulations and a burgeoning deer population, which provided an alternate source of red meat.
Some Alutiiq hunters continued their traditional harvest activities through the 1940s, '50s, and '60s.
Bear hides, meat, and other parts were used locally, and some hides were sold for income3.
Legally sanctioned subsistence bear hunting was opened by the State of Alaska from 1985 through 1987, but there appeared to be little interest.
In 1997, the subsistence bear hunt was reinstated under federal management, with a limited number of permits available to each of the Kodiak archipelago villages (see section 2.2.9).
2.2.9 After Statehood
Alaska achieved statehood in 1959 and assumed responsibility for managing the state's wildlife.
The Game Commission's successor, the Alaska Board of Game, reduced bear-hunting seasons on Afognak and Raspberry islands and on KNWR.
They also implemented a hidesealing requirement, established a tag fee for nonresident bear hunters, and stationed a game biologist in Kodiak.
At the same time, the board liberalized bear seasons on nonrefuge lands on Kodiak Island and initiated another investigation into bear-cattle problems on northeastern Kodiak Island.
During the 1960s, state biologists worked with ranchers along the Kodiak road examine and reduce the predation problem.
During the project, 15 bears were killed and several more were killed by hunters and ranchers.
Biologists reported cattle and compatible.
Potential solutions included poisons, fences to isolate cattle ranges, and land disposals in areas with bears.

Kodiak Archipelago Bear Conservation and Management Plan
Sportsmen concerned about bears being killed because of conflicts between bears and cattle published articles that described a "secret" state-sanctioned program that employed the use of fighter pilots to shoot bears from the air.
There was also a detailed description of the ground efforts by biologists and the ongoing anti-bear campaign by ranchers.
In spite of this public pressure, the state continued its involvement in dispatching problem bears and attempted to capture and move some bears.
From 1966 through 1969, the state authorized the use of dogs to hunt bears on northeastern Kodiak Island.
Same-day airborne hunting was prohibited in 1967.
In that same year, hunters were required to bring the skulls of harvested bears out of the field, and, in 1968, skull-sealing was required.
Population studies around Karluk Lake suggested the local harvest was excessive, so the drainage was closed to fall bear hunting in 1967 (by emergency order) and 1968 (by regulation).
In an additional effort to better distribute bear harvests on the refuge, a permit-quota system was established in 1968.
In 1969, the bag limit for bears was reduced to one bear per four years, and, for most of the archipelago, the winter hunting season was eliminated.
In late 1970, the state issued a policy curtailing bear-control programs.
Ranchers suffering losses could continue to take bears in DLP, but could not shoot bears from airplanes or poison them.
Sport hunting was to be the primary means of reducing bear numbers, and hunting regulations were liberalized.
Ranchers were upset with the decision and continued to devise ways to protect their livestock without government intervention.
2.2.10 Federal Legislation
Discovery of the Prudhoe Bay oil field and a national surge of environmental awareness resulted in new legislation that affected Kodiak.
In 1971, the Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act (ANCSA) resolved many long-standing land issues with aboriginal Alaskans statewide.
The impacts were felt strongly on the archipelago as large areas of the coastline (the Karluk River drainage; Sitkalidak, Spruce, and Whale islands) and most of the forested areas of Afognak and Raspberry islands were conveyed to Native corporations.
Federal management of the National Forest lands on Afognak was threatened, and KNWR lost control of 310,000 acres of prime bear habitat (more than 17 percent of refuge lands).
Other pertinent new legislation included the Wilderness Act, the Endangered Species Act, the National Environmental Policy Act, and the Marine Mammals Protection Act.
Also in 1972, the government review found that as much as 97 percent of the refuge qualified as wilderness under the guidelines of the Wilderness Act.
Sharp increases in the demand for bear-hunting permits occurred in 1972 and again in 1973.
Restrictions in season length on the Alaska Peninsula and the loss of polar bear hunting due to the Marine Mammals Protection Act were partially responsible for the surge.
In 1975, the state created 19 exclusive guiding areas on the archipelago.
The state also began distributing most of the bear hunting permits on Kodiak Island by lottery.
Twenty-six hunt areas were established, Alaska residents were allocated at least 60 percent of the permits, and all harvested bears had to be inspected by a state biologist in Kodiak.

2.2.11
Draft Management Plans
To address the changing relationships and uses of bears, the Alaska Department of Fish and Game (ADF
The plans called for specific management priorities, including areas that would provide high-quality hunting conditions, areas where bear conflicts with livestock and
people would be minimized, and areas that would be managed to provide opportunities to view and photograph bears.
In spite of the effort and public input involved in developing these plans, the Board of Game did not formally adopt them.
2.2.12 Timber Harvest
The USDA Forest Service (USFS) started planning the first timber sale on Afognak Island in 1966.
Many local citizens were surprised by the plan to renew logging on Afognak after a 25yr hiatus, and they were opposed to clearcut harvesting, noting the slow regeneration times for trees that had been previously cut from the island.
In response to these protests, and because of the newly established National Environmental Policy Act, USFS delayed the sale and drafted an environmental impact statement.
Projected impacts on bears included disturbance by logging activities and road traffic, disruption of salmon feeding areas, increased hunter access, and increased bear-human encounters resulting in bears being killed in DLP situations.
Finally, in 1975, USFS began construction of a logging road between Kazakof (Danger) Bay and Discoverer Bay, and timber harvesting began in 1977.
Under ANCSA's provisions, the Native villages of Afognak, Kodiak, and Ouzinkie selected many of the prime forest lands on Afognak Island as well as many of the coastal areas.
Koncor Forest Products began managing timber harvests on Kodiak and Ouzinkie lands in 1978, and the next year Afognak Native Corporation took over management of its recently acquired lands.
Passage of the Alaska National Interest Lands Conservation Act (ANILCA) in 1980 added the northwestern portion of Afognak Island to the refuge, but it also curtailed USFS management on the island.
In subsequent years, the rate of timber harvest was greatly accelerated over original projections.
2.2.13 Hydroelectric Development
In 1979, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission began working on an environmental impact statement for the Terror Lake hydroelectric project.
The project was to include an earthen dam on Terror Lake o KNWR and a six-mileÂ­long tunnel through a mountain ridge to a penstock and powerhouse in the Kizhuyak River drainage.
The proposed project was to be the first significant invasion of inland bear habitat on Kodiak Island.
To address the opposition encountered from the public and agencies, a mitigation settlement was negotiated in 1981.
The settlement was precedent-setting in its scope, providing for studies of project impacts on salmon, mountain goats, and bears during the three years of construction and two years of operation of the project.
It also set aside most of the state and Kodiak Island Borough lands on the Shearwater Peninsula to be managed as wildlife habitat (including a livestock-grazing prohibition) and established the Kodiak Brown Bear Research and Habitat Maintenance Trust (also called the

Kodiak Brown Bear Trust).
The Kodiak Brown Bear Trust is a 501(c)3 nonprofit corporation created as part of the 1981 mitigation agreement (see Appendix S) between U.S. Fish 
In the end, the forethought and planning were successful, and there were few negative impacts on bears that could be directly related to the Terror Lake hydroelectric project.
2.2.14 Increased Research Efforts
Human alteration of bear habitat on Kodiak and Afognak islands spurred renewed interest and funding for bear research on the archipelago, resulting in a surge of baseline and applied bear research on Kodiak through the 1980s and 1990s.
Extensive use of radiotelemetry on bears revealed denning, feeding, movement, mortality rates, and reproductive history patterns.
Perhaps the most significant result of the research was development of an objective method of measuring bear population densities and trends on specific parts of Kodiak Island.
Application of this technique to several parts of Kodiak Island, along with some extrapolation to the rest of the archipelago, provided the first refined estimate of bear numbers (2,980) and density (0.62 bears per square mile).
Another significant event for bears in the early 1980s was a surge in the deer populations throughout the archipelago.
By that time, deer had occupied all available habitat with an estimated population in excess of 100,000 and a peak harvest in 1987 with an estimated 13,791 deer killed by 6,022 hunters.
Some bears actively preyed on deer, especially when they were concentrated on winter and late-spring ranges along the coast; in most cases, however, such predation seemed opportunistic at best.
The number of bear-human encounters grew steadily, and it was evident that individual bears quickly discovered techniques to claim hunter-killed deer in the field and at campsites.
Increasing encounters translated into more DLP bear mortalities.
Efforts to educate hunters about bears were accelerated, with an emphasis on ways to avoid bear encounters and how to handle them if they occurred.
2.2.15 Oil and Gas Development
Commencing prior to 1976, a series of oil and gas lease sales have been attempted or conducted on either side of the Kodiak archipelago.
Estimated recoverable reserves range between 150 million and 1.9 billion barrels of oil and as much as 2.920 trillion cubic feet of natural gas on the east side of the archipelago.
Mean projections for the Shelikof Strait, on the west side of the archipelago, are 120 million barrels of oil and 680 billion cubic feet of gas.
In all cases, the natural gas is characterized as "wet," or containing high proportions of volatile liquids, which would have to be separated and either re-injected into the field or transported.
Evaluation by the federal Minerals Management Service of the impacts from developing these resources included identification of 15 potential onshore sites on the east side of Kodiak Island, including several in KNWR, with other unspecified potential sites on the west side of Afognak Island and northwestern Kodiak Island.

Biology, History, and Management
No past hydrocarbon lease sale resulted in hydrocarbon field development; this is due to either failure to discover recoverable deposits in the Shelikof Strait (Lease Sale #60) or limited interest on the part of the oil industry because of the projected difficulty of operations with thencurrent technology on the east side of the archipelago.
However, because of recent advances in deep-water drilling technology and acoustic survey techniques, along with the growing energy shortages in the nation, the region may be reconsidered for exploration and development in the future.
Predicting the configuration and impacts of hydrocarbon development on the archipelago may be as difficult as projecting the likelihood of discovering recoverable reserves if drilling occurs.
Should hydrocarbon development take place, however, it is likely that impacts, on the bears and their habitat, of the development and associated human activities will become significant aspects of all bear-management considerations.
2.2.16 Exxon Valdez Oil Spill
In 1989, the oil tanker Exxon Valdez ran aground on a reef in Prince William Sound.
Within the first week, oil dispersed to the islands of the Kodiak archipelago.
Marine mammals, including sea otters, seals, sea lions, and whales, were oiled and poisoned; coastal birds and mammals were also affected because feeding and resting areas were tainted.
Biologists were concerned that bears foraging in the oiled intertidal areas would be adversely affected.
The intensity of human activity on beaches and near shore waters was increased by the presence of cleanup crews; resource managers recognized that the impact to bears of those workers was potentially greater than the impact of the oil itself.
To minimize bear-human encounters, bearsafety training was required for everyone involved with the cleanup.
Bears were not directly harmed by the spill, although some were displaced, by cleanup crews, from traditional feeding and traveling areas.
No one was injured by a bear, and no Kodiak bears were killed.
To mitigate the adverse impacts of the spill, Exxon reached a settlement with the state and federal governments for $1 billion.
Paradoxically, the impacts of the oil spill and the subsequent cleanup and settlement proved to be beneficial to bears on Kodiak.
Bear-safety training exposed thousands of workers to factual information about bears, and the media raised the consciousness of people around the world to the fragility of the ecosystem.
Political pressure mounted to preserve Kodiak's pristine habitats, and money from the Exxon Valdez settlement fund was the obvious source for land acquisitions.
By the close of the 1990s, about 90 percent (290,000 acres) of the refuge lands that had been lost as a result of ANCSA were reinstated into the refuge, either through direct purchase or by means of conservation easements.
Using monies from the Exxon Valdez oil spill settlement fund, lands were also purchased on Afognak (83,2999 acres) and Shuyak (26,665 acres) islands and transferred into state ownership.
The Kodiak Brown Bear Trust coordinated a coalition of sportsmen and other wildlife conservation groups from around the nation to lobby for use of settlement funds to acquire Kodiak lands.
The groups also directly contributed funding to protect small parcels of important bear habitat around the islands.

Bear Viewing
Although hunting continued to be the most popular human use of bears on Kodiak in the early 1990s, the area was experiencing an expansion of bear viewing and bear photography.
The publicity the islands and the bears received during and after the oil spill and growth of statewide tourism motivated people to come and see the bears in their natural habitat.
To address this public demand, a bear-viewing program was administered by KNWR in 1990.
The program was cancelled after 1994 because of a legal challenge to the procedures used in awarding the bear-viewing concession.
Biologists studied bear-human interactions at the viewing areas and concluded that bears could tolerate viewing programs as long as the human activities were predicable and restricted to specific areas (Wilker and Barnes 1998).
Given the importance of the subject of bear viewing, a significant portion of chapter 6 (see section 6.6) is devoted to a discussion and recommendations on the topic.
2.3 Current Kodiak Bear Management
Kodiak archipelago bear research, management, and habitat protection are done cooperatively by ADF
Primary authority for managing the bears rests with ADF
The mission of ADF
The specific objectives for management of Kodiak bears are Â· Â· Â· to maintain a stable Kodiak bear population that will sustain an annual harvest of 150 bears, composed of at least 60 percent males; to maintain diversity in the sex and age composition of the bear population, with adult bears of all ages represented in the population and in the harvest; and to limit human-caused mortality of female bears to a level consistent with maintaining maximum productivity.
Kodiak bear population estimates were developed for nine study areas with the intensive aerial survey technique.
This technique is a modification of the capture-recapture methods that initially used radio-collared bears to determine the chance of seeing bears in different types of terrain and vegetation (observability).
Aerial transects are then flown within the study area to count bears, and total counts are multiplied by the observability factors to derive population estimates.
Surveys are conducted in the spring, immediately following the bear-hunting season, prior to spring green-up and after most bears have emerged from their dens.
At least one of the nine study areas is surveyed each year, and attempts are made to resurvey each area within five to seven years.

Kodiak National Wildlife Refuge
U.S. Fish 
ANILCA states the following: The purposes for which the Kodiak National Wildlife Refuge is established and shall be managed include (i) to conserve fish and wildlife populations and habitats in their natural diversity including, but not limited to, Kodiak bears, salmonids, sea otters, sea lions, and other marine mammals and migratory birds;
(ii) to fulfill the international treaty obligations of the United States with respect to fish and wildlife and their habitats; (iii) to provide, in a manner consistent with the purposes set forth in subparagraphs (i) and (ii), the opportunity for continued subsistence uses by local residents; and (iv) to ensure, to the maximum extent practicable and in a manner consistent with the purposes set forth in paragraph (i), water quality and necessary water quantity within the refuge.
2.3.2 Hunting
The current bear population is above the minimum level set by the state's current objectives, and it supports an annual harvest of approximately 160 Kodiak bears (69 percent males) each year under tightly controlled regulations.
About 5,000 resident hunters apply each year for a chance at the 319 bear permits (107 in fall and 212 in spring) available to them.
Hunters who are not residents of Alaska vie for some 153 permits (53 in fall and 100 in spring) and must hire professional guides, paying $9,000Â­15,000 per hunt.
Since 1997, a federally authorized subsistence hunt allows issuance of as many as 11 bear permits for the six Native communities on the Kodiak archipelago (see chapter 4, section 4.2).
ADF
2.3.3 Bears Killed in Defense of Life or Property
Bears may also be legally killed under the state's DLP provisions (5 AAC4 92.410).
A person may legally kill a bear if that person did not provoke an attack or cause a problem by leaving food or garbage lying around, and if that person has done everything else practical to protect life or property.
Property is defined as a dwelling, means of travel, pets, or other valuable property necessary for livelihood or survival.
A bear killed under DLP provisions must be reported immediately, and the hide and skull must be given to the state.
Reporting rates for DLP mortalities are unknown, but suspected to be less than 50 percent of the actual kill.
During the summer of 1999, when the population of bears on Kodiak was at a historic high, as many problem bears (eight) were killed near the city of Kodiak as had been killed in the 4

previous nine years combined.
Kodiak Island villages also had more bear problems than ever, and deer hunters reported a dramatic increase in bear encounters islandwide, including the first fatal mauling in more than 60 years.
The rash of bear confrontations was probably caused by a disastrous failure of berries, on which the bears depended for food in early August.
Some of the worst winter weather in 40 years struck the island during the winter of 1998Â­99 and damaged the berry bushes so severely that they could not produce fruit.
In their search for food, some bears found garbage, livestock, and dog food, bringing bears in close contact with people.
2.3.4 Changing Public Involvement
The reaction to these bear encounters by residents, visitors, and government agents reflected the increased tolerance and knowledge of the populace.
Kodiak residents requested and received bear-education programs for school children, for public television and radio, and for ethnic groups.
Waste management was enhanced by installation of bear-resistant dumpsters in rural areas on the Kodiak road system and by increased enforcement of litter laws.
A previously installed electric fence around the community landfill was reinforced, vegetative cover within the fence was removed, and garbage was buried more frequently (see Appendix N).
Deer and elk hunters were alerted to the potentially dangerous situation.
When the fatal mauling occurred, media were quick to point out the hunter's errors rather than to blame the bear; law enforcement and wildlife officials did not hunt or kill the bear responsible for the mauling.
All in all, the community pulled together to address the problems and everyone, including the bears, benefited.
Most of the people of Kodiak are proud of the fact that they live with the largest bears, and one of the densest populations of bears, in the world.
They are willing to take an active role in ensuring continued coexistence.
This increased ownership of the bears also resulted in a call to have a citizens advisory committee work closely with ADF
2.4 The Archipelago's Residents
The archipelago is also home for about 14,000 people, all residing in coastal areas.
The City of Kodiak and associated road-connected communities include almost 13,000 people, with most of the remainder of the population residing in the six villages on Kodiak and Spruce islands.
During the summer, the human population increases dramatically and disperses throughout coastal areas.
Remote cabins and lodges are used in support of commercial fishing and recreational activities.
Human use of inland areas is usually transient, with the exception of Afognak Island where extensive logging has been conducted for the past 25 years.
Kodiak bears contribute to Kodiak's economy by providing hunting, viewing, and other opportunities to enjoy wildlife and recreational pursuits in an unmolested natural setting.
Along with Kodiak's commercial and sport fisheries, these activities, contribute to every aspect of the area's economy, including tourism, lodging, transportation, and related professions such as guiding.
In fact, most businesses and jobs in Kodiak benefit directly or indirectly from the conservation of Kodiak bears and their habitat.

Bears also are responsible for economic losses to cattle ranchers, campers, and home owners, and bear-human interactions can result in destruction of private property and DLP bear mortalities.
Kodiak's balanced ecosystem, of which people are an integral part, forms the baseline from which this plan was designed.
The plan is not intended to seek remedies for a threatened bear population; rather, it is an analysis of a successful coexistence between people and bears and an attempt to improve on that situation to accommodate shifts in human uses of bears.
It also suggests ways to reduce people-bear conflicts in a mutually beneficial manner in the face of anticipated increases in human activities and impacts within the archipelago.

Kodiak Bear Habitat Synopsis: Kodiak bears live throughout most of the Kodiak archipelago and use virtually all available habitats from the coast to alpine regions.
The archipelago is considered high-quality bear habitat, containing ample food, water, cover, and space.
While vegetation is a substantial part of the bears' diet, salmon is the most important source of protein for most Kodiak bears.
Currently, the human population and related human development have minimal impacts on bear habitat.
Potential threats include seasonal human use of inland and coastal areas, future developments (e.g., road and energy development) and related problems (e.g., oil spills), and natural occurrences (e.g., reduction in salmon stocks).
Bear habitat and bear-human relationship are intimately intertwined; if people are not willing to make an effort to live around bears, large expanses of wilderness areas are necessary for sustainable bear populations.
With this information in mind, the Citizens Advisory Committee(CAC) makes a number of recommendations to protect bear habitat on the archipelago.
These recommendations cover the following subject areas: land use, acquisition, and planning; activities on Afognak Island; minimizing habitat degradation; road building in bear habitat; motorized access; bear-use areas; human activities in bear habitat; introduced species; and salmon as a part of bear habitat.

Kodiak Bear Habitat
3.1.1
Food and Water
Bears use a wide variety of foods on Kodiak; grasses, roots, berries, carrion, and salmon are the most important.
Bears' intelligence and their need to obtain large quantities of high-quality food while they are out of their dens have resulted in a high degree of adaptability.
This adaptability is most obvious to us when bears live near people and learn to eat garbage, pet food, and hunter-killed game instead of more natural fare.
3.1.2 Salmon
While vegetation is the bulk of the bears' diet, salmon are the primary source of protein for most Kodiak bears.
These same salmon stocks are also heavily used by humans for commercial, subsistence, and sport harvests.
Current Alaska Department of Fish

Archipelago salmon production has evolved from historical lows to historical highs during the 40-year period since statehood, when ADF
Human fisheries harvest activities are controlled by the Alaska Board of Fisheries via management plans guided by Alaska's Sustainable Fisheries Policy.
Additionally, Kodiak's Regional Comprehensive Salmon Management Plan, as developed by Kodiak's Regional Planing Team (RPT) per AS5 16.10.375, depicts a salmon enhancement framework for achieving and sustaining long-term stability of Kodiak's salmon production.
Kodiak archipelago's bear populations have flourished under this management regime; both ADF
Approximately 350 streams annually provide significant salmon production for bear food and human harvests.
Of these, approximately three produce chinook, 33 produce sockeye, 147 produce coho, 104 produce chums, and all produce pinks.
Biological escapement ranges are targeted by ADF
Biological escapement goals (BEG) set the number of spawning salmon required to sustain maximum production levels for each salmon species.
Allowing escapements to fall below or go above these ranges may lead to lower production.
Escapements are monitored by daily hand tallies at 12 fish-weir sites, by frequent inseason aerial surveys, or by post-season foot surveys.
Established species-specific time-of-entry patterns are referenced in season against developing returns to evaluate run strengths.
Timely inseason adjustments to human harvest opportunities ensure that escapements are achieved.
Overall escapement goals by species for the archipelago are approximately 11,000 to 18,000 chinook; 1,307,000 to 1,959,000 sockeye; 90,000 to 150,000 coho; 140,000 to 420,000 chums; and 792,000 to 2,376,000 odd-year pinks or 2,142,000 to 5,226,000 even-year pinks.
These escapement levels should produce long-term average total returns approximating 38,000 chinook; 6,064,000 sockeye; 375,000 coho; 784,000 chums; and 4,752,000 odd-year pinks or 11,052,000 even-year pinks.
Total salmon returns during the decade of the 1990s exceeded these long-term production goals.

archipelago's healthy, stable salmon populations correlate closely with its current robust bear populations.
(See Appendix U, "Policy for Statewide Salmon Escapement Goals" for complete information about salmon escapement.)
3.1.2.1 Recommendations about Salmon as a Part of Bear Habitat Â· Â· Â· Â· Â· Endorse the Kodiak Area Salmon Management plans that regulate commercial fishing on and around the archipelago.
Continue to collect salmon escapement data to ensure the sustainability of salmon stocks.
Support operation of essential weirs islandwide and acquire weir sites where appropriate.
Ensure that easements for access to weir sites be restricted to use by essential personnel.
Continue to design all salmon enhancement and rehabilitation projects to minimize disturbance of bears and to avoid unnecessary damage to their wild habitats (see Appendix F for more information about salmon enhancement and rehabilitation projects).
Recognize that the protection of riverine and coastal habitats for bears will help sustain the annual Kodiak salmon commercial harvest, which generates an average exvessel value of $35 million and provides as many as 5,000 associated jobs.
Â·
3.1.2.2 Vegetation Bears rely primarily on vegetation when salmon are not present in rivers.
Although bears forage on a variety of vegetation, certain species of sedge and berry-producing shrubs are especially important.
Bears use sedges in estuaries during June and in alpine areas in late June and early July.
Berries produced by salmonberry, red-berried elder, blueberry, and devil's club shrubs are used extensively during summer.
Berry production influences bear movements away from salmon-spawning streams when berries are abundant and often results in increased bearhuman interactions during years when berry production is low.
Sitka black-tailed deer and Roosevelt elk were introduced onto the archipelago in the 1920s.
These ungulates proliferated and provided both humans and bears with an alternate food source.
Deer and elk also share food sources with bears.
In areas where they concentrate during the winter, the ungulates have heavily browsed some shrubs, including high-bush cranberry and redberried elder, which are important foods for bears.
It is not known what long-term impact this browsing will have on bear populations.
3.1.2.3 Recommendations about Introduced Species Â· Â· Identify funding sources to study effects of introduced species on bear habitat (see chapter 7, "Research and Monitoring").
Conduct research to determine if a problem exists with introduced species depleting bears' food resources or otherwise damaging bear habitat.
When evaluating the results of research on introduced species, consider social issues (e.g., subsistence hunting).

Kodiak Bear Habitat
Research should be subject to peer review (also see chapter 7, "Research and Monitoring").
Â· Â· Federal and state governments work with villages and other landowners to maintain the species that currently exist on the Kodiak archipelago.
Guard against the introduction of additional nonindigenous species that could prove harmful to bears and their habitat.
(See also section 6.4.1.)
3.1.2.4 Water Water availability is rarely a problem on the Kodiak archipelago, but it is a critical need for bears' consumption and thermoregulation.
Bears drink regularly, and ready supplies of fresh water are essential.
Because of their large size and thick coats of fur and fat, Kodiak bears are designed to stay warm.
When confronted with warm summer temperatures (
3.1.3 Cover
Cover requirements include protection from the weather, security from detection, and areas for denning.
Alder thickets, which abound in lower and middle elevations on Kodiak Island and southwestern Afognak Island, are the favored resting locations for bears during inclement weather and when they are sleeping.
The thickets also provide secure areas where bears can avoid being detected by people.
On Shuyak Island, northeastern Kodiak Island, and much of Afognak Island, spruce trees and the associated undergrowth of devil's club provide cover for bears.
Steep or rocky areas can also provide cover for family groups when they are avoiding predatory male bears.
Dens are typically dug, although natural cavities may be used if available.
Bears seek welldrained sites for dens.
When high, steep country is available, it is used; in areas of more moderate topographic relief, however, bear dens may occur in the sides of hills or hummocks.
When the substrate is not stable enough to support excavations, bears dig dens under the roots of alders or spruce trees.
3.1.4 Space
The physical arrangement, or spacing of resources within a bear's habitat is as important as the availability of the resource itself.
If food resources are not near places where the bears are secure, the animals will hesitate to use them.
Spacing of resources also refers to the time at which resources are used.
When forced to compete with other bears or with people for resources, bears may shift their activity patterns to reduce conflict.
This is why most bears living near human habitation adopt more nocturnal behavior.
3.2 Status of Bear Habitat on the Kodiak Archipelago
The Kodiak archipelago is arguably the best bear habitat in the world.
Thus, it supports one of the densest known populations of brown bears, and those bears grow larger than they do in most other areas.
February 2002 page 3-5
3.
Kodiak Bear Habitat
Kodiak Archipelago Bear Conservation and Management Plan
At the current time, Kodiak Island's inland habitat is contiguous and intact.
Coastal areas have much more human activity, but it is generally restricted to isolated areas and small numbers of people.
Roads are restricted to the northeastern coast of the island and in the immediate vicinity of villages.
The only large-scale disruption of inland habitat, the Terror Lake hydroelectric project, was completed with minimal direct or indirect adverse impact to bears or their habitat because of a conscious effort to work with and around the bears (see also section 2.2.13).
Wildfire, primarily human-caused, has burned an average of 1,135 acres of habitat annually over the past 10 years.
No research on the effects of wildfire on Kodiak bear habitat has been undertaken.
In summary, Kodiak bears are adaptable, and with a healthy habitat and human neighbors who are tolerant and knowledgeable, they can thrive.
Bear habitat and bear-human relationships are intimately intertwined, however, and if people are not willing to make the extra effort to live around bears, large expanses of wilderness areas are necessary for sustainable bear populations.
3.2.1 Logging on Afognak Island
Afognak Island's bear habitat has experienced considerable alteration in the past 25 years because of commercial logging on private lands.
These lands are primarily managed for timber production, but they are under the jurisdiction of the Forest Practices Act, which governs commercial logging and seeks to ensure that protection of natural resources is a high priority.
Large-scale logging has the potential of damaging wildlife habitat by diminishing or altering vegetative cover; increasing blockage of bear access corridors and access to salmonspawning streams by slash, erosion, and siltation; and causing indirect impacts through human activities.
Although there have been no objective studies, it appears that, despite the fact that there have been major changes to the habitat, these logging activities have not had major adverse impacts on the bear population.
The bears still have access to healthy salmon, and berry and grass production has been enhanced in many areas.
Hunting regulations in these logged areas have become more restrictive to limit the effects of direct persecution, and general access to logging roads has been restricted.
Commercial activities such as logging do not necessarily have negative impacts on bear habitat if appropriate mitigation or avoidance measures are taken.
It is often the cumulative effects that follow logging activities, particularly increased access, that impact bears.
This includes displacement of bears from important habitat, increased human presence in bear habitat, or defense of life or property (DLP) killing of bears.
3.2.1.1 Recommendations Regarding Afognak Island Â· Â· Establish an education plan and explore economic incentives aimed at encouraging public and private landowners to consider the effects of motorized access on bears.
Establish an education plan and explore economic incentives aimed at encouraging private landowners to continue land-management programs that are consistent with wildlife conservation.
Teach outdoor recreationists to be bear-aware.

Urge ADF
Respect private property rights, while recognizing private land owners' responsibilities to adhere to applicable laws in the conservation of bears and their habitats.
Human Population
Â· 3.2.2
The estimated resident human population of the Kodiak archipelago is 14,181 and has been relatively stable for the past 20 years.
More than 90 percent of the human populace lives along the road system that circumscribes Chiniak Bay on northeastern Kodiak Island.
Five-year averages show that each year approximately 4,360 people are in the field hunting deer, approximately 520 hunting elk, 95 hunting goats, and 510 hunting bears.
Each year, an average 15,565 anglers fish in Kodiak's fresh and salt waters.
Commercial fishing is vital to the economy of the region; fishing and fish-processing occur year-round.
During summer months, however, residents and transients alike expand their activities to remote coastal areas in pursuit of salmon.
Residents of the Kodiak archipelago generally have a higher tolerance and a greater understanding of bears than do people in many other areas.
To ensure this understanding, various agencies make ongoing efforts to educate newcomers and visitors and to minimize attracting bears to human habitat.
As the human population expands its activities throughout the archipelago, however, human encroachment into bear habitat could pose problems for bears.
3.2.2.1 Recommendations Regarding Human Activities in Bear Habitat Â· Maintain or enhance the current high-quality bear habitat on the Kodiak archipelago by protecting riparian areas, including water quality and salmon resources; protecting healthy and contiguous upland areas; and continuing the type of human uses of the area that fosters coexistence.
Strongly encourage education of outdoor recreationists about bear behavior, impacts to bear habitat, bear-human interactions (e.g., resulting from improperly handled food and trash), field safety practices, and use of bear-resistant containers and electric fences, etc. (see also chapter 8, "Education").
Distribute to refuge users educational materials on building safe campfires(see also chapter 8, "Education").

Kodiak Archipelago Land Management
Lands of the Kodiak archipelago are primarily managed by three major entities (see Figure 3-2): U.S. Fish 
Shuyak, eastern Afognak, western Raspberry, northeastern Kodiak, Sitkinak, and Tugidak islands are primarily state lands.
Native landowners control most of Afognak, Whale, Spruce, and Sitkalidak islands and coastal areas on northern Kodiak Island.
Much of the Karluk and Sturgeon rivers, the Akhiok area, and the eastern part of Raspberry Island are also managed by Native landowners.
Kodiak National Wildlife Refuge (KNWR) encompasses the southern two-thirds of Kodiak Island, the northwestern portion of Afognak Island, and all of Uganik Island.
Beginning in the 1970s, Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act (ANCSA) legislation conveyed to Native ownership some 310,000 acres (approximately 20 percent) of KNWR.
During the 1990s, a broad coalition of interest groups--using money from Exxon Valdez oil spill settlement funds, the Land and Water Conservation Fund, and private donations--purchased back high-quality bear habitat from willing sellers.
These lands are now managed by KNWR or the Alaska State Park System.
Management of bear populations requires close attention to direct human-caused mortality, such as annual harvest levels, as well indirect human impacts, such as management of habitat.
Wildlife managers recognize that the cumulative effects of increasing land-use activities may ultimately result in an irreversible decline in bear numbers.
Accordingly, conservation of the Kodiak bear population should be considered in comprehensive land-use planning and landacquisition decisions.

3.2.3.1 Recommendations for Land Use, Land Acquisition, and Planning Â· Â· Â· Â· Â· Â· Â· Â· Continue acquiring small parcels of high-priority bear and salmon habitat from informed willing sellers.
Consider bear habitat when evaluating lands for acquisition.
In any land transfer, recognize subsistence activity, consistent with state and federal laws.
When their lands are affected, involve village representatives and individuals associated with remote camps in land-acquisition planning.
Consider bear habitat when conducting land disposals on state land.
Pursue the acquisition of high-priority bear and salmon habitat on Afognak and Shuyak islands to complete the planned state park units there.
Through land-use planning, maintain contiguous bear and salmon habitat (i.e., avoid patchwork development).
Retain state and federal agency access to salmon populations to allow monitoring of stock status.
Retain historical salmon rehabilitation and enhancement options identified in Kodiak's comprehensive salmon plan (i.e., lake fertilization, stocking of barren lakes, hydroacoustic surveys of smolt and presmolt populations, use of barrier nets in terminal harvest areas, monitoring of weir sites and fish passes, lake monitoring through limnology assessment, smolt enumeration through mark and recapture, and conducting egg-takes for out-stocking programs) (see also Appendix F).
Encourage private landowners (e.g., via the use of conservation easements, economic incentives, and education) to consider bear habitat when making land-management decisions.
Encourage a high level of cooperation among various landowners to achieve ecosystem management objectives for bears.
Urge all parties to work cooperatively to ensure successful implementation of the conservation easement agreement on the Karluk and Sturgeon rivers watersheds.
Urge ADF
Encourage Bureau of Land Management, USFWS, the public, and landowners to together review controversial 17(b) easements and corridors, renegotiate terms and conditions if proved necessary to prevent resource damage, and consider relocating or relinquishing easements that adversely impact important bear habitat.
The CAC strongly recommends discouraging off-road vehicle (ORV) use on easements not currently used by ORVs.

Kiliuda and Shearwater Habitats
Kodiak bear research is an important priority for ADF
Kodiak bear research began with harvest statistics in the 1940s when it was recognized that Kodiak Island was producing the largest brown bears (measured by skull size).
Over the decades, the data collected on Kodiak bears have grown, and the technology and methods of the researchers have improved.
Research on bear population density is perhaps the most important tool for effective bear management.
In 1996, the Kodiak Brown Bear Trust partnered with the State of Alaska, USFWS, and the National Rifle Association to fund a brown-bear abundance and habitat assessment study in the Kiliuda Bay section of KNWR and the Shearwater Peninsula.
Objectives of the study included the following: Â· Â· Â· estimation of brown-bear abundance in a 150Â­square-mile area estimation of the brown-bear habitat quality on the Shearwater Peninsula mitigation lands for the Terror Lake Hydroelectric Project revision of brown-bear population estimates for the Kodiak archipelago
The Kiliuda/Shearwater study project was important because previous research on Kodiak bears had focused on the southern and western portions of Kodiak Island.
Knowledge of bear populations on the island's eastern drainages was limited, consisting mainly of hunters' observations and occasional bear sightings incidental to aerial salmon-escapement surveys.
In contrast with drainages in southern and western Kodiak Island, eastern drainages are shorter and steeper, and salmon populations are less diverse and abundant.
No major sockeye salmon systems occur within KNWR on the eastern side of the island.
3.3.1 Summary of Kiliuda-Shearwater Findings
Two types of aerial surveys (transect and intensive) produced 239 sightings of bear groups during the May 19Â­27, 1996, survey period.
Single animals and family groups accounted for about one-half and one-third of the observations, respectively.
The remaining observations were of bears in breeding and sibling groups.
February 2002

Kodiak Bear Habitat
Kodiak Archipelago Bear Conservation and Management Plan
Bears were found throughout the study area, with the largest number of sightings recorded in the areas immediately north and east of the head of Kiliuda Bay (Shearwater Peninsula; see Figure 3-3).
More than 75 percent of the bears were found in midslope (500Â­1,500 ft) habitats.
Observation rates indicated that bear density was higher than predicted.
Density of total bears was estimated at 360 independent bears in the 374-square mile area (0.96/sq mi).
This density ranks the area as the second highest brown-bear population density on the Kodiak archipelago, second only to the Karluk Lake drainage's 179 bears in the 121-square mile area (1.48 bears/sq mi).
An assessment of habitat quality on the study area was based on the aerial survey data, distribution and abundance of salmon, and the distribution and level of human activity associated with developments on private land.
Streams with strong runs of chum and pink salmon were highlighted as key feeding sites for bears.
Considerable development has occurred in parts of the Shearwater Peninsula, and continued development could have an adverse effect on bears.
Conversely, acquisition of private inholdings on the Kiliuda peninsula is nearly complete and has reduced threats to bears in portions of Kiliuda Bay.
Currently, a high proportion of bear habitat on the Shearwater-Kiliuda area is intact and sustaining negligible or low levels of human activity.
Data from this study indicate that the north side of Kiliuda Bay supports high levels of bear use during spring and summer and is an area where further development of private parcels could be detrimental to the bear population.
Biologists have identified the Shearwater Peninsula as having high densities of Kodiak bears.
The CAC believes it is important that human impact (i.e., development) be minimized in this important bear habitat.
3.3.2 Â· Â· Recommendations Regarding the Shearwater Peninsula 6
State lands should continue to be managed consistent with terms of the 1981 Terror Lake Agreement (see Appendix S).

Potential Threats to Bear Habitat
Resident human populations are relatively stable, most of the lands are managed for healthy ecosystems, and no large-scale developments are currently proposed.
3.4.1 Use of Back-Country Areas
Of greatest concern is the increasing seasonal human use of inland and coastal areas.
Backcountry use of streams continues to gain in popularity; in some locales, this includes private land that has been acquired for public use.
The increase in sport fishing and camping along these streams is generating conflicts between people and bears.
Use of ORVs and snowmachines has continued to expand throughout the state, especially in road-accessible areas of southcentral and interior Alaska.
Riders are taking these machines into previously undisturbed bear habitat and affecting both the physical habitat and the security of bears.
The majority of the increase is associated with the use of four-wheel all-terrain vehicles (ATVs) particularly associated with nonhunting recreational use.
Increasing public complaints and observations of resource managers indicate that some areas of Alaska experience problems February 2002 page 3-13

with ORV and snowmachine use.
Typical problems include damage to soils and vegetation, displacement of wildlife, and conflicts with other outdoor users.
Unregulated motorized access can potentially impact bear habitat on the Kodiak archipelago.
US.
Fish and Wildlife Service has the authority to limit ORV use on refuge lands, and use of ORVs is not allowed on USFWS managed lands within KNWR. 3.4.1.1 Recommendations Related to Bear-Use Areas Â· USFWS should work with ADF
On USFWS land, restrict back-country use (e.g., require permits) before resorting to total closure to use (USFWS must be equipped to do so).
Continue to seek enhanced funding for identification and study of important and critical bear habitat.
Manage critical bear habitat to prevent adverse impacts.
Consider restricting human use on important streams if there are documented adverse impacts on salmon stocks, bears, or both.

3.4.1.2 Recommendations Regarding Motorized Access Â· Â· Â· Â· Â· Create baseline information regarding ORV use throughout the archipelago in order to evaluate areas of problems (see chapter 7, "Research and Monitoring").
The CAC strongly recommends discouraging ORV use on easements not currently used by ORVs.
Limit ORV use in important bear habitat areas (i.e., restrict recreational use of ORVs to designated-use areas [e.g., corridors]
Develop statewide legislation requiring the licensing and registration of ORVs.
Urge Kodiak Island Borough (KIB) to coordinate efforts among ADF
Commend private property owners' existing policies restricting motorized public access and encourage continuation of these policies.

The CAC objects to ORV manufacturers and retailers whose advertising (commercials) encourage unethical and damaging use of ORVs on public lands.
Seek the cooperation of ORV user groups to encourage more responsible use of ORVs while in bear habitat.
Prohibit air boats and personal watercraft (e.g., jet skis) in important bear habitat.
Enforce state and federal laws regarding the intentional harassment of bears with aircraft (also see section 6.7).
To minimize disturbance to bears, develop guidelines for overflying by helicopters for recreational purposes (also see section 6.7).
To minimize disturbance to bears, develop guidelines for overflying by fixed-wing aircraft for recreational purposes (also see section 6.7).
Road Building and Energy Development
Future developments that could have adverse impacts on bears include road and energy development.
A plan to construct a road to circumnavigate Kodiak Island has been proposed, but it is unlikely this project will proceed in the near future.
Oil and gas deposits in Shelikof Strait are available for leasing through the federal government (see also section 2.2.15).
Interest in these deposits is expected to be high; if they are proved and developed, exploration and extraction operations would probably be established on the Kodiak archipelago.
Sites for additional hydroelectric facilities on Kodiak Island have also been identified.
Access routes, including roads, can increase human presence in bear habitat.
Routes and roads may displace bears, fragment habitat, increase human use of an area, and lead to increased bear-human conflicts and DLP mortality.
Existing roads and the continued building of new roads in bear habitat could be detrimental to the long-term well-being of Kodiak bears.
More insidious threats to bear habitat are those that are not anticipated or are the cumulative effect of several minor impacts.
Climatic changes that reduce salmon stocks or berry production for long periods would have catastrophic impacts on bears.
Human-caused factors such as oil spills would also be detrimental.
The cumulative effects of increasing human uses in the backcountry, expansion of coastal facilities, and bears being killed in defense of life or property (DLP) near towns and villages are not fully understood, but have potentially greater impact than any single threat to Kodiak bear habitat.
3.4.2.1 Recommendations about Road Building in Bear Habitat Â· Â· Â· Explore alternatives to building new roads in important bear habitat areas.
Support closure (i.e., decommissioning) of obsolete logging roads on public and privately owned lands.
Continue existing practices to limit motorized public access to logging roads.

Wilderness and Wild Rivers Designations
The CAC recognizes that the Kodiak archipelago possesses outstanding and unique wilderness and wild river values of great importance to bears, salmon, and other fish and wildlife and believes these public resources should continue to be available for public use and enjoyment.
U.S. Fish 
Both reports found that most lands in the refuge meet criteria for designation as wilderness, defined in the Wilderness Act for size, ownership, natural integrity, naturalness, solitude, and primitive recreational opportunities.
Refuge lands were also found to possess outstanding special values, including some of the finest bear habitat in the world; hundreds of bald eagles, a refugium with unique characteristics; the most productive waterfowl habitat on the Kodiak archipelago; and spawning habitat for steelhead trout, Dolly Varden, Arctic char, and millions of Pacific salmon.
A succession of federal administrations has failed to act on these recommendations because of opposition from development interests, along with widespread public misunderstanding, confusion, and fear of what such designations might mean, especially in terms of access to and uses of refuge lands and waters.
The CAC believes it is essential that the public understand the true values, economic benefits, and possible impacts derived from proposed wilderness and wild river designations.

Harvest Issues Synopsis: Residents and visitors harvest a variety of fish, wildlife, and plant resources on the Kodiak archipelago.
All of these resource-extraction activities are interrelated with bears.
Management of the harvest of Kodiak bears is currently based primarily on population assessments and regulation of sport hunting.
With a healthy population of bears on the archipelago, the emphasis has been on maintaining a stable bear population that will sustain an annual harvest of 150 bears, composed of at least 60 percent males.
Subsistence harvest of bears is presently managed by the U.S. Fish 
Subsistence hunting permits are allocated each year: one in Akhiok, one in Karluk, three in Larsen Bay, two in Old Harbor, two in Ouzinkie, and two in Port Lions.
Sport hunting of bears in Game Management Unit 8 (Kodiak archipelago) is regulated by a complex system involving drawing hunts and registration hunts.
Nonresident bear hunters are required to use the services of a registered big-game guide.
The Citizens Advisory Committee(CAC) makes recommendations on a number of harvest issues, including the following: management of bear-harvest activities, subsistence use of bears, sport hunting, guiding, other resource-extraction activities, and regulations and their enforcement.
The Kodiak archipelago offers many opportunities to harvest a variety of resources.
Residents and visitors hunt deer, elk, mountain goats, and bears.
Commercial fishing and sport fishing are major industries on the archipelago.
Berries and other vegetation are regularly harvested by urban and rural residents.
Bear hunting has the most obvious direct impact on the bear population, but all of these harvest activities are interrelated with bears.
Bears share many food resources (such as salmon and berries) with humans, and humans harvesting resources in bear habitat may lead to bearhuman encounters resulting in injuries or death for either party.
Thus, to prepare a management plan for Kodiak bears, all types of harvesting activities and issues are taken into consideration.
These include subsistence use of bears; regulations governing hunters; the roles of guide/outfitters and transporters; the impacts of other resource extraction (i.e., harvest of other fish, vegetation, and wildlife); enforcement of regulations; population assessments and monitoring; the various natural habitats and their carrying capacities; and the needs and desires of human residents that define the wildlife-acceptance capacity7.
4.1 Current Management of Bear-Harvesting Activities
Hunting of bears on the Kodiak archipelago has a historical, customary, and traditional role in bear population management.
Kodiak has maintained a stable to increasing population of bears in part because of management policies and regulations addressing bear harvesting on the

archipelago.
In some areas near the City of Kodiak and around some villages on the archipelago, the population of bears has been perceived as increasing to the point of concern.
Management of the harvest of Kodiak bears is currently based primarily on population assessments and regulation of sport hunting.
With a healthy population of bears on the Kodiak archipelago, the emphasis has been on maintaining a stable bear population that will sustain an annual harvest of 150 bears, composed of at least 60 percent males.
When there is a need to reduce the bear population in a specific area, and thus reduce the incidence of killing bears in defense of life or property (DLP), hunter harvest is the preferred method.
During the past decade (1990Â­1999), hunters harvested an average of 160 Kodiak bears each year under tightly controlled regulation.
(For further description of Kodiak's bear-management, see section 2.3.)
Present management concerns include the following: Â· Â· Â· Â· Â· 4.1.1 Â· Are DLP mortalities being accounted for accurately? Are the allocations among users appropriate to current needs and desires? Although the natural carrying capacity of bear habitat is not being strained, is the wildlife-acceptance capacity being exceeded in any area of the archipelago? Is there a need to reduce the number of bears in any specific localities? Can population data be improved to keep harvest rates commensurate with bear densities? Recommendations on Management of Bear-Harvesting Activities Endorse Alaska Department of Fish 
Continue to prohibit the baiting of bears throughout the Kodiak archipelago.
Manage bear populations on carrying capacity and density as well as on harvest objectives (see chapter 5, "Redefining Bear-Management Strategy").
Recommend that ADF
Develop a co-management agreement with villages to reduce DLPs (see section 6.2) in and around villages and to provide economic incentives to conserve bears; this would include expansion of bear-safety practices, solid-waste management, encouraging Natives to become registered big-game guides, and consideration of bear-hunting permits in areas adjacent to villages.

Alutiiq residents of the Kodiak archipelago harvested bears for subsistence purposes for more than 7,000 years without external regulation, until 1925.
In that year, however, the Alaska Game Commission developed a harvest limit of three bears per year; and, in 1926, bear harvesting was prohibited during the summer months, except in DLP situations.
When Alaska became a state in 1959, the state government took over management of wildlife, including regulating harvest of bears.
The first specific subsistence hunting regulations for Kodiak bears were developed by the state in 1985, when the Alaska Board of Game established a registration permit hunt.
Because Alutiiq hunters believed it was illegal to hunt for bear, they did so without completing the required paperwork.
Consequently, the substantiation of that practice was not available, and ADF
Since then, subsistence bear hunting has not been allowed under state regulations.
In 1990, management authority for subsistence activities was assumed by the federal government (USFWS).
The subsistence bear hunt was reinstated under federal management in 1997, when interviews with Alutiit confirmed the continued subsistence use of bears.
At that time, the Federal Subsistence Board determined a customary and traditional use of bears by villages on the Kodiak archipelago and established subsistence hunting regulations for Kodiak bears.
Currently, USFWS manages subsistence activities on federal lands.
Subsistence hunting permits for Kodiak bears are available through the Kodiak National Wildlife Refuge (KNWR) each year as follows: one in Akhiok, one in Karluk, three in Larsen Bay, two in Old Harbor, two in Ouzinkie, and two in Port Lions.
The subsistence hunting seasons are December 1Â­15 and April 1Â­May 15.

Sport Hunting of Kodiak Bears
Regulation of bear hunting on the Kodiak archipelago is complex, probably the most complex regulatory system in Alaska.
Game Management Unit 8 (GMU 8), which comprises the Kodiak archipelago, is divided into 30 hunt areas.
Drawing permits are needed to hunt in 29 of these areas; hunting in the final area, which is along the Kodiak road system on northeastern Kodiak Island, is by registration permit.

Kodiak Archipelago Bear Conservation and Management Plan
There are two seasons for hunting bears in GMU 8: fall (October 25 through November 30) and spring (April 1 through May 15).
The individual bag limit for all areas is one bear every four years, and cubs or sows accompanied by their cubs cannot be taken.
All bear hunters receive a brief orientation from ADF
All bears killed in GMU 8 must be inspected and sealed by ADF
A resident hunter must have a hunting license and a bear tag.
Nonresident hunters for Kodiak bears must meet the additional requirement of hunting with a registered guide (see section 4.4).
Poaching of Kodiak bears is not common in part because it is difficult to access hunt areas without the services of air taxi or charter boat operators, who take great responsibility for reporting the hunting activities of their clients.
Another reason is the prevalence and diligence of Division of Fish 
4.3.1 Drawing Hunts
Hunting for bears in areas where hunter demand exceeds the number of animals available for harvest is regulated by drawing permits.
To hunt in one of the 29 areas governed by drawing permits, a hunter must first select the area and the season in which to hunt.
A hunter may apply for permits in as many as three areas for each season.
A certain number of permits are allocated for each hunt area for each season, with at least 60 percent of the permits going to Alaska residents.
An application for a drawing permit requires a hunting license and the appropriate application fee.
The overall odds of being drawn are 5 percent; in some popular areas, such as around Karluk, the odds are about 2 percent, whereas odds for being drawn for a hunt on Afognak Island are closer to 6 percent.
If a hunter's application is drawn, he or she must come to Kodiak to obtain the permit.
The hunter must personally speak with the area biologist, the wildlife technician, or the administrative clerk in the Kodiak ADF
After showing a valid hunting license and bear tag, the hunter receives the permit.
To do so, the hunter must sign a form agreeing to all the regulations governing its use (including provisions such as not shooting on the same day as flying in to the area).
The hunter then chooses and declares a 15-day period within which to use the permit to hunt Kodiak bear in the specific hunt area.
No guide is required for resident hunters, although some choose to use the services of guides to ensure a more successful hunt.
After the 15-day hunting period has ended, the hunter must return to the ADF
If the hunter is unsuccessful, a phone call is sufficient for checking out; hunter report cards, however, must be returned within 15 days.
Nonresident hunters must meet other requirements, the primary one being that, to hunt, she or he must have a licensed guide.
The hunter can be guided by someone of second-degree kindred (e.g., sibling, uncle or aunt, father or mother) or the hunter may hire a professional guide (see section 4.4).

Harvest Issues
Each registered or master guide in Alaska can select as many as three guide-use areas within the state in which to guide hunters.
A hunter can select any of these guides, unless the hunt is to take place on KNWR.
A hunter who wins a permit to hunt in an area on the refuge must select one of the guides who is permitted to guide in that area.
If for some reason the hunter does not wish to use a guide who is authorized for that hunt area, the permit is forfeited.
If a nonresident wins a permit in the drawing and decides not to take it, the permit goes to an alternate applicant.
If the alternate also declines the permit, it is then issued on a first-come, first-served basis to a person who has a signed agreement between a guide and the client.
This provision is designed to ensure that professional guides do not lose business if an application is submitted frivolously.
When a nonresident hunter is successful, he or she is required to check out and return the hunt report to ADF
The hunter may bring the hide and skull to ADF
4.3.2 Registration Hunts
Hunting in areas (e.g., northeastern Kodiak), where more bears may be harvested, is regulated by registration permit.
To get a registration hunt permit, however, the hunter must come to ADF
In a registration hunt, the number of permits is unlimited, but successful hunts must be reported and the hide and skull brought in for sealing within five days of the kill.
Unsuccessful hunters report by mail within 15 days of the close of season.
Registration hunts have the same requirements for use of guides as do drawing hunts.
4.3.3 Â· Â· Â· Recommendations about Sport Hunting of Kodiak Bears Maintain the tradition of bear hunting, consistent with the conservative management and regulatory regime that avoid overharvest of the resource.
Maintain the tradition of bear hunting, consistent with the highest ethical standards of safety and fair chase.

If reductions in harvest are necessary, consider ways of reducing the female harvest prior to reducing permit numbers (i.e., skull-sex minimums in southwestern Kodiak).
To better achieve wildlife-acceptance capacity (see section 5.3) along the Kodiak road system, increase bear harvest by extending the spring bear-hunting season to May 31.

Fair Chase, as defined by the Boone and Crockett Club, is the ethical, sportsmanlike and lawful pursuit and taking of any free-ranging wild, native North American big-game animal that does not give the hunter an improper advantage over such game animals.

Big-Game Guides, Outfitters, and Transporters
Big-game hunting is a significant business on the Kodiak archipelago, especially hunting for Kodiak bears, and many big-game hunters that do not live on the archipelago make use of guides or transporters.
No one may accept payment for providing a big-game hunting service (such as guiding) without having the appropriate license.
4.4.1 Guides and Outfitters
Nonresident bear hunters are required to use a guide (see section 4.3), and some residents also choose to avail themselves of the expertise and experience a guide offers.
Because guided bear hunts provide a source of significant income to not only the guide, but to the community as a whole, these animals are of considerable economic value to Kodiak.
To legally contract to provide big-game hunting services for clients, guides must fulfill stringent requirements to be licensed by the Alaska Department of Community and Economic Development, Division of Occupational Licensing.
Four levels of guide licenses can be earned: assistant guide, class-A assistant guide, registered guide, and master guide (one must have a guide's license in order to be an outfitter for big-game hunts.)
An applicant for an assistant guide license has to have hunted legally in the state during two calendar years and must have a written recommendation from a registered guide or other qualified person (as described in AS 08.54.630).
An assistant guide may not contract to guide or outfit a big-game hunt, but must be employed by a registered guide and under the supervision of either a registered guide or a class-A assistant guide while in the field.
Further, an assistant guide may not take charge of a camp or conduct guide activities unless the contracting registered guide is in the field and participating in the contracted hunt.
The class-A assistant guide license requires at least three years' experience as an assistant guide or 10 years' hunting experience in Alaska and a written recommendation from an appropriate source.
A class-A assistant guide cannot contract to guide or outfit a big-game hunt; he or she must be employed by and work under the supervision of a registered guide.
However, the class-A assistant guide may take charge of a camp and conduct guide activities from the camp without the contracting guide being present in the field.
To become a registered guide, a person must have significant practical field experience in a number of relevant activities.
He or she must also pass a qualifying examination (or have 25 years' experience as a class-A assistant guide or class-A assistant guide/outfitter), have hunted in the state for part of each of any five years, and have three years' experience as a class-A assistant guide or class-A assistant guide/outfitter.
In addition, the applicant must pass a certification examination prepared specifically for at least one game management unit.
She or he must also have been favorably recommended by eight big-game hunters and must show proof of financial responsibility.
To become a master guide, one must be licensed as a registered guide for at least 12 of the last 15 years.
He or she must submit a list of at least 25 clients for whom guiding or outfitting services have been provided, and must have received favorable evaluations from at least ten of

them.
A master guide may contract to guide or outfit hunts for big game and may provide transportation services.
When the master guide contracts for a guided hunt, he or she must be physically present in the field with the client at least once during the contracted hunt.
The preceding paragraphs describe only a portion of the requirements that guides must meet to be licensed.
Their licenses are evidence of extensive experience, skill, and value to their clients, and the penalties for not adhering to the legal requirements of their professional licenses are severe.
4.4.2 Transporters
A transporter is licensed to provide transportation, lodging, and similar services to the hunter but is not allowed to perform big-game guiding services.
By the same token, a transporter cannot call him or herself an outfitter.
Licensed transporters cannot set up tents in the field for hunters; they must own cabins and rent them or provide services from them.
Further, if a transporter wishes to use a plane, she or he must also have an air taxi operator's license; to transport hunters by boat, a license from the USCG is needed.
A licensed guide may act as a transporter in his or her own guide-use areas, but to take clients outside those areas, she or he must have a transporter license.
4.4.3 Guides in GMU 8
As of January 2001, there were 82 master guides and 498 registered guides in the state.
Of these, 39 guides were registered to guide in guide-use areas in GMU 8.
Guides may be registered in as many as three guide-use areas within the state, and several guides on the Kodiak archipelago have all three of their registered guide-use areas within GMU 8.
4.4.4 Guiding on the Kodiak National Wildlife Refuge
Guiding for both big-game hunts and sport fishing on the refuge is very complicated.
Guides must secure special-use permits from USFWS.
The fee for such a permit includes a flat administrative fee and a per client-use day charge for time spent in the field with the client.
Within the refuge, the guide-area boundaries of GMU 8 correspond with refuge permit areas.
(In addition to the 21 big-game guide areas on KNWR, portions of nine areas on state land on the archipelago are also open to registered guides.)
See Appendix D for a description of the big-game guide permitting process on KNWR. 4.4.5 Alaska Professional Hunters Association
The Alaska Professional Hunters Association (APHA) is an organization of professional guides in Alaska.
Members of APHA subscribe to a fair-chase code of ethics (see Appendix C for the APHA's Code of Ethics).
In the absence of the Guide Board, which was disbanded by the state legislature in 1994, APHA attempts to police its profession by ensuring that those who are convicted of violating state or federal laws regarding wildlife or the guiding profession cannot be members of APHA.

Alaska Native Big-Game Guides
Guiding brown-bear hunters has been an important economic and social activity for some individuals in every community on the Kodiak archipelago.
With the beginning of the brownbear expeditions in the early 1900s, professional hunters and guides, with their clientele, enlisted the help of Alutiiq hunters because of their local knowledge of weather, terrain, and bear habits.
These village hunters were employed as packers and guides, and many went on to become licensed as class-A or assistant guides.
Some worked toward acquiring registered guide licenses and established their own businesses.
Eli Metrokin was probably the first Alutiiq on Kodiak to receive his registered guide license.
He was followed in the late 1940sÂ­60s by Roy Madsen, Leonard Helgason, Nick Nekeferoff, and Larry Matfay.
A strong tradition of passing the interest in guiding bear hunters to the next generation is evidenced by the following Old Harbor family: Moses Naumoff trained his son-in-law Larry Matfay, who in turn trained Ralph Christiansen and his sons David and Wesley.
This extended family interest and involvement in guiding bear hunters continues today.
Leonard Helgason, with roots to Afognak village, was taught to hunt bears by "Uncle Bill" Baumann.
Leonard's son Steven received his registered guide license during the 1990s.
Nick Malutin and Griska Nicholi were the village hunters in Karluk village.
Both went on to guide extensively for Charlie Madsen.
Other well-respected Native bear guides were the Panamaroff brothers, Alex, Walter, and Lawrence; Johnny Aga; Frank Noya; Oscar Alpiak; William Ambrosia; Fred and Bill Kvasnikoff; and others.
All held class-A or assistant guide licenses and, over the years, have contributed a great deal to the character and uniqueness of the Kodiak bear-hunting experience.
Willie Eluska and Bill Agnot, from Akhiok, guided for many years for Bill Pinnell and Morris Talifson at Olga Bay, as did Minni and Ephriam Agnot to a lesser extent.
Herman Malutin, Jeff Peterson, Johnny Parker, and others are currently licensed as class-A assistant guides; David Christiansen was scheduled to take the registered guide licensing exam in winter 2001-2002.
Alaska Village Initiatives (AVI) has formed the Village Wildlife Conservation Cooperative (VWCC) for the purpose of providing rural land owners with education and advocacy on privateland wildlife-habitat management.
The VWCC will focus on the enhancement or recovery of subsistence and sport hunting wildlife from private lands and will provide assistance for eco-, adventure- and watchable-wildlife tourism.
As part of this effort, The VWCC is working with APHA to develop a cooperative approach to increasing the number of Native registered guides in the business and to dealing with access and trespass issues on private lands.
4.4.7 Â· Â· Â· Recommendations Relating to Guiding Strongly support the restrictive guide system currently in use on federal lands of the Kodiak archipelago and encourage reinstatement of this system on other lands.
Support the Alaska Board of Game resolution 98.127, 1998, (see Appendix R) requesting reinstatement of the Big-Game Commercial Services Board.
Encourage guides/outfitters and transporters to make bear-safety educational materials available to elk hunters.

Other Resource Extraction Sport Hunting
In addition to Kodiak bears, three primary big-game species are hunted on the Kodiak archipelago: Sitka black-tailed deer, Roosevelt elk, and mountain goats.
Goat hunting does not usually bring hunters into conflict with bears because fewer hunters are afield during hunting season (approximately 150 goat hunters compared to 4,000 deer hunters), the terrain in which goats are hunted is more open, and smaller amounts of meat from the kill are available for bears.
Deer hunting and elk hunting, however, present increased opportunities for bear-human interactions and DLP killing of bears (see section 6.2 for more information about DLPs).
4.5.1.1 Deer Hunting Sitka black-tailed deer populations on Kodiak Island reached peak numbers in the 1980s.
At that time, there were more than 100,000 of the animals on the island, and some 13,000 deer were taken by hunters each year.
The deer population in 2001 was down to approximately 40,000, and annual harvest was down to approximately 2,000 animals.
Deer occur throughout the Kodiak archipelago, and efforts are being made to rebuild the population after the severe decline in the late 1990s.
Seventy percent of the harvest is taken during November and December, 20 percent is taken in October, and the remaining 10 percent is taken during the rest of the hunting season (there are three hunting seasons).
At its spring 2001 meeting, the Alaska Board of Game changed state regulations to allow hunters to harvest a maximum of three deer (down from four) in GMU 8.
Federal subsistence regulations allow residents of GMU 8 to take deer on federal lands within the archipelago (except on the road system).
Subsistence harvest limits sometimes differ from state regulations.
Federal subsistence regulations on Kodiak only pertain to lands managed by USFWS; state, Native corporation, private, borough, and municipal lands are not included in these liberalized restrictions.
The impact of deer hunting on Kodiak bear behavior and mortality can be significant.
When there was a high level of deer hunting, there was an increase in the number of DLP mortalities of bears and requests to reduce deer hunting to protect bears.
4.5.1.2 Elk Hunting Roosevelt elk, which were introduced to Afognak Island in 1929, now occur on Kodiak, Afognak, and Raspberry islands.
In 1959, there were approximately 1,500 elk.
As of January 2001, there were about 900 animals.
Approximately 650 hunters come to Kodiak each year to hunt for elk.
In 1998, the Federal Subsistence Board opened a subsistence elk hunt September 1Â­25 on KNWR lands on northwestern Afognak Island, within the traditional range of the Waterfall elk herd.
In 1999, the season was liberalized to extend through November 30.
Hunters were limited to GMU 8 residents, and access was limited to marine waters only in 1998 and 1999.
In 2000, the access restriction was rescinded.

Kodiak Archipelago Bear Conservation and Management Plan
Many hunters are not familiar with hunting Roosevelt elk, the Pacific Northwest subspecies of elk that inhabit the northern portion of the Kodiak archipelago.
Roosevelt elk are larger than the more common subspecies (the Rocky Mountain elk), are generally difficult to hunt, and are often found in the most remote parts of the archipelago.
Successful hunters may be faced with transporting significant amounts of game meat over long distances or rough terrain without the aid of all-terrain vehicles or pack animals.
Several trips are required to salvage all of the meat of a large elk.
As a result, many elk hunters fail to salvage all of the meat.
Salvaging meat over the course of days has additional negative impacts because bears are frequently attracted to the kill sites in a short time.
Encounters between bears and hunters returning to the kill site or meat caches may result in DLP situations.
4.5.1.3 Recommendations about Sport Hunting Â· Urge ADF
Require mandatory hunter education, which should include bear-safety instruction, before going afield in GMU 8 (see chapter 8, "Education").
Encourage hunters to quickly remove kill meat to a safe distance from the kill site (see also chapter 8, "Education").

Recommend strongly that elk hunters hunt in groups or teams.
Limit the harvest of deer to the number of animals the hunter can handle.
Encourage hunters to promptly gut the harvested animal and move it to a safe, visible location.
Encourage hunters to store meat responsibly so it won't attract bears (e.g., high in trees, within electric fences); use of mini-electric fences is advised.
Encourage hunters to be aware of carcasses or gut piles from animals harvested by others.

Commercial Fishing
4.5.2
As well as being an important element of Kodiak bears' diet, salmon are the mainstay of Kodiak's commercial fishery.
The commercial fishery's Kodiak Management Area (KMA) encompasses waters surrounding the Kodiak archipelago.
The KMA comprises seven districts and 52 sections around the Kodiak archipelago and along the coast of the Alaska Peninsula that borders Shelikof Strait.
The KMA includes approximately 700 streams on the Kodiak archipelago in which salmon migration or spawning has been documented.
Figure 4-1 shows the canneries and sockeye enhancement, weir, and hatchery locations of the KMA in 2000.
The salmon resources of the KMA have been used commercially for more than 150 years by setnetters, gillnetters, and seiners (fish traps were outlawed in 1959, when Alaska gained statehood).
A limited entry system, initiated by the state in 1974, restricted the number of individuals allowed to participate in the commercial salmon fisheries.
This system formally established maximum numbers by specific gear type by area that could participate annually; it is administered by the Commercial Fisheries Entry Commission.
Currently, there are 608 commercial salmon permits for the KMA.
Commercial harvest limits are controlled by opening and closing fishing periods based on the achievement of escapement goals.
Because sport anglers, subsistence users, and Kodiak bears also share use of the salmon resources, it is imperative that escapements be closely monitored and managed to ensure that maximum production levels are maintained.
Biological escapement goals (BEG) set the number of spawning salmon required to sustain maximum production levels for each salmon species.
The KMA commercial salmon fisheries are managed to achieve escapement levels that are within the BEG range.
The majority of all sockeye and all chinook salmon escapement counts are obtained with the use of weirs, which have been used in as many as 18 different spawning systems.
The KMA staff issues subsistence salmon permits annually to obtain harvest data.
Only residents of the State of Alaska are eligible to take salmon for subsistence purposes.
With few restrictions, the entire KMA is open to subsistence salmon fishing.
Reported subsistence harvests have averaged more than 31,100 fish annually for the 10-year period 1991Â­2000.
Sockeye salmon accounts for more than 70 percent of that harvest.
In addition to state subsistence regulations, there are federal subsistence regulations that apply to the federal lands and waters located within the KMA. Alaskans who reside in the Kodiak Island Borough, except those residing on the U.S. Coast Guard Base, are qualified for participation in the federal subsistence fishery.

Commercial fishing and processing can account for as much as 55 percent of the private sector work force (according to 1991 figures) of the approximately 14,000 people who reside within the KMA.
During the commercial salmon fishing season (approximately June through September), as many as 5,000 people may be directly involved in harvesting, tendering, or processing.
A regional planning team (RPT) plans for the long-term future of the salmon resource within the region.
The RPT's primary responsibility is to initiate and continue an orderly process that examines the full potential of the region's salmon production capacity.
To accomplish this, the RPT develops a comprehensive salmon plan for the region it represents.
Phase II of the Kodiak Regional Comprehensive Salmon Plan 1982Â­2002 was developed by the Kodiak RPT in March 1992.
4.5.2.1 Recommendations Regarding Commercial Fishing Â· Salmon escapement goals should continue to allow for natural predation by bears and other wildlife (see Appendix F, "Principles and Criteria for Sustainable Salmon Fishing," and Appendix U, "Policy for Statewide Salmon Escapement Goals").
Continue evaluating species-specific salmon escapement levels against drainagespecific bear use of salmon; investigations should emphasize an ecosystem overview (e.g., salmon BEG rather than bear densities) (see chapter 3, "Kodiak Bear Habitat" and chapter 7, "Research and Monitoring").
Continue monitoring salmon escapement trend data and subsequent species-specific productivity; evaluate salmon harvest strategies for all human user groups.
(see Appendix F, "Principles and Criteria for Sustainable Salmon Fishing").
Sport Fishing

4.5.3
Sport-fishing activities are managed by ADF
Sport fish salmon harvest estimated for the Kodiak archipelago includes both guided and unguided angling.
Although the sport-fishing harvest is a relatively small percentage of the total return or harvest of salmon, from 1977 through 1998 an overall increasing trend was evident in the total number of salmon reported as harvested by anglers; this was due primarily to increases in the harvest of sockeye, chinook, and coho salmon.
Reported annual harvests have ranged from 327 to 5,221 chinook; 1,255 to 12, 505 sockeye; 4,716 to 29,456 coho; and 5,336 to 19,044 pink salmon.
Annual sport harvests of chum salmon are generally less than 1,000.
The primary conservation burden to ensure that salmon escapement goals are achieved is placed on the commercial net fisheries by means of in-season restrictions.
Additional restrictions have been placed on sport salmon fisheries along Kodiak Island's road system and, although it has not been necessary in the past, could be placed on additional system-specific sites as needed.
Approximately half of sport fishing on the Kodiak archipelago takes place in salt water, for halibut.
Of the remaining half, about 68 percent takes place in streams along the road system on northeastern Kodiak Island.
In 1999, anglers expended approximately 115,000 days of effort, of which less than 20,000 were spent in remote sport fishing.

Kodiak Archipelago Bear Conservation and Management Plan
It is with remote sport fishing, however, that most bear-human conflicts arise because of the extended presence of and camping by anglers in bear habitat.
Anecdotal information indicates that the two areas in which most problem interactions between bears and anglers occur are on the Karluk River, concentrated around the portage and fish weir area, and on the Ayakulik River, where Bare Creek connects with the Ayakulik River.
In these two areas, bears do not normally seek fish.
Except for food brought in by anglers and cleaned fish or fish carcasses, there is little reason for bears to remain in the area when humans are not present.
However, when many anglers are concentrated in an area for a period of time, they make available easy food for bears.
This convenient food supply draws bears to the sport-fishing sites and may result in bear-human conflicts.
Although efforts have been made to frighten bears away by shooting them with rubber bullets, such deterrents do not seem sufficient to keep the bears away from the easy food source.
Implementation of the CAC's recommendations (see section 4.5.3.1) to accommodate anglers (e.g., hardening campsites9, securing food storage, providing angler education) will likely solve many of the bear-human conflicts that have been occurring.
At the present time, Koniag, Inc., lands adjacent to the Karluk River are subject to a nondevelopment easement granted by Koniag.
The current agreement limits large-scale development and habitat alteration by Koniag on its land.
After October 15, 2002, a new conservation easement granted by Koniag will go into effect.
The most significant aspect of that easement is the agreement to limit the number of users of the uplands.
While the easement does not limit the subsistence use of the lands by the residents of Karluk and Larsen Bay, all other users, including subsistence users from other areas, will be subject to the terms of the easement.
Under the proposed easement, USFWS will conduct a study to determine the appropriate angler handling capacity of the river.
Until the study is completed, an interim level of use of 70 users per day would be in effect for the period June 10 through July 15.
All commercial use of the uplands is reserved to Koniag and its licensees.
The right of the general public to use the bottom of the Karluk River is presently disputed.
While the United States conveyed the Karluk River bottom to Koniag as part of its conveyances under Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act (ANCSA), the State of Alaska has asserted that it holds title to the river bottom.
Irrespective of the status of the river's bottom, at the present time, there is no fishing from or other permitted use of the uplands without the owner's permission.
While there are 17(b) easements near the river, by law their use is limited to travel-related use only, and they can not be used for fishing.
The location of these easements also precludes their use for fishing without trespassing on the private lands.

reduced the problems.
During the 1990s, on the Kodiak archipelago, anglers shot two bears in DLP situations.
Both of these incidents occurred on the Ayakulik River.
Although other DLP mortalities of bears may be attributed to anglers, they have not been recorded.
Kodiak National Wildlife Refuge did a three-year study in the early 1990s on the interaction of bears and humans along the Ayakulik River.
This study could not demonstrate any long-term harm to bears from the presence of anglers.
The Division of Sport Fish strives to provide a diversity of experience for anglers.
If anglers are elbow-to-elbow, the experience may not meet anyone's desires for quality.
The division is presently engaged in a study of what anglers want in terms of a quality experience on the Situk River, near Yakutat.
The Board of Fisheries has the authority to limit the harvest of fish but not the authority to reduce the number of anglers at any one place or time.
Guiding requirements for sport fishing are very different from those for big-game hunting; a sport-fishing guide has only to register with ADF
Sport-fishing guiding on the refuge, however, requires a special-use permit.
There are currently four drainages within the refuge (i.e., Ayakulik, Dog Salmon, Uganik, and Little River) that are under the refuge's prospectus system with a limited number of guided-use permits.

Harvest of Berries and Other Plants
4.5.4
Kodiak's lush vegetation provides critical habitat for bears, with sedges, forbs, roots, and berries being important seasonal food sources.
Bears share these resources with other animals, including humans, and in some isolated areas competition may result.
Vegetative resources are also subject to annual fluctuations of abundance.
This is most notable with berry crops, which may swing from absence to overabundance in consecutive years.
The archipelago's vegetation evolved without indigenous ungulates.
Grazing by cattle, deer, elk, and mountain goats in the past century has had a notable impact on some plant species and areas.
How these impacts affect bears or the long-term survival of the plants has yet to be thoroughly examined.
Berry crops have been harvested by people since the first Alutiit arrived on Kodiak more than 7,500 years ago.
Most human use of berries has been restricted to near coastal areas and probably has had little impact on the bear population.
Recent development of commercial markets for wild berries (e.g., wine and jelly production) may increase the demand for Kodiak berries.
No direct impacts on bears have yet been noted, but future effects, especially in years with reduced berry crops, will have to be monitored.

Regulation Enforcement
Enforcement of state game regulations, for both hunting and fishing, is handled by the Alaska Department of Public Safety, Division of Fish and Wildlife Protection officers, who are Alaska State Troopers.
Most big-game enforcement on the Kodiak archipelago is done from the air or by boat.
Basically, the officers check for resident or nonresident hunting licenses, make sure hunters have the required locking tags, ensure that the people who are hunting in a specific area have the permits to do so, and enforce meat-salvage requirements.

Redefining Bear-Management Strategy Synopsis: Management objectives for Kodiak archipelago bears currently are based on harvest figures.
ADF
At present, the total bear population on the Kodiak archipelago is stable and can be sustained at this high level by the natural habitat.
Habitat in different areas is capable of sustaining different bear densities.
Although the entire Kodiak archipelago is high-quality bear habitat, there are areas where human development and residence take precedence.
Thus, biological carrying capacity and wildlife-acceptance capacity may be different.
With this awareness, the Citizens Advisory Committee (CAC) recommends a shift in strategy to managing the bear population by density rather than by harvest alone.
To do this, biologists need accurate data on bear populations and habitat carrying capacities.
The CAC also recommends reducing, through liberalized sport-hunting seasons in the spring and issuance of appropriate depredation permits, the bear population along the road system of northeastern Kodiak Island by 10-20 percent below the current estimated level.
Current bear-management objectives are based on maintaining a population that can support certain harvest criteria.
Consequently, harvest data collection and analysis are important components of bear-management reports produced by the Alaska Department of Fish and Game (ADF

Since the Terror Lake hydroelectric project, however, increasing amounts of data on bears have been collected.

Redefining Bear-Management Strategy
Kodiak Archipelago Bear Conservation and Management Plan
At present, the total bear population on the Kodiak archipelago is stable and can be sustained at this high level (approximately 2,980 animals) by the natural habitat (see chapter 3 for detailed information about Kodiak bear habitat).
From 1990 through 1999, the population sustained an average annual hunter harvest of 160 bears, of which 69 percent were males.
Reported nonsport harvest (e.g., DLP, illegal, subsistence) has averaged 18 animals each year for the same time period.
Annual human-caused mortality (sport hunter and nonsport kills) have averaged approximately 6 percent of the estimated population.
As noted in chapter 6, section 6.2, however, the accuracy of the number of DLP kills is questionable.
5.2 Biological Carrying Capacity
Habitat in different areas of the Kodiak archipelago is capable of sustaining different bear densities.
For example, southern Kodiak Island (made up primarily of KNWR and having the largest sockeye salmon systems) has the highest-quality bear habitat.
Northeastern Kodiak Island, on the other hand, has the least suitable habitat because of high concentrations of humans, large tracts of agricultural land and private property, and smaller salmon systems.
In the late 1990s,.
ADF
(The current high population of Kodiak bears on the archipelago is assumed to be appropriate to the high end of the biological carrying capacity of bear habitat.)
A high cycle in Alaska salmon productivity has been documented during the past 20 years.
The current high population of bears on the Kodiak archipelago may reflect this cyclic high in salmon productivity.
Fisheries researchers are just beginning to understand natural cycles and long-term regime shifts in the North Pacific Ocean.
These shifts in the ocean environment cause significant changes in salmon populations and fluctuations in the availability of other near-shore species used as food sources by bears.
Depending on how strongly bear population density is linked to salmon population strength or weakness, ocean regime shifts may determine bear population ranges and should be factored into a proposed bear-density management strategy.

5.3
Wildlife-Acceptance Capacity
While biological carrying capacity refers to habitat that fulfills the requirements of bears, wildlife-acceptance capacity refers to fulfilling the needs and desires of human populations living in bear habitat.
Human development (e.g., communities, agricultural activities) in bear habitat result in increased interactions between bears and humans.
The entire Kodiak archipelago is high-quality bear habitat in many respects.
But there are areas--for example, the Buskin River area--where humans are living in this high-quality bear habitat.
Thus, biological carrying capacity and wildlife-acceptance capacity may be different, and the fact that there are places where people have to exist with bears needs to be acknowledged.
Although residents of the Kodiak archipelago are proud of their bears, they also recognize needs for lower numbers of bears in areas where interaction between bears and humans is either undesirable or could prove detrimental to human safety and might result in DLP mortality of bears.
People have made conscious decisions to limit the number of bears on certain portions of the archipelago, particularly on the Kodiak road system.
Kodiak National Wildlife Refuge, however, was established to protect bears and their natural habitat, and that will remain its purpose.
Just as food is a focus in assessing biological carrying capacity of bear habitat, human safety is a focus when determining the wildlife-acceptance capacity for bears in an area.
Thus, it is important to consider the needs and desires of numerous entities--the bears themselves, various recreational and subsistence users, other animals sharing the habitat, and the human residents--when making management decisions regarding the desired level of bear density in given areas of the archipelago.
5.4 Bear-Management Strategy on the Kodiak Archipelago
With awareness of bear habitat's biological carrying capacity and also the wildlifeacceptance capacity of the bear-management subunits within GMU 8 (the Kodiak archipelago), the CAC wishes to promote a strategy of bear-management objectives based on bear densities in various habitat areas as well as on harvest numbers.
More than two decades of conservative hunting seasons and abundant food resources have brought the Kodiak bear population to an overall density that is probably near biological carrying capacity of the habitat.
In an effort to maintain the population at its maximum sustainable yield, the CAC proposes to manage most of the archipelago at or slightly below (10 percent) the current estimated density, as shown in Table 5-2.
These targets should recognize natural fluctuations in cub production (and statistical limitations of available procedures).
They should also be reevaluated if significant natural changes in habitat (e.g., climatic shifts) are detected (see section 5.2 regarding ocean regime shifts and fluctuations in salmon populations).
On northeastern Kodiak Island--which includes the Kodiak road system (area 30 in management subunit # 2 on Figure 5-1); most of the livestock ranches; and the vast majority of the human population--the CAC believes a reduction in bear density is appropriate.
Reducing the current population of bears occupying that area by 10Â­20 percent below current estimates

would help reduce negative bear-human interactions.
Such a reduction is consistent with agreements that established KNWR in 1941 and is in keeping with the ADF
Reductions would be made by liberalizing sport-hunting seasons in the spring and by issuing depredation permits when appropriate (see footnote 16 on page 6-17 for information about depredation permits).
If bear populations in the area were to drop below the target level, appropriate actions to reduce harvests would be taken.
While the CAC is recommending this shift in strategy to managing the bear population by density rather than by harvest alone, it recognizes that bear population numbers must be as accurate as possible.
ADF
Once new population figures have been established, the density numbers presented in Table 5-2 should be adjusted and management plans adapted accordingly.

Bear-Human Interactions Synopsis: Bears and humans have inhabited the Kodiak archipelago for more than 7,000 years.
As the human population expands, however, and there is increasing human activity in areas once considered bear habitat, the potential for bear-human interactions also increases.
These interactions can be positive for humans or they can have negative impact, sometimes with dangerous consequences that could result in human or bear mortality.
This chapter looks at habituation and food-conditioning of bears by humans, bear mortality in defense of life or property, and a number of circumstances in which humans and bears are coming or will increasingly come in contact.
These include solid-waste management, storage of human and pet food, livestock ranching, remote cabins, and bear-viewing opportunities.
The last of theseÂ­bear viewingÂ­was perhaps the single most complicated issue discussed by the Citizens Advisory Committee (CAC).
For each situation, the CAC makes recommendations to avoid negative bear-human interactions and to protect Kodiak bears and their habitat.
Over centuries, bears and humans have co-existed successfully on the Kodiak archipelago.
As the human population expands, however, and there is increasing human activity in areas once considered bear habitat, the potential for bear-human interactions also increases.
These interactions can be positive for humans, as with the pleasure derived from bear viewing, or they can have negative impacts and result in dangerous situations, which sometimes result in human or, more likely, bear mortality.
As human presence in bear habitat becomes more common, bears can become accustomed to that presence.
The level and nature of this habituation of bears to humans and their activities can determine the type of impact to bears and humans alike.
This chapter discusses habituation of bears by humans and then looks at a variety of situations in which bears and humans interact: Â· Â· Â· Â· Â· Â· Â· bear mortality in defense of life or property (section 6.2) solid-waste management and storage of human and pet food (section 6.3) livestock ranching (section 6.4). bear-viewing activities (section 6.6) use of aircraft (section 6.7) public-use and remote cabins (section 6.8) other recreational activities (section 6.9)

Bear-Human Interactions
6.1
Habituation and Food-Conditioning of Bears by Humans
Habituation of bears is of concern to archipelago residents, resource managers, hunters, and recreationists.
A generally accepted definition of habituation is "an absence of response (from bears) that comes about after repeated, benign interactions with humans."
Habituation in and of itself does not result in "bad" bears.
Neutral habituation is an acceptable process at several world-class viewing areas such as McNeil River, Pack Creek, and Anan Creek.
Neutrally conditioned bears neither avoid humans nor actively seek them or their property.
At least one study indicates that habituation of females with cubs reduces incidents of fearinduced bear attacks on humans (Jope 1985).
Evidence indicates that maternal females and subadults are more likely to habituate than are adult males.
Irregular occurrences of human activity in remote sites seldom lead to habituation, of bears but may displace or disturb bears in their use of that habitat.
Food-conditioning is a behavior learned when a bear receives food, fish, or garbage from people.
This is undesirable behavior that may result in property loss or damage, human injury, or defense of life or property (DLP) mortality of bears.
Repeated negative encounters between bears and humans could prove stressful to bears and, in the case of food-conditioned bears, could create a significant danger to humans.
It can be anticipated that many more bear-human interactions, especially bear shootings in DLP, will occur if the number of food-conditioned bears increases on the archipelago.
6.1.1 Â· Recommendations about Habituation and Food-Conditioning of Kodiak Bears To understand human habituation and its effects on bears, ADF
Enforce regulations prohibiting the feeding of food, garbage, or fish to bears.
Provide education to prevent food conditioning of bears by humans (see also chapter 8, "Education").
Â· Â· 6.2
Bear Mortality in Defense of Life or Property
Alaska state law allows anyone to kill a bear to defend life or property (5 AAC12 92.410, Appendix I).
For a bear to be legally killed under this provision, the person must demonstrate that he or she did not unreasonably invade a bear's habitat, provoke an attack, or cause a problem by leaving food or garbage lying around.
Prior to killing the bear, the person must take every practical, nonlethal means to protect life or property.
For the purposes of this provision, property means a person's dwelling, means of travel, pets, or other valuable property necessary for livelihood or survival.
If a bear is killed in DLP, the person is required to remove the hide

(including claws) and the skull and give them to the Alaska Department of Fish 
Meat will be donated to anyone who wants it.
The person who kills the bear must also notify ADF
The DLP provision was included in Alaska law in 1926.
It has gone through a number of revisions, but the basic premises remain the same: Â· First, and foremost, it gives people the right to defend themselves from bears.
This is especially important in a state such as Alaska where self-reliance is a cherished and necessary part of daily life, especially in remote areas.
Second, the provision seeks to protect bears from unnecessary persecution.
The person has a responsibility to do everything possible to avoid lethal action.
The bear must be taken while it is in the act of causing a problem and cannot be hunted down or baited.
Third, the provision accommodates the needs of wildlife managers.
Requiring prompt notification of authorities, a written report, and surrender of the hide and skull allows managers to gather information on the sex and age of the bear and the circumstances of the kill.
Recovery of the hide and skull also acts as a deterrent for unnecessary kills and reduces opportunities to profit from the illegal sale of bear parts.
Â·
Â·
Unfortunately, the strict stipulations of the provision sometimes deter people from reporting DLP mortalities of bears.
ADF
Reporting rates vary by year and by user group.
The most common reason for not reporting DLP bear kills is fear of prosecution.
People are either unaware of the provisions of the law or are concerned about their proper compliance with the law.
Another reason given for not reporting DLPs is the inability or refusal to skin the bear and remove its skull.
Lack of complete information, because of unreported DLP mortalities, is hampering wildlife biologists' ability to make complete assessments of human impacts on the bear population and to understand various human uses of bears on the archipelago.
6.2.1 Â· Â· Â· Recommendations Relating to Defense of Life or Property Kills Continue to follow state regulations regarding bears killed in DLP.
The Kodiak Fish and Game Advisory Committee should propose a change in state hunting regulations to establish and authorize use of depredation permits.13 ADF
These permits should be issued only after reasonable, nonlethal methods to deal with problem bears have been exhausted.
Conduct research and monitoring to evaluate the effectiveness of depredation permits (see also chapter 7, "Research and Monitoring").
Â·
13
Depredation permits would be issued to an individual, to allow killing of a problem bear, in a specific incident and would only be available after careful consideration by ADF
Reporting and salvage requirements would be the same as under the DLP provisions.

Â·
6.3
Solid-Waste Management and Storage of Human and Pet Food
Bears spend much of their time seeking food to replenish fat reserves between denning periods.
This need, coupled with their high levels of strength and intelligence, makes bears effective predators and scavengers.
Concentrated food sources, be they natural (e.g., salmon streams, tide flats, or berry patches) or human-made (e.g., dumps, landfills), are especially attractive, and bears often develop creative means of utilizing these resources.
They also develop complex social structures and communication skills while in close proximity to other bears that have also been attracted to feeding sites.
Bear concentrations at natural feeding sites are essential elements of a healthy bear population.
They are indications that bears are taking advantage of high-quality food sources, and they allow people to observe bear behaviors and learn about them.
Bear concentrations at human-made feeding sites, however, have been shown to increase undesirable bear-human encounters.
As late as the 1940s, bear viewing at dumps was a sanctioned activity at many U.S. national parks.
At Yellowstone National Park, bleachers were erected near the dump, and rangers gave informative lectures each day.
In 1903, Theodore Roosevelt noted that tourists were as interested in the bear shows as they were interested in the geysers.
Bear populations increased as a result of the open dumps, and rough estimates of the park's grizzly population amplified from 40 in 1920 to 260 by 1933.
Unfortunately, along with this increase came a commensurate increase in bearhuman encounters as the bears began to equate human habitations--be they tents, cars, or cafeterias--with places to find a meal.
In 1960, the National Park Service curtailed the practice of feeding bears at the dumps and prohibited visitors from loitering in the vicinity of the dumps.
In the early 1970s, dumps were closed completely, and many bears were killed as they responded to the closures by becoming more aggressive in their attempts to procure human food and garbage.
Similar situations continue to this day throughout North America.
Even though the lessons learned at Yellowstone are still valid, the temptation to have a reliable place to see bears prompts some individuals or communities to dispose of their garbage in locations where bears can easily get to it.
It is also easier and cheaper in the short term to throw waste in a centralized location with no fencing or coverage.
Federal and state regulations prohibit such disposal, but
March 8, 2002
page 6-5
6.
Bear-Human Interactions
Kodiak Archipelago Bear Conservation and Management Plan
enforcement of those regulations is often times lax.
Bears using unregulated dumps may have higher productivity than other bears, but they are subject to increased exposure to toxins and physical threats.
Individual bears may also gain access to human foods by raiding homes or camps.
Household garbage and pet food are frequently stored in unsecured areas near homes.
Bears living in the vicinity of these homes may be tempted by the smell of these items and may investigate.
The same scenario might also develop with fish-drying racks, game hanging near camps, or food or fish left in camps.
If bears are rewarded for their curiosity by obtaining food, they usually become bolder in their efforts to get food from human sources.
These efforts may result in destruction of property or life-threatening situations.
Frequently, the bears involved are killed.
The CAC recognizes that it is undesirable for bears to obtain food from any kind of human source (see section 6.1 for more on food-conditioning) and that it is more effective to prevent bears from getting food or garbage initially than it is to re-educate them once food or garbage has already been obtained.
Translocation (moving bears to a new area) is seldom an effective solution.
Bears have a proved ability to return to home ranges from long distances and over rugged terrain.
Those that do not return are likely to continue to be involved in bear-human conflicts in new locations.
Although translocation is often preferred by the public, because of its demonstrated ineffectiveness, human safety concerns, and the high expense, it is generally inappropriate to spend time and funds on such efforts (see also Appendix O).
Bear-human interactions are a communitywide concern.
This issue cannot be viewed as a "Fish and Game problem" or as "the refuge's bears," or as something that "the troopers have to do something about."
Everyone in the community, visitor and resident alike, is an integral part of the problem and of the solution.
To instill this critical concept, public officials have an obligation to educate the public about bear behavior, the current situation, and the best available courses of action.
The CAC recognizes that a community-based, multifaceted approach has been successful in reducing bear-human encounters along the Kodiak road system in recent years.
Continuation and refinement of that program, with efforts to expand it, with appropriate modifications, to villages, lodges, and remote cabins will be more effective in reducing bear-human conflicts than will translocation of "problem" bears.
6.3.1 Landfill Management
Public landfills and dumps are the most readily accessible source of human food for bears.
Management of these areas will impact bear-human encounters tremendously.
Although it is impossible to bear-proof a solid-waste facility, there are effective techniques to make them much less attractive to bears.
The residents of the Kodiak Island Borough (KIB) have made a commitment to keep bears out of their landfill.
In July 1998, an electric fence surrounding the borough landfill near Monashka Bay was completed and energized.
Vegetative cover within the fence was removed, and garbage is covered often, thus drastically reducing the attractiveness of the site to bears.
page 6-6 March 8, 2002
Kodiak Archipelago Bear Conservation and Management Plan
6.
Bear-Human Interactions
Initially, a few bears tested the fence and learned to dig under it, but borough staff have been able to identify the weak areas of the fencing and reinforce them.
Prior to these landfillmanagement efforts, as many as 12 bears frequented the site; in 2000, no bears were observed within the fence.
Other landfills on the archipelago have not received the level of financial and community commitment that KIB's landfill has.
Efforts have been made, however, to move landfills and dumps away from village centers and to fence them.
In some cases, incineration has been attempted, but with limited success.
No electric fences have been erected (other than in Ouzinkie), and brush remains adjacent to most sites.
The CAC has specifically identified the Larsen Bay solid-waste disposal site as an area that deserves immediate attention.
6.3.1.1 Recommendations about Landfill Management Â· Â· Encourage KIB and individual communities to develop community-specific wastemanagement plans that include implementation and funding strategies.
Encourage village governments to seek federal, state, and local funding such that village landfills can meet federal standards and Alaska Department of Environmental Conservation (DEC) regulations and such that those regulations can be enforced at solid-waste disposal sites, thereby reducing their attractiveness to bears.
Request the State of Alaska to increase funding for the Revenue Sharing/Safe Communities programs, which would provide additional funding to small city governments (see also section 6.3.1.2).
Encourage cities to utilize additional funding for employment of electric fencing, incineration, and bulldozers for regular and frequent covering of garbage at landfills (see also section 6.3.1.2).
Enforce DEC regulations at dump sites, thereby reducing their attractiveness to bears.
Enforce existing landfill regulations from the federal government and for DEC.
Distribute the ADF
Encourage owners of remote cabins and lodges to use properly managed public landfills whenever possible; when private solid-waste disposal sites are necessary, encourage landowners to work with wildlife managers to devise appropriate ways to minimize bear encounters.
Prohibit, by borough or other local ordinance, bear viewing at solid-waste disposal sites.
Clear areas adjacent to landfills of trees, brush, and tall grass that can serve as cover for bears (the distance to be cleared depends on the terrain and habitat of the area and should be determined with assistance of wildlife managers).

Â·
Cover landfills often and thoroughly, keeping the active area of waste deposition minimal (at sites where bears are frequent visitors, increased covering and/or compaction of garbage will reduce the area in which bears can search for food; as that active area of garbage gets smaller, competition among bears increases, and subdominant bears opt to find other food sources).
Encourage recycling programs to reduce the amount of waste deposited in landfills.
If possible, use incineration to reduce space necessary for landfills and to reduce odors and food sources.
Install electric fencing around a landfill after the site has been cleared and bear numbers have declined through reduction of active areas.
(Electric fences should be welldesigned to suit the needs of individual sites and maintained by qualified personnel.
Periodic inspections should be scheduled to look for damaged portions of the fences, to remove debris from the fences, and to look for places where bears have tried to burrow under the fences.
The fences should remain electrified at all times except during maintenance.)
Install safe, effective, and easy-to-operate gates (self-closing, if possible) at each landfill and make specific individuals responsible for ensuring that gates remain closed.
Prior to erecting an electric fence, and immediately after it is up and running, inform residents of the program and the fact that some bears will be displaced (Appendix M).
(Note that an increase in bear-human encounters can be expected for the first couple of years the fence is operating.)
Encourage wildlife managers, residents, and civil officials to work together to devise improvements to keep bears out if they continue to gain access to properly designed landfills.

6.3.1.2 Larsen Bay Solid-Waste Management14 One of the most challenging situations currently on the Kodiak archipelago is the management of Larsen Bay's solid-waste disposal site.
A number of circumstances make this site stand out as an area that needs to be addressed to minimize the harmful effects on bears and to reduce the level of negative bear-human interaction for which Larsen Bay has become known.
Larsen Bay is located in a high-density area for bears and is home to one of the largest salmon canneries on Kodiak.
During the summer months, the human population swells with cannery workers and fishermen.
The amount of waste increases as well; it is taken to a waste site on a hill overlooking the city.
This area is surrounded by alder and thick brush that allow bears to move freely in and out of the waste site in relative security.
Very often, garbage is simply left lying on the ground and has become a great attractant to bears that roam the area.
Over the past few summers, the number of bears that have been food-conditioned at Larsen Bay's solid-waste disposal site has grown to more than 15.
As a result, the site has become a popular bear-viewing area.
Several sport fishing and hunting lodges have also opened in the last 14
The CAC identified this issue as being of current concern and one for which the CAC is making recommendations for immediate action.

few years, increasing the number of people who frequent the community.
The dump, where large numbers of bears can be viewed from vehicles, has been a popular stop for many of the lodges' clients.
While lodge owners enjoy the benefit of predictable bear viewing, other residents are less enthusiastic.
After the cannery closes in early September, less garbage is available, and bears begin to move into the city and around the cannery buildings.
This frequently results in bears destroying property and an increase of DLP mortalities.
As the days become shorter and children go back to school, issues of safety become a concern.
Steps need to be taken to reduce the number of bears that are habituated to humans at Larsen Bay's solid-waste disposal site.
These bears pose a threat to the bear viewers themselves, who often have no background or knowledge of Kodiak bears.
The diet of garbage the bears live on can be harmful for the bears, and the learned behavior (associating people with food) these bears acquire frequently leads to the destruction of property or destruction of bears.
Funding for remediation of this situation is, of course, always an issue, and Larsen Bay is no exception.
Kodiak Salmon Packers pays a fee to the city for the garage it takes to the site, but this is not sufficient to do all that is necessary to solve the problem.
6.3.1.3 Recommendations Regarding Larsen Bay Solid-Waste Disposal Site Â· Remediate the Larsen Bay solid-waste site situation in a stair-step approach: Â§ Â§ Â§ Â· Â· Â· 6.3.2 Clear the area around the waste site of alders and brush to create a barren zone to make the bears uncomfortable Quickly bury the garbage.
Construct an electric fence around the sited and a with means restricting access to the site.

On-Site Food Storage and Waste Management
Storage of food and solid waste near human habitations can bring bears literally face-to-face with people where they live.
Bears may be attracted to odors, or they may chance upon human food while transiting an area.
HumanÂ­food-conditioned bears that habitually forage at dumps are notoriously persistent in their attempts to get food from people.
If proper solid-waste site management techniques are used to keep bears out of these facilities, bears may initially be more tempted to seek human food from nearby residences or camps.

Potential increases in bear problems can be reduced by weaning bears from their bad habits before completely closing off access to landfills.
At solid-waste disposal sites in which bears are frequent visitors, increased covering and/or compaction of garbage will reduce the active area where bears can search for food.
As the active area of garbage gets smaller, competition among bears increases, and subdominant bears opt to find other food sources.
An essential part of reducing bear access to garbage is securing access to these food sources at garbage-collection sites.
Along rural areas of the Kodiak road system and at the U.S. Coast Guard (USCG) base, bear-resistant dumpsters are used from April through December.
These dumpsters are all metal, have doors that cannot be opened by bears, and are compatible with existing collection equipment.
Dumpsters are placed away from natural food sources (salmon streams), brush, and school-bus stops.
USCG has taken additional steps by putting all dumpsters in open, lighted, centralized locations away from residences and posting bear-safety information at each site.
Alaska State Parks has removed all open garbage cans in its park units and replaced them with bear-resistant dumpsters and will be installing additional bear-resistant garbage cans and food storage lockers in three popular camping areas in 2002.
Public outreach programs urging residents to ensure that garbage and food near their homes are secured from bears is another essential element in convincing bears to use natural foods.
In the City of Kodiak, people are educated to keep garbage and pet foods indoors and to work with neighbors to ensure that there are no bear attractants in their areas.
In addition, local police and state troopers enforce state laws prohibiting feeding bears and littering (13 AAC15 02.530 and 5 AAC 92.230) (see Appendix P).
The CAC recognizes that it is undesirable for bears to obtain food of any kind from human sources (see section 6.1) and that it is more effective to prevent bears from getting food or garbage initially than it is to re-educate them once food has already been obtained.
A community-based, multi-faceted approach has been successful at reducing bear-human encounters along the Kodiak road system in recent years, and the CAC encourages continuation and refinement of that program.
Efforts should also be made to expand the program, with appropriate modifications, to villages, lodges, and cabins.
The policies established to minimize bear access to human food and solid waste must include components dealing with public education, landfill management, and on-site storage.
The CAC also recognizes that funding from local, state, and federal sources should be sought as soon as possible to implement appropriate landfill improvements.
When applying for grants, applicants should work with wildlife managers to reference all appropriate research that has already been done regarding bears and solid-waste management.
Reference of these studies and management experiences can serve to expedite grant approval and subsequent action.
The waste-management program of the Kodiak Island Borough should be developed as a blueprint example of how to keep bears out of landfills.

6.3.2.1 Recommendations about Food Storage and Solid-Waste Management Â· Â· Â· Â· Develop better regulations and enforcement regarding food, garbage, and fish-handling in bear areas.
Vigorously enforce littering laws and regulations prohibiting feeding of bears.
Encourage residents to work within their neighborhoods to identify and correct potential problem areas that attract bears.
Encourage residents to keep garbage in enclosed areas and to empty garbage often during the summer months.
Plastic trash bags should be used to line garbage cans, and cans should be washed periodically.
Encourage residents to store pet and domestic livestock food indoors (if pets are fed outdoors, care should be taken to only provide the amount of food that can be eaten within an hour).
Encourage residents to house pets and domestic livestock in bear-resistant enclosures when not attended (electric fencing is an effective and inexpensive tool for separating bears and livestock).
Remove trees, brush, and grass that can serve as cover for bears near residences, bus stops, playgrounds, garbage-storage areas, and pet or livestock pens.
Ensure that residents have access to information on how to use noise-makers and lighting to chase bears from their yards; rubber bullets, bean-bag shells, and pepper spray are also effective, but should only be used by trained operators (prior to using any deterrents, all potential food sources should be removed from the area).
Use bear-resistant dumpsters (all metal, designed in existing collection equipment, relatively easy to use self-closing lids) wherever there is dumpster service coordination with waste-management contractors is a manner that is compatible with by most people, and preferably with on Kodiak Island; close essential.

Locate dumpsters as far as possible from school-bus stops and other places where children congregate; do not place dumpsters near natural food sources (such as salmon streams) or domestic livestock; brush-clearing and lighting near dumpsters are desirable.
Establish appropriate collection schedules to ensure that dumpsters do not become overly full.
Encourage KIB to monitor waste-collection schedules and take appropriate action, as needed.
If there are persistent bear problems in an area, temporarily remove the dumpster; if it is removed, a sign should be placed at the site to inform residents of when it was removed, why it was removed, where it was taken, and when it is expected to be returned.
In villages, assign specific individuals to provide collection services (e.g., emptying dumpsters, if appropriate); these individuals should receive adequate compensation for their duties and should be held accountable for their performance.

Encourage everyone using remote areas to remove all solid waste from the area (i.e., pack it in and pack it out) (see also chapter 8, "Education").
As soon as possible, seek funding from local, state, and federal sources to implement appropriate solid-waste management improvements (KIB should be made a blueprint example of how to keep bears from getting food or garbage from areas of human habitat).
Recognize the following groups for their efforts to reduce bear-human encounters around Kodiak and encourage continuation and expansion of these activities: - fish processors for collecting garbage from setnet sites - air-taxi operators for taking out garbage for campers, hunters, and anglers - logging camps on Afognak and remote cannery operators for developing effective waste-management techniques - Alaska State Parks and Kodiak National Wildlife Refuge for developing and enforcing waste-management policies at remote cabins - Kodiak Island Borough and the U.S. Coast Guard for taking leadership roles in establishing effective solid-waste management techniques on the Kodiak road system
Â·
Â·
To minimize bear problems, educate people about handling personal property, including chicken pens, drying sheds, food-storage areas, and pet food (see also chapter 8, "Education").
Develop an intergovernmental working group composed of representatives from wildlife management agencies (ADF
The working group should meet at least once each spring to review current policies to reduce bear-human encounters and to coordinate efforts for the upcoming year (see also chapter 8, "Education").
Establish lines of communication among agencies with various areas of responsibility (Appendix J provides an example of how bear reports on the Kodiak road system are handled) (also see chapter 8, "Education").
Provide public information on actions planned by the intergovernmental working group and encourage public input and questions regarding those actions (see also chapter 8, "Education").
Make available public information in a variety of media, including print, radio, public television, and personal appearances; attempt to meet the special needs of various cultures and ethnic groups (see also chapter 8, "Education").
Make the public outreach program ongoing, with emphasis on bear behavior and suggestions on how to minimize negative bear-human interactions (see Appendix K) (comparisons of bear behavior around food and garbage to dog behavior in similar situations can be helpful in improving understanding).

Advertise laws and regulations relating to leaving food or garbage in a manner that attracts wildlife (see also chapter 8, "Education").
Encourage agencies to disclose management actions such as moving dumpsters, citing individuals for littering, aversive conditioning of bears, and lethal actions against problem bears (all actions relating to bear-human interactions are matters of public record).
Encourage the public to report to authorities observations of bears near human habitations (these observations can help to track the activities of individual bears and allow managers to alert school principals and residents of areas in which to be especially cautious; observations should not be advertised to the general public, however, to minimize peoples' seeking out bears) (see also chapter 8, "Education").
Disseminate to the public information about ADF
Locate on-site bear safety reminders on dumpsters (e.g., "Be Bear Aware") and at collections sites (i.e., public landfills) (see also chapter 8, "Education").
Ensure that visitors are made aware of the efforts to keep bears away from human food and garbage; responsibilities of visitors should be outlined and disseminated so that they recognize their role in preventing problems (see also chapter 8, "Education").

6.4
Bears and Livestock Ranching
Russians brought the first livestock to Kodiak soon after their arrival, and by the late 1790s, cattle, sheep, goats, and pigs were common assets at settlement sites.
Cattle numbers varied through the 1800s, but continued to increase.
Kodiak's luxuriant grasslands tempted more and more ranchers, and in 1906, the U.S. Department of Agriculture established an experimental station in Kodiak to refine cattle breeds and to develop methods to take advantage of the seemingly limitless range.
In March 1939, the Alaska Game Commission sent wildlife agents to Kodiak to kill all bears seen in the proximity of any cattle range.
The intention was to reduce bear numbers within the cattle area and to remove them whenever possible as a potential menace to livestock.
From May 1964 through June 1965, ADF
They also actively pursued and killed all bears suspected of being cattle killers.
Ranchers appreciated the efforts, but sportsmen were outraged.
In spite of the concerns, the department continued its involvement in dispatching problem bears and attempted to capture and move some bears.
In November 1970, the department reevaluated its role in bear management on Kodiak, and the director of the Game Division wrote
March 8, 2002
page 6-13

Bear-Human Interactions
Kodiak Archipelago Bear Conservation and Management Plan
The following shall be the Department's policy concerning predation of cattle by bear: Â· Â· The Department shall not participate in bear depredation programs designed to alleviate cattle losses.
The person suffering these losses may take bears in defense of life or property . . . .
Under no circumstances may bears be shot from airplanes or taken by means of any poisonous substance.
That section of the regulations pertaining to immediate notification of the Alaska Department of Fish and Game upon taking a bear and to written documentation and salvaging of the hide will be strictly enforced.
The Department will make every effort to keep sport hunting regulations liberal to make possible the effective removal of bears by hunters.
Â·
Â·
This policy reiterated decisions made 30 years earlier by the Alaska Game Commission and appeared to close a long chapter in the relationship among cattlemen, government agents, and Kodiak bears.
Ranchers were understandably upset with the decision, however, and they continued to devise creative ways to protect their livestock without government intervention.
Today livestock ranching remains an important and viable industry on Kodiak and adjacent islands.
The largest herds occur on three leases on northeastern Kodiak Island (see Figure 6-2) and on separate leases on Sitkinak and Chirikof islands, where bears are not a problem.
The Kodiak Island leases encompass about 100,000 acres of state land and are used by approximately 300 cattle and 400 bison.
Ranchers lease grazing rights from the Alaska Department of Natural Resources and work in close cooperation with the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) Natural Resources Conservation Service to create and implement conservation plans that include stocking rates, range rotation plans, and fencing plans.
These conservation plans ensure that both upland and riparian areas are used wisely and are protected.
Although fencing is not required by the conditions of the leases, ranchers are encouraged to fence to minimize bear encounters, especially along riparian areas.
Land leased for grazing remains open to public access, per 11 AAC 58.800: "The lawful pursuit of the hunting of game, the taking of fish and trapping, or picking of berries shall not be denied on lands leased for agricultural or grazing purposes."
However, when requested in writing, the director of the Department of Natural Resources can grant permission that all or a portion of the lessee's premises may be posted wherever necessary to protect the lessee and property.
Ranchers have learned ways to live with bears on their leased lands, and bears are not as great a problem as they were 40 years ago.
Bison have proved to be less susceptible to bear predation, and electric fences are successfully used to protect livestock in select areas.
Ranchers may also take advantage of federal grants to improve fencing to reduce bear predation.
Individual bears do, however, continue to cause problems either through direct predation or by

moving cattle away from preferred ranges.
On northeastern Kodiak Island, the primary tools to reduce bear-cattle conflicts remain a liberal sport hunting season and the DLP provisions.
The CAC also examined the effects of grazing on bear habitat.
Conservation plans address issues of overgrazing with conditions regarding stocking rates and range rotation.
Although ranchers may wish to implement controlled burns to increase grass production for grazing purposes, state law (11 AAC 58.710) addresses the issue of grazing lessees using fire: "Lessee will take all reasonable precautions to prevent, and take necessary action to suppress, destructive or uncontrolled fires within the leased premises."
6.4.1 Farm Elk and Deer Propagation
Although there are no problems at this time (i.e., January 2002), there is concern about the possible effects to Kodiak wildlife of certain diseases among cattle that could be communicated by farm elk and deer.
It is possible that chronic wasting disease (related to spongiform encephalopathy), now occurring in captive elk herds in the Lower 48 states and Canada, could pass to wild deer or elk populations on the archipelago, with any resultant severe decline affecting bears.
The possible transmittal of said disease to bears in unknown.
6.4.2 Â· Â· Â· Recommendations Regarding Livestock Ranching Support the KIB Commercial Grazing and Conservation Zoning Plan.
Encourage ranchers to continue practices that minimize bear predation.
Recognizing the seriousness of foot and mouth disease and chronic wasting disease, the state should continue research about them and develop strategies to prevent their occurrence in Alaska.

Compensation for Property Loss compensated, by bears.
Alaska, however, for state reimbursement property.
In several western states under certain circumstances, cattlemen are interest groups such as Defenders of Wildlife, for cattle killed by grizzly has never authorized similar compensation.

6.5.1
Recommendation Regarding Compensation for Property Loss
While the CAC recognized that depredation of livestock and damage to personal property can be a significant loss to individuals, the group agreed that awarding compensation would be complicated by difficulty in verifying if the animal had actually been killed by a bear versus a bear scavenging on an animal that died from other causes; difficulty in determining if the property owner had taken necessary steps to minimize bear damage (e.g., used fencing, cleared brush around fish-drying sheds); difficulty in securing a source for funding; and the fact that, if depredation of livestock were related to overpopulation of bears in an area, it would be important that the population be stabilized before compensating for any loss.
The group decided that the institution of depredation permits,16 coupled with education about minimizing problems with bears, was more appropriate than seeking compensation for property loss at this time.
6.6 Bear-Viewing Activities
Bear viewing on the Kodiak archipelago is a recognized, legitimate activity, as are hunting, angling, boating, hiking, weir operations, and camping, and also occurs incidental to these activities.
The demand for wildlife viewing as a primary activity is significant and expected to increase.
The impact wildlife viewing has on tourism-related businesses is significant.
The Kodiak Island Convention and Visitors' Bureau (KICVB) reports that in 1997, 49 percent of the total tourism inquiries for specific information asked about wildlife viewing; in the first quarter of 2001, that rose to 64 percent.
Of those requesting wildlife-viewing information, 95 percent were asking about Kodiak bears.
Approximately 85 percent of the lodges with membership in KICVB advertise bear viewing as part of services they provide.
According to one study (Miller 1999), visitors' average willingness to pay for day trips involving wildlife-viewing opportunities varied from a low of $108 to see Dall sheep to a high of $355 to see grizzly bears.
Alaska's wildlife resources are the best the nation has to offer, and Kodiak bears are likely the most sought-after by wildlife viewers visiting the Kodiak archipelago.
There are, of course, a variety of types of wildlife viewers.
Some are looking to see a large number of animals or species in a brief period of time.
Others are interested in spending more time observing bears and their behavior and interaction with their natural habitat.
Still another type may wish to devote days or weeks to observing bears as far from structured viewing situations as possible.
Kodiak is in a position to provide opportunities that meet all these desires.

Depredation permits would be issued to an individual, to allow killing of a problem bear, in a specific incident and would only be available after careful consideration by ADF
Reporting and salvage requirements would be the same as under the DLP provisions.

6.6.1
Interface of Bear Viewing and Other Activities
Well-managed bear populations provide opportunities for diverse recreational activities throughout the Kodiak archipelago, including on the Kodiak National Wildlife Refuge (KNWR).
It is assumed that through existing and creative management practices, these activities are compatible and nonexclusive.
It is the CAC's strong belief that, in general, bear viewing is compatible with other recreational and commercial activities (e.g., sport fishing, hunting, guiding, hiking) that take place in areas that might be considered for development of formalized bear-viewing opportunities.
None of the recommendations made in this document are intended to displace these activities as long as the bears themselves and their habitat are not threatened in any way.
Numerous studies have been done to determine the compatibility of bear-viewing activities with other traditional uses of the same resource or area (e.g., commercial photography, bear hunting, sport and commercial fishing activities, camping and hiking).
Extensive work by KNWR staff investigated bear-human interactions on the O'Malley and Thumb river drainages from 1991 through 1999.
Results from one of those studies are summarized in a paper published in Ursus in 1998 (Wilker and Barnes 1998), an abstract of which can be found in Appendix V. Some of these studies looked at the interface from the human viewpoint: Â· Â· Â· Â· How far away do photographers have to remain from bear viewers? If a bear is habituated to human presence, is it "fair" to hunt it? Can anglers continue to fish in bear-viewing areas? Do weirs and other fisheries research tools have a negative effect on either bears or viewers?
Others considered the potential effects on bears: Â· Â· Â· Â· displacement disturbance human habituation competition for habitat resources (e.g., food, water, cover, space)
Generally speaking, when people establish patterns of use in particular areas, bears respect those patterns.
Bears accommodate a level of human presence that works for them; if humans learn to read bears' actions and follow guidelines based on considerable study by wildlife professionals, that level of presence can work for people as well.
Bears respond with neutral habituation (see section 6.1) to humans when people are present in a predictable, nonthreatening manner.
Of course, management needs to set limitations on the numbers of humans and their activities to ensure that these are not detrimental to bears' well-being or to their habitat.
Responsible commercial wildlife photographers subscribe to a code of field ethics that advocates against bear disturbance or displacement (see Appendix H).
Photographers do have equipment limitations regarding distances and locations, and thus their needs must be considered

when establishing guidelines for use of a bear-viewing site.
Their presence, however, need not interfere with the activities of bear viewers any more than they do with the activities of the bears.
It has been noted that the bears that frequent formal viewing sites are rarely the same bears being sought by trophy hunters.
Subadults, sows, and sows with cubs are usually the bears being observed by bear-viewers.
The adult males tend to avoid bear-viewing areas, preferring either to feed on another part of the river or to feed at night when no bear viewers are present.
Conflicts between anglers and bears usually are related
