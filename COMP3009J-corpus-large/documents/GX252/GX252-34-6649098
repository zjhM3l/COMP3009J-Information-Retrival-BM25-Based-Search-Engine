New Jersey Corn Acreage Down 10,000 Acres The New Jersey Agricultural Statistics Service in Trenton recently surveyed about 420 Garden State farmers as a part of a national survey to determine row crop and small grain acreage planted for harvest this year.
Row crop conditions on June 1, 2003, were mostly good across the state with top soil moisture supplies rated surplus to adequate in most areas.
Wet weather conditions limited field work to an average of two to three days per week for the time period from May 19, 2003, through June 20, 2003.
Total planted acreage devoted to corn was down 10,000 acres from last year.
If this acreage level holds, it will tie the state record low of 80,000 acres set in 2001.
Acreage seeded to barley and soybeans for the 2003 crop year was identical to the previous year.
Wheat acreage was down 7,000 from 2002.
Acreage cut for dry hay was also unchanged from the previous year.
Summer potato planted acreage was unchanged from 2002 while sweet potato acres planted fell 100 acres from the previous year.

June Agricultural Survey
New Jersey Crop Acreage (Continued) New Jersey Barley Acreage Unchanged at 4,000 Acres Barley planted acreage for 2003 at 4,000 was unchanged from 2002.
This is 1,000 acres less than the average planted acreage figure of 5,000 for the last 10 years.
Harvested acreage for the 2003 crop year is 3,000 acres, which is the same as last year.
The past 10 year average acres harvested is 3,900 acres.
The state record is 27,000 acres harvested in 1958.
The record low is 1,000 acres in 1936.
New Jersey Corn Acreage Down 10,000 Acres Corn planting activities were delayed across most of New Jersey this year by wet, cool weather conditions during May and June.
At 80,000 total acres, New Jersey acreage planted to corn equaled the record low set in 2001, and is 10,000 acres less than 2002's planted figure of 90,000 acres.
This year's planted acreage estimate is 80 percent of the ten year average of 96,000 acres.
Acreage to be harvested for grain in 2003 is projected at 67,000 acres, which is 3,000 acres less than last year, and 85 percent of the 10 year average of 78,000 acres.
In 1891 New Jersey's corn acreage was at an all-time high of 361,000 acres.
New Jersey Hay Acreage Unchanged from 2003 The wet, cool weather conditions during the months of May and June in 2003 delayed hay cutting in most fields.
Alfalfa hay harvested acres, at 25,000, were the same as 2002's board figure, and 89 percent of the 10 year average of 28,000 acres.
Acreage for other hay, at 90,000, was unchanged from last year.
The other hay estimate of 90,000 acres is 96 percent of the 10 year average of 94,000 harvested acres.
The combined all hay harvested acreage of 115,000 is 94 percent of New Jersey's 10 year average of 122,000 harvested acres.
Hay acreage was at its highest point in 1909, when 391,000 acres were cut.
A low of 107,000 acres were harvested in 1980.
Summer Potato Acreage Unchanged at 2,600 Acres New Jersey's summer potato acreage of 2,600, for both planted and harvested, was the same as 2002.
Summer potato acreage in the state has remained relatively constant over the last 10 years, with an average planted and harvested figure of 2,600 acres.
Potato acreage was its highest in 1917 at 94,000 acres, while 2001 saw potatoes at a record low of 2,500 acres.
Sweet Potato Acreage Down 1,000 Acres New Jersey sweet potato acreage has been set at 1,100 for both planted and harvested acres for the year 2003.
This is 100 acres less than the previous year's level of 1,200 acres each.
Over the past 10 years, sweet potato planted acreage in the state has ranged from a record low of 1,000 acres in 1999, to 1,500 acres for 1994 and 1995, with an average of 1,200 acres for the 10 year span.
Harvested acreage over the same time period was a maximum of 1,400 acres in 1994, and down to a record low of 1,000 acres in 1998 and 1999.
Sweet potato acreage was at its height in 1909 when 23,000 acres were harvested.
Projected Soybean Planted Acres Unchanged from 2002 Soybean planting was delayed this year due to the cool, wet conditions during May and June.
Based on the results of last month's survey, the 2003 soybean planted acreage figure was set at 100,000 acres, the same as last year.
This is 86 percent of the average soybean planted figure of 116,600 acres for the last 10 years.
In 1979 a record high of 205,000 acres were planted, with a low of 1,000 acres planted in 1927.
New Jersey Winter Wheat Acreage Down 7,000 acres Winter wheat seedings in 2002 were 31,000 acres, 7,000 acres less than the previous year, and 78 percent of the 10 year average of 39,700 acres.
Harvest for the 2003 crop year has been delayed by the wet, cool weather conditions during May and June.
The projected harvested figure for the 2003 crop year is 26,000 acres.
The 2003 harvested projection is 6,000 acres less than last year's harvested board figure of 32,000 acres, and 77 percent of the 10 year average of 33,700 acres.
A record high of 163,000 acres was harvested in 1878, while the lowest number of harvested acres, 25,000, was set 100 years later, in 1978.
New Jersey's Peach Crop Up Twenty Nine Percent The New Jersey Agricultural Statistics Service in Trenton recently surveyed New Jersey peach farmers as part of a national survey to determine the expected 2003 peach crop based on conditions as of July 1, 2003.
The 2003 Garden State peach crop is estimated at 80 million pounds, up 18 million from the previous year.
In New Jersey, bloom and fruit set were good to excellent.
Sufficient soil moisture and recent high temperatures benefitted fruit development.
The record high total production for the state was 137 million pounds set in 1960.
The July 2003 forecast of United States peach production is 2.62 billion pounds, up 2 percent from 2002, and 8 percent above 2001.
As shown in the table below, seven of the top ten peach producing states forecast an increase in production from last year.
California's production remained the same, and South Carolina and Washington both expect decreases in production.
These ten states account for over 94 percent of the United States peach forecast.

New Jersey Potato and Sweet Potato New Jersey potato growers were surveyed as a part of a national survey to determine the expected 2003 production based on conditions as of July 1, 2003.
Expected Garden State potato yields were estimated at 240 cwt, down 35 cwt from 2002.
New Jersey's record yield was set in 2001 at 285 cwt per harvested acre.
Production is set at 624 thousand cwt. Record potato production for New Jersey was set at 8.93 million cwt in 1922.
Recent high temperatures and humidity provided favorable conditions for vine and tuber development.
Recent dry conditions reduced the threat of plant diseases.
Prospects are good at the current time.

Prices Received by Farmers The preliminary All Farm Products Index of Prices Received by Farmers in June 2003 is 106, based on 1990-92=100, unchanged from the May Index.
Since last month, all commodity group indexes are unchanged or lower except for the fruits and nuts, meat animals, and poultry and eggs commodity groups.
Lower prices for cantaloupes, onions, peaches, and strawberries offset higher prices for tomatoes, broilers, hogs, and eggs.
The seasonal change in the mix of commodities farmers sell, based on the past 3-year average, also affects the overall index.
Increased average marketings of wheat, grapes, hay, and cantaloupes offset decreased marketings of oranges, tomatoes, strawberries, and sweet corn.
The preliminary All Farm Products Index is up 8 points (8.2 percent) from June 2002.
Higher prices for cattle, lettuce, hogs, and broilers more than offset lower prices for peaches, potatoes, sweet corn, and broccoli.
The Food Commodities Index, at 105, is unchanged from May but 9 points (9.4 percent) above June last year.
