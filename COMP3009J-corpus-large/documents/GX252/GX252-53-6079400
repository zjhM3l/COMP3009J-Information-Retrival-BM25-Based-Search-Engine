State of California, Military Department March 2002 State of California Military Department Flags Over California This booklet, "Flags Over California", has been designed to provide information on the California State (Bear) Flag, as well as to set forth the various rules and regulations regarding the proper display of and respect due both our National Flag and the Official Flag of the State of California.
Since the 1961 Regular (General) Session, legislation has been in effect which directs The Adjutant General to periodically compile the laws and regulations regarding the State Flag.
Section 439 was added to the Government Code to read: "439.
The Adjutant General shall by regulation, prescribe rules regarding the times, places, and manner in which the State Flag may be displayed.
He shall periodically compile the laws and regulations regarding the State Flag.Copies of the compilation shall be printed and made available to the public at cost by the Department of General Services."
Information contained in this booklet was obtained from the California Blue Books, Government Code, Military and Veterans Code, United States Code and various documents, books and web sites containing information on the Bear Flag.
The information contained in this booklet was prepared by members of the Directorate of Administration of the Military Department, State of California.

17 18 18 18 19 21 21 22 25 26 27 State of California Military Department Flags that have flown over California The principal predecessors of the California Bear Flag are shown on the following pages.
They represent periods of history and development in California.
To many people flags are an everyday object, but they generally know little or nothing of their history, symbolism, or usage.
Flags have been used for thousands of years by almost every society in which people live in urban conditions.
The vast majority of flags have had religious or military significance.
In the past few centuries flags have also been used for political parties, commercial enterprises and signaling purposes.
The use of state and national flags is a rather recent development.
The American Revolution of 1775-1783 and the French Revolution of 1789 influenced the modern sense of citizen participation in the formation of a nation.
That is when flags made a dramatic change from being exclusively the privilege of the ruling classes (kings, soldiers, priests) to becoming symbols of common women and men.
The story of the origin of the California Bear Flag parallels the story of the origin of our state.
Flags of explorers, Spanish and Mexican Empires, England, Russia, the United States and even a pirate have waved in the breezes over what is now known as California since the year 1542.
The Spanish Empire Flag This is the royal standard of Carlos V which appeared at the head of every band of Spanish explorers, as Spain had no national flag at the time.
The field is white and bears the arms of Castile and Leon, with the royal crown at the top of the shield and around it the collar of the Order of the Golden Fleece.
At a point near Mugu Lagoon, in Ventura County, on October 10,1542, Juan Rodriguez Cabrilo raised the flag of the Spanish Empire and took possession of California for Spain.
The Spanish National Ensign 1785-1822 Replacing two previous Spanish Empire Flags raised at San Diego by Gaspar de Portola and Father Junipero Serra, was the newly created Spanish National Flag.
This flag was raised over the Monterey Presidio in 1785 where it continued to fly until the end of Spanish rule in 1822.
The flag is predominantly yellow with bands of red across the top and bottom.
The center of the flag bears the arms of Castile and Leon enclosed by the Collar of the Order of the Golden Fleece, topped by the Crown of Spain.
The Flag of England 1579 Planted by Sir Francis Drake at Drake's Bay on June 17, 1579, it flew over California, which he called "New Albion", for only 37 days.
The flag is white with the red cross of St. George.
Russian-American Company 1812-1841 Tsar Paul granted a company charter to the Russian American Company that gave it a complete monopoly over all Russian enterprises in North America.
In 1806, the company was granted its own flag.
1 State of California During June of 1812, an expeditionary crew of 25 Russian Nationals and 80 Alaskans began construction of houses and a stockade on the site of the ancient Pomo Indian village of Mad-shui-miu.
The northern California coast outpost has since been renamed Fort Ross.
Coincidental with the Flag of Russia the banner that was hoisted above the new colony was the flag of the Russian American Company.
It consists of a broad white band filling the top half of the flag, with two equalwidth bars of blue and red respectively completing its basic makeup.
Centered in the top half was the traditional Russian double eagle.
With this flag flew the Czarist Russian Flag.
Military Department The Mexican Empire flag was raised at the Presidio of Monterey, California, on April 11, 1822 and for several years the Northern California community of Monterey, under the flag of the Mexican Empire, was the seat of a provisional government, independent from any ruling sovereign.
The Mexican Republic Flag 1824 -1836 
This flag has three vertical bars of green, white and red.
An eagle perched on a cactus over a laurel wreath appears in the center bar.
Except for a few brief months in late 1836 and early 1837, when a lone red star flag on a white background was raised in recognition of the efforts of Juan Bautista Alvarado and Isaac Graham's capture of Monterey from the Mexican government thereby establishing California as "a free and sovereign state the Mexican Flag continued to fly as California's official flag until the American conquest.
The Flag of Russia 1812-1841 On September 10,1812, Ivan A. Kuskov, established Fort Ross and claimed the Northern California coast for the Czar.
He unfurled the flag of Russia, the light blue Cross of St. Andrew on a field of white.
The Flag of Argentina (Bouchard's Flag) 1818 The revolutionary colonist Hippolyte de Bouchard, called by some a pirate, sailed into Monterey Bay in November, 1818.
Flying the revolutionary flag of Buenos Aries, which was similar to that of the present Argentine national ensign, from his flagship's masthead, Bouchard demanded the complete surrender of the Spanish city.
Finding immediate resistance, the pirates sacked, looted and burned the small city "in the name of liberty".
The Argentine flag was flown for sixteen days.
It consists of three bars of equal width, the outer two of blue, and the center one of white.
A stylized golden sun appears on the white band, to the left of the flag's center.
The Fremont Flag 1845-1846 In the year 1845, Captain John Fremont, United States Topographical Engineers, headed what was termed a "scientific" expedition into California.
The ruling Mexican authorities permitted the Fremont party to winter in California, providing that they avoided the coastal settlements.
Because Fremont was on a topographical expedition into areas claimed by Mexico, he chose not to carry a regular U.S. flag.
Instead, his wife, Jessie, drew and made this flag using elements of design taken from the Stars and Stripes and Army regimental flags The white canton featured twenty-six stars, outlined in blue, in two undulating waves above and below a blue eagle clutching in its talons nine blue arrows and a red and white peace pipe as a sign of peace to the local Indians.
Upon learning that Fremont and his 60 armed men were marching towards Salinas, the Mexican officials ordered the "scientific" party out of California.
Fremont's group withdrew to Gavilan Peak, where they erected a log fortress.
From the newly built fort he flew the Fremont flag (the only flag in his possession).
This flag is displayed in the library of the Southwest museum in Los Angeles, California.
The Mexican Empire Flag 1822-1824 Upon Mexico's gaining of independence from Spain in April of 1822, a meeting of the leading governing officials resulted in the declaration of California's allegiance to the new nation.
2 State of California Military Department U.S. Naval Forces, at Monterey on July 9, 1846.
That banner boasted 28 stars, arranged in four rows of seven stars each, and was subsequently modified as new states entered the Union.
The 31st star, in recognition of California's entry into the Union on September 9, 1850, was physically added on July 4, 1851.
The flag of the United S tates grew to 48 stars in 1912.
It remained unchanged for 47 years.
The territory of Alaska was admitted as the 49th state on January 3, 1959, and the 49th star was added July 4, 1959.
Hawaii became the 50th state on August 21, 1959, although the 50th star did not appear on the American flag until July 4, 1960.
The Flag of the United States 1846 The first "S tars and S tripes" were raised over California by Commodore John C. Sloat, commander of Flags of the Bear Flag Revolt The Yankees in California did not revolt under the same flag.
The historic bear flag and other flags in use by various groups of the Bear Flag Revolt are shown on the following pages.
The first Yankees in California did not initially intend to overthrow the Mexican authority, but in 1846 the defense of California was completely neglected by Mexico and it was extremely weak militarily.
Mexico lacked the support of their Californio administrators who were in California and anticipated statehood.
Any military power could have easily captured California.
A small uprising of settlers in the north resulted in the Bear Flag Republic which existed from June 14 to July 11, 1847.
American forces arrived by sea and gained control of the entire region without firing a shot.
A small revolt at Los Angeles led to a pocket of Californio resistance lasting from September 1846 to January 1847.
Today's California State Flag has evolved from the historic Bear Flag (Todd Flag) which was first raised at the town of Sonoma on June 14, 1846 by Americans who proclaimed California independent of Mexico in what became known as the Bear Flag Revolt.
3 State of California Military Department The McChristian Flag This flag is the only surviving flag known to have belonged to a "Bear Flagger."
The design combines elements of both the Bear Flag and the Stars and Stripes.
The flag was probably made after 1850 because the bear is remarkably similar to a famous painting of a California grizzly done by Charles Nahl in 1850.
The Ide Flag Was designed by H.L. Ford for William Brown Ide who was the first and only "President" of the California Republic.
A rumor spread that the Mexican government planned to evict all illegal American settlers.
In June, 1846, Ide joined a band of Americans who advanced on the pueblo of Sonoma and captured Mariano Vallejo, the Mexican Comandante of Northern California.
Sonoma was taken without a shot, and on June 14, 1846, the Bear Flag was raised and Ide was chosen to lead the new California Republic.
The Revere Guidon A guidon is a small flag used to guide and rally troops.
The Revere Guidon is believed to be one of the guidons of the California Battalion.
This flag was removed by U.S. Navy Lieutenant Joseph Warren Revere, Paul Revere's grandson, from the barracks at Sonoma as a souvenir.
It was returned to California at the suggestion of General William T. Sherman, only to be destroyed with the Todd Flag in the San Francisco Earthquake and Fire of 1906.
The Dr. Semple Flag The image of this flag is based upon a description, since the original flag has not survived.
Dr. Robert Semple was one of the men that arrested General Vallejo and was the editor of California's first newspaper, The Californian.
On December 22, 1846, Mariano Guadalupe Vallejo deeded an undivided half of a tract of five square miles of the Soscol Rancho to Robert Semple.
Vallejo wanted the town to be named Francisca, in honor of his wife, Dona Francisca Benicia Carrillo.
The attempt to appropriate the name as well as the commercial supremacy of San Francisco was made difficult by an order requiring the name San Francisco substituted for Yerba Buena on all public documents.
Doctor Semple was very displeased at this action and spluttered over it in The Californian.
To prevent confusion and trouble the name Francisca was changed to Benicia, the second name of Senora Vallejo.
There was an attempt to have Benicia named the capital of California.
General Vallejo did his best making most generous offers to the legislature of land and money if they would move the capital there.
The Pico Flag This design, which appears as an illustration at the bottom of the Spanish version of California's Proclamation of Independence made for Pio Pico, probably never was made into a flag.
This is the only version of the Bear Flag depicted with a vertical strip.
The Storm Flag The Swasey Flag This reconstruction is based on a description in Bancrofts History of California.
The red , white, and blue stripes were probably inspired by the American Flag.
This flag, depicting the bear standing, was sewn by Peter Storm for use by the Bear Flag Party, and may have preceded the Todd Flag.
It was buried with Storm in Calistoga, California.
4 State of California Military Department The First California Bear Flag Photograph of the Original Todd Flag The original Bear Flag was preserved and displayed for many years in the San Francisco offices of the Society of California Pioneers, however it was destroyed during the earthquake and fire of 1906.
The First Bear Flag 1846 The banner was hoisted up a hastily constructed wooden flagpole by a group of American settlers in revolt against the Mexican authorities.
William L. Todd, a nephew of Mary Todd (Mrs. Abraham Lincoln), who is most generally credited with the actual making of the original Bear Flag, stated in a letter to the Los Angeles Express in 1878, that a piece of new unbleached domestic cotton with a stripe of four-inch red flannel attached to its lower side, was used.
A "Lone Star" was drawn in the upper left-hand corner of the flag with blackberry juice in recognition of California's Lone Star flag of 1836, and that a grizzly bear as a symbol of "strength and unyielding resistance filled the flag's center area.
Appearing beneath the bear in were the words "California Republic".
The whole flag was about three by five feet.
The flag flew over Sonoma until it was replaced on July 9, 1846 by the Stars and Stripes.
The design served as the model for the current state flag.
5 State of California Military Department The Current California Bear Flag The State Flag of California In 1911, the Legislature adopted the Bear Flag as the State Flag of California.
The law was incorporated in the government Doce in 1943 as Section 420.
In 1953, Senate Bill No. 1014 (Chapter 1140, Statutes of 1953), amended the section to read as follows: "420.
The Bear Flag is the State Flag of California.
As viewed with the hoist end of the flag to the left of the observer there appears in the upper left-hand corner of a white field a five-pointed red star with one point vertically upward and in the middle of the white field a brown grizzly bear walking toward the left with all four paws on the green grass plot, with head and eye turned slightly toward the observer, a red stripe forms the length of the flag at the bottom and between the grass plot and red stripe appear the words CALIFORNIA REPUBLIC.

Various bear images appeared on the flag until the design was standardized in 1953 modeled after the 1855 watercolor by Charles Nahl, shown here.
This image was also used as a model for the sculpture.

12 State of California Military Department United States Code Previous to Flag Day, June 14, 1923 there were no federal or state regulations governing display of the United States Flag.
It was on this date that the National Flag Code was adopted by the National Flag Conference which was attended by representatives of the Army and Navy which had evolved their own procedures, and some 66 other national groups.
This purpose of providing guidance based on the Army and Navy procedures relating to display and associated questions about the U. S. Flag was adopted by all organizations in attendance.
A few minor changes were made a year later during the Flag Day 1924 Conference, It was not until June 22, 1942 that Congress passed a joint resolution which was amended on December 22, 1942 to become Public Law 829; Chapter 806, 77th Congress, 2nd session.
Exact rules for use and display of the flag (36 U.S.C. 173-178) as well as associated sections (36 U.S.C. 171) Conduct during Playing of the National Anthem, (36 U.S.C. 172) the Pledge of Allegiance to the Flag, and Manner of Delivery were included.
This code is the guide for all handling and display of the Stars and Stripes.
It does not impose penalties for misuse of the United States Flag.
That is left to the states and to the federal government for the District of Columbia.
Each state has its own flag law.
Criminal penalties for certain acts of desecration to the flag were contained in Title 18 of the United States Code prior to 1989.
The Supreme Court decision in Texas v. Johnson; June 21, 1989, held the statute unconstitutional.
This statute was amended when the Flag Protection Act of 1989 (Oct. 28, 1989) imposed a fine and/or up to 1 year in prison for knowingly mutilating, defacing, physically defiling, maintaining on the floor or trampling upon any flag of the United States.
The Flag Protection Act of 1989 was struck down by the Supreme Court decision, United States vs. Eichman, decided on June 11, 1990.
While the Code empowers the President of the United States to alter, modify, repeal or prescribe additional rules regarding the Flag, no federal agency has the authority to issue `official' rulings legally binding on civilians or civilian groups.
Consequently, different interpretations of various provisions of the Code may continue to be made.
The Flag Code may be fairly tested: `No disrespect should be shown to the Flag of the United States of America.'
Therefore, actions not specifically included in the Code may be deemed acceptable as long as proper respect is shown.

There are no Flag Code provisions which require any method, however, the following is traditional: OPEN EDGE The portion of the flag denoting honor is the canton of blue containing the stars representing states our veterans served in uniform.
The canton field of blue dresses from left to right and is inverted only when draped as a pall on the casket of a veteran who has served our country honorably in uniform.
In the Armed Forces of the United States, at the ceremony of retreat, the flag is lowered, folded in a triangle fold and kept under watch throughout the night as a tribute to our nation's honored dead.
The next morning it is brought out and, at the ceremony of reveille, run aloft as a symbol of our belief in the resurrection of the body.
FOLDED EDGE (a) Straighten out the flag to full length and fold lengthwise once.
OPEN EDGE Ã¯Â¿Â½ FOLDED EDGE The first fold of our flag is a symbol of life.
The second fold is a symbol of our belief in the eternal life.
(b) Fold it lengthwise a second time to meet the open edge, making sure that the union of stars on the blue field remains outward in full view.
(A large flag may have to be folded lengthwise a third time.)
OPEN EDGE Ã¯Â¿Â½ Ã¯Â¿Â½ The third fold is made in honor and remembrance of the veteran departing our ranks and who gave a portion of life for the defense of our country to attain peace throughout the world.
Ã¯Â¿Â½ The fourth fold represents our weaker nature; for as American citizens trusting in God, it is to Him we turn in times of peace as well as in times of war for His divine guidance.
Ã¯Â¿Â½ The fifth fold is a tribute to our country, for in the words of Stephen Decatur, "Our country, in dealing with other countries, may she always be right, but it is still our country, right or wrong."
Ã¯Â¿Â½ The sixth fold is for where our hearts lie.
It is with our heart that we pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States of America, and to the republic for which it stands, one nation under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all.
Ã¯Â¿Â½ The through our flag without seventh fold is a tribute to our Armed Forces, for it is the Armed Forces that we protect our country and against all enemies, whether they be found within or the boundaries of our republic.
FOLDED EDGE (c) A triangular fold is then started by bringing the striped corner of the folded edge to the open edge.
OPEN EDGE FOLDED EDGE (d) The outer point is then turned inward parallel with the open edge to form a second triangle.
OPEN EDGE FOLDED EDGE (e) The diagonal or triangular folding is continued toward the blue union until the end is reached, with only the blue showing and the form being that of a cocked (three corner) hat.
Ã¯Â¿Â½ The eighth fold is a tribute to the one who entered into the valley of the shadow of death, that we might see the light of day, and to honor our mother, for whom it flies on Mother 's Day.
26 State of California Military Department Ã¯Â¿Â½ The ninth fold is a tribute to womanhood, for it has been through their faith, love, loyalty and devotion that the character of the men and women who have made this country great have been molded.
The tenth fold is a tribute to father, for he, too, has given his sons and daughters for the defense of our country since he or she was first born.
Ã¯Â¿Â½ The twelfth fold, in the eyes of a Christian citizen, represents an emblem of eternity and glorifies, in their eyes, God the Father, the Son and Holy Ghost.
When the flag is completely folded, the stars are uppermost, reminding us of our national motto, "In God We Trust."
After the flag is completely folded and tucked in, it takes on the appearance of a cocked hat, ever reminding us of the soldiers who served under General George Washington and the sailors and marines who served under Captain John Paul Jones who were followed by their comrades and shipmates in the Armed Forces of the United States, preserving for us the rights, privileges, and freedoms we enjoy today.
Ã¯Â¿Â½ Ã¯Â¿Â½ The eleventh fold, in the eyes of Hebrew citizens, represents the lower portion of the seal of King David and King Solomon and glorifies, in their eyes, the God of Abraham, Isaac and Jacob.

This wording of the pledge varies slightly from the original, which was drawn up in 1892 in the office of The Youth's Companion magazine in Boston.
It was first used in the public schools in celebration of Columbus Day, 12 October 1892.
The pledge received official recognition by Congress in an Act approved 22 June 1942.
The phrase "under God" was added to the pledge by a Congressional Act of 14 June 1954.
At that time, President Eisenhower said that "in this way we are reaffirming the transcendence of religious faith in America's heritage and future; in this way we shall constantly strengthen those spiritual weapons which forever will be our country's most powerful resource in peace and war."
