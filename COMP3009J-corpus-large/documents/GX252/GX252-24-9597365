Summary of Evidence
Note: Separate PDQ summaries on Prevention of Prostate Cancer and Prostate Cancer Treatment are also available.
Digital Rectal Examination and Prostate-Specific Antigen
There is insufficient evidence to establish whether a decrease in mortality from prostate cancer occurs with screening by digital rectal examination or serum prostate-specific antigen.
While some observational studies of cohorts of men among whom prostate cancer screening was performed have witnessed a fall in prostate cancer mortality, these observations have not been consistent in all populations or within a given population.
Level of Evidence
3: Evidence obtained from well-designed and conducted cohort or case control analytic studies.
Screening may be accompanied by deterioration in elements of health-related quality of life, primarily due to the complications of therapeutic intervention, e.g., incontinence (both fecal and urinary), urethral stricture, sexual dysfunction, and the morbidity associated with general anesthesia and/or a major surgical procedure.[1,2]
Although potential harms of screening for prostate cancer can be established, the presence or magnitude of potential benefits cannot.
Therefore, the net benefit of screening cannot be determined.[3]

Significance
Incidence and Mortality
Prostate cancer is the most common malignant cancer in North American men (excluding skin cancers).
It is estimated that in 2003, approximately 220,900 new cases and 28,900 prostate cancer-related deaths will occur in the United States.[1] Prostate cancer is now the second leading cause of cancer death in men, exceeded only by lung cancer.
It accounts for 29% of all male cancers and 11% of male cancer-related deaths.
Age-adjusted incidence rates increased steadily over the past several decades, with dramatic increases associated with the widespread use of prostate-specific antigen (PSA) screening in the late 1980s and early 1990s, followed by a more recent fall in incidence.
Age-adjusted mortality rates have recently paralleled incidence rates with an increase followed by a decrease in the early 1990s.[2,3] It has been suggested by some that declines in mortality rates in certain jurisdictions reflect the benefit of PSA screening,[4]
Regional differences have been observed in incidence and mortality rates of prostate cancer as well as rates of radical prostatectomy.
The increased incidence until 1989 was most likely the result of increased tumor detection as a result of increasing rates of transurethral prostatectomy.[5,6] Subsequent increases were most likely due to widespread use of PSA for early detection and screening.[7,8]
While differences in aggregate mortality by regions of the United States have not been observed, considerable variation in mortality rates between African American and white men are seen.[9,10]
Risk Factors
Prostate cancer is rarely seen in men younger than 50 years; the incidence rises rapidly with each decade thereafter.
The age-adjusted incidence is higher in African American males (275.3 per 100,000) compared with white males (172.9 per 100,000).[1] African American males have a higher mortality from prostate cancer, even after attempts to adjust for access-to-care factors.[11]
Evidence from a case-control study within the PhysiciansÃ¯Â¿Â½ Health Study suggests that higher plasma insulin-like growth factor-I levels may be associated with a higher prostate cancer risk.[17]
Although the prevalence of prostate cancer and preneoplastic lesions found at autopsy steadily increases for each decade of age, most of these lesions remain clinically undetected.[18] The estimated lifetime risk of the diagnosis of prostate cancer is about 16% and 3% to 4% die of this disease.[19]
The biology and natural history of prostate cancer is not completely understood.
However, there is an association between primary tumor volume and local extent of disease, progression, and survival.[20] A review of a large number of prostate cancers in radical prostatectomy, cystectomy, and autopsy specimens showed that capsular penetration, seminal vesicle invasion, and lymph node metastases were usually found only with tumors larger than 1.4 cc.[21]
Cancer statistics from the American Cancer Society and the National Cancer Institute indicated in 2002 that the proportion of disease diagnosed at a locoregional stage or distant stage is 83% and 6% for whites compared with 78% and 9% for African Americans, respectively.[23] Stage distribution is affected substantially by early detection programs for prostate cancer.
Pathologic stage does not always reflect clinical stage and upstaging (due to either extracapsular extension, positive margins, seminal vesicle invasion, or lymph node involvement) occurs frequently.
Of the prostate cancers detected by digital rectal exam in the pre-PSA era, 67% to 88% were at a clinically-localized stage (T1-2 Nx M0).[24,25] In 1 of those series, however, of 2,002 patients undergoing annual screening digital rectal exam (DRE), only one third of men proved to have pathologically organ-confined disease.[25]
With the proliferation of PSA for early detection, reviews of large numbers of asymptomatic men found that the majority are organ-confined.
One study found that 63% of cancers detected in men undergoing their first screening PSA were pathologically organ-confined cancers; the percentage increased to 71% if cancer was detected on a subsequent examination.[26] In a series of 2,999 men undergoing screening with PSA, DRE, and transrectal ultrasound, 62% of the tumors detected were reported to be pathologically organ-confined.[27]
Survival rates for prostate cancer have improved from 1974 to the present.
Lead-time and length-bias effects of early detection and the possible influence of stage migration must also be considered when interpreting trends in survival data.[30] Reported survival rates may also vary, depending upon whether or not the analytical methods used reflect crude disease-specific rates (absolute disease-specific survival) or take into account competing risks for the given age group (relative disease-specific survival).
Five-year survival rates remain lower for all stages combined for African American patients than for white patients (92% versus 97% overall).
Survival rates for all races are 100% at 5 years for men with locoregional disease, but African American men with metastatic disease have a somewhat lower 5-year survival rate than white men with metastatic disease (30.5% versus 33.4%).[23] The reasons for these differences are unclear and studies in populations with equal access to medical care systems, such as the U.S. military medical system, have shown an absence of differences in stage-specific survival between African Americans and whites.[31,32]

Evidence of Benefit
Prior to the 1990s, the digital rectal examination (DRE) was the test traditionally mentioned for prostate cancer screening.
Two other test procedures are also available: transrectal ultrasound (TRUS) and prostate-specific antigen (PSA).[1] Prostate cancer screening is controversial due to the lack of definitive evidence of benefit.
Adding to the controversy is the lack of consensus regarding optimal treatment of localized disease and the clear evidence that active treatment options are associated with significant morbidity.
Treatment options for early stage disease include radical prostatectomy, definitive radiation therapy, and Ã¯Â¿Â½watchful waitingÃ¯Â¿Â½ (no active treatment unless indications of progression are present on active surveillance).
Multiple series from various years and institutions have been reported on the outcomes of patients with localized prostate cancer who received no treatment but were followed with surveillance alone.
Outcomes have also been reported for active treatments, but valid comparisons of efficacy between surgery, radiation, and watchful waiting are, unfortunately, seldom possible because of differences in reporting and selection factors in the various reported series.
A randomized trial in Scandinavian men, published in 2002, explored the benefit of radical prostatectomy over Ã¯Â¿Â½watchful waitingÃ¯Â¿Â½ in men with newly diagnosed, well-differentiated or moderately well-differentiated prostate cancers of clinical stages T1b, T1c, or T2.[2] Six hundred ninety-eight men under 75 years of age, the vast majority with clinically-detected rather than screen-detected cancers (unlike most newly diagnosed patients in North America) were randomized to the 2-arm trial.
After a median follow-up of 6.2 years there was no difference in all-cause mortality.
A lower cause-specific mortality rate was observed in men randomized to the prostatectomy arm than in those randomized to the watchful waiting arm (relative hazard 0.5, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.27-0.91 at 8 years of follow-up), after approximately 5 years.
Complications of radical prostatectomy can include urinary incontinence, urethral stricture, erectile dysfunction, and the morbidity associated with general anesthesia and a major surgical procedure.
Fecal incontinence can also occur.
Definitive external-beam radiation therapy can result in acute cystitis, proctitis, and sometimes enteritis.
These are generally reversible but may be chronic.
Potency, in the short term, is preserved with irradiation in the majority of cases, but may diminish over time.
(Refer to the PDQ summary on Prostate Cancer Treatment for more information.)
Digital Rectal Exam
Although DRE has been used for many years, careful evaluation of this modality has yet to take place.
Several observational studies have been reported that examined process measures such as sensitivity as well as case-survival data, but without appropriate controls and with no adjustment for lead-time and length biases.[3,4]
In 1984, 1 study reported on 811 unselected patients from 50 to 80 years of age who underwent rectal examination and follow-up.[5] Thirty-eight of 43 patients with a palpable abnormality in the prostate agreed to undergo biopsy.
The positive-predictive value of a palpable nodule, i.e., prostate cancer on biopsy, was 29% (11 of 38).
Further evaluation revealed that 45% of the cases were stage B, 36% were stage C, and 18% were stage D. More results from the same investigators revealed a 25% positive predictive value, with 68% of the detected tumors clinically localized but only approximately 30% pathologically localized after radical prostatectomy.[6] Some additional investigators also reported a high proportion of clinically localized disease when prostate cancer is detected by routine rectal examination,[7]
A number of studies have found that DRE has a poor predictive value for prostate cancer if PSA is at very low levels.
In the European Study on Screening for Prostate Cancer, 1 report found that if DRE is only used for a PSA 
By applying DRE only for patients with a PSA 
Among 10,523 men randomly assigned to screening, it was reported that the overall prostate cancer detection rate, using PSA, DRE, and TRUS, was 4.5% compared to only 2.5% if DRE alone had been used.
Among men with a PSA less than 3.0 ng/ml, the positive predictive value of DRE was only 4% to 11%.[11] Despite the poor performance of DRE, a retrospective case-control study of men in Olmsted County, Minnesota who died of prostate cancer found that case subjects were less likely to have undergone DRE during the 10 years before diagnosis of prostate cancer (odds ratio (OR) = 0.51, 95% CI of 0.31-0.84).
These data suggested that screening DREs may prevent from 50% to 70% of deaths from prostate cancer.[12] Contrary to these findings, results from a case-control study of 150 men who ultimately died of prostate cancer were compared to 299 controls without disease.
In this different population, a similar number of cases and controls had undergone DRE during the 10-year interval prior to prostate cancer diagnosis.[13] One case-control study reported no statistically significant association between routine screening with digital rectal examination and occurrence of metastatic prostate cancer.[14]
Rectal examination is inexpensive, relatively noninvasive, nonmorbid and can be taught to nonprofessional health workers; however, its effectiveness depends on the skill and experience of the examiner.
Whether routine annual screening by rectal examination reduces prostate cancer mortality remains to be determined.
Transrectal Ultrasound and Other Imaging Tests
Imaging procedures have been suggested as possible screening modalities for prostate cancer.
Prostatic imaging is possible by ultrasound, computed tomography, and magnetic resonance imaging.
Each modality has relative merits and disadvantages for distinguishing different features of prostate cancer.
Ultrasound has received the most attention, having been examined by several investigators in observational settings.
One report found that ultrasound has a low sensitivity and specificity with regard to the values necessary for screening.[15] Sensitivity ranged from 71% to 92% for prostatic carcinoma and 60% to 85% for subclinical disease.
Specificity values ranged from 49% to 79%, and positive predictive values in the 30% range have been reported.
The sensitivity and positive predictive value for ultrasound as a single test may be better than for rectal examination.
The rate of cancer among ultrasound-positive subjects in whom rectal and PSA examinations are normal is extremely low.[16] Because of low specificity and sensitivity, transrectal ultrasound (TRUS) is relegated to a role in the diagnostic work-up of an abnormal screening test.
The cost and poor performance characteristics of other imaging modalities have led to their elimination from all early detection algorithms.
Contemporary prostate biopsy relies on spring-loaded biopsy devices that are either digitally guided or guided via ultrasound.
Transrectal ultrasound guidance is the most frequent method of directing prostate needle biopsy as there is some suggestion that the yield of biopsy is improved with such guidance.[17] With the virtually simultaneous clinical acceptance of tr
Prostate-Specific Antigen
A more promising screening test is measurement of serum prostate-specific antigen (PSA).
This test has been examined in several observational settings, both for initial diagnosis of disease and as a tool to monitor for recurrence after initial therapy, and for prognosis of outcomes after therapy.[21] Parameter estimates for this test include sensitivity in the range of 70%.[21]
PSA has increased the detection rate of early-stage cancers, many of which may be curable by local-modality therapies.[22-25] Circumstantial evidence favoring screening for prostate cancer is analogous to that for lung cancer screening in the 1950s and 1960s; screening results in a shift to a higher proportion of cases with earlier-stage cancers at diagnosis which may or may not result in mortality reduction.
For lung cancer, no mortality benefit resulted.[26] The possibility of identifying an excessive number of false positives in the form of benign prostatic lesions requires, however, that the test be evaluated carefully.
A nested case-control prospective study with 10 years of follow-up reported that a single elevated PSA greater than 4.0 ng/ml predicted subsequent cancer with a sensitivity of 71% for the first 5 years and a specificity of 91% for the first 10 years of follow-up.
The cancers diagnosed were characterized by stage and grade to be clinically significant.
Forty-two percent were extracapsular at diagnosis.[27] Experience with repeat PSA screening suggests that tumors detected on follow-up examinations are of lower clinical stage and grade.[28]
Probably the largest PSA/DRE early diagnosis experience comes from the Prostate Cancer Awareness Week program, conducted at numerous sites around the United States.
A report from that program indicates that of 116,073 participating men, if a 4.0 ng/ml PSA cutoff value was used, 22,014 men had an abnormal PSA, DRE, or both.
Various methods to improve the performance of PSA screening in early cancer detection have been developed (see below).
However, the proportion of men who have Ã¯Â¿Â½abnormalÃ¯Â¿Â½ PSA tests that revert to Ã¯Â¿Â½normalÃ¯Â¿Â½ after one year is high (65%-83%, depending on the method).[32] This is likely because of a substantial biological variability in PSA levels in individual men.
Therefore, an elevated PSA should be confirmed on repeat-testing before more invasive diagnostic tests are performed.
Methods to Improve the Performance of the Early Detection of Prostate Cancer:
Complexed PSA and Percent Free PSA
Serum PSA exists in both free form and complexed to a number of protease inhibitors, especially alpha-1 antichymotrypsin.
Assays for total PSA measure both free and complexed forms.
Assays for free PSA are available.
Complexed PSA can be found by subtracting free from total.
Several studies have addressed whether complexed PSA or percent free PSA (ratio of free to total) are more sensitive and specific than total PSA.
One retrospective study evaluated total PSA, free/total, and complexed PSA in a group of 300 men, 75 of whom had prostate cancer.
Large values of total, small values of free/total, and large values of complexed PSA were associated with the presence of cancer.
The authors chose the cutoff of each measure to yield 95% sensitivity and found estimated specificities of 21.8%, 15.6%, and 26.7%, respectively.[33] However, the preponderance of evidence concerning the utility of complexed and percent free PSA is not clear and total PSA remains the standard.
A number of authors have considered whether complexed PSA or percent free PSA in conjunction with total PSA can improve the latterÃ¯Â¿Â½s sensitivity.
Of special interest is the Ã¯Â¿Â½gray zoneÃ¯Â¿Â½ of total PSA, the range from 2.5 to 10 ng/ml.
A meta-analysis of 18 studies addressed the added diagnostic benefit of percent free PSA.
There was no uniformity of cutoff among these studies.
For cutoffs ranging from 8% to 25% (free/total), sensitivity/specificity ranged from about 45%/95% to 95%/15%.[34]
Percent free PSA may be related to biologic activity of the tumor.
One study compared the percent free PSA with the pathologic features of prostate cancer among 108 men with clinically localized disease who ultimately underwent radical prostatectomy.
Lower percent free PSA values were associated with higher risk of extracapsular disease and greater capsular volume.[35] Similar findings were reported in another large series.[36]
PSA Density
As larger prostates, caused by increased amounts of transition-zone hyperplasia, are known to be associated with higher serum PSA levels, reports have suggested indexing PSA to gland volume, using a measure known as PSA density.
PSA density is defined as serum PSA divided by gland volume.
Generally, ultrasound is used to measure gland volume.
While early studies suggested that this measure may discriminate between patients with cancer and those with benign disease,[37] subsequent evaluations have failed to confirm any clinically useful association.[38,39]
PSA Density of the Transition Zone
Some studies have demonstrated that PSA is best adjusted either to total gland volume or to the volume of the transition zone, noting that in general, PSA production by benign epithelium is related to the volume of such epithelium.
The adjustments of PSA density (serum PSA divided by gland volume) or PSA density of the transition zone (serum PSA divided by the volume of the transition zone) have been suggested to adjust for these benign sources of PSA.
One study prospectively evaluated 559 men with PSA levels between 4.0 and 10.0 ng/ml.
A total of 217 of these men were ultimately found to have prostate cancer and of all PSA variants analyzed, percent free PSA and PSA density of the transition zone were found to have the best predictive value (area under the receiver operator curve values of 0.78 and 0.83, respectively).[40] Another study also found that PSA density of the transition zone had superio
In this study of 308 volunteers undergoing first-time screening, it was reported that the combination of percent free PSA (
Age-adjusted PSA
Many series have noted that PSA levels increase with age, such that men without prostate cancer will have higher PSA values as they grow older.
One study examined the impact of the use of age-adjusted PSA values during screening and estimated that it would reduce the false-positive screenings by 27% and overdiagnosis by greater than 33% while retaining 95% of any survival advantage gained by early diagnosis.[42] While age adjustment tends to improve sensitivity for younger men and specificity for older men, the trade-off in terms of more biopsies in younger men and potentially missing cancers in older men has prevented uniform acceptance of this approach.
PSA Velocity
A study using frozen serum from 18 patients concluded that an annual rise of PSA level of 0.8% ng/ml warranted a prostate biopsy.[43] In a follow-up study that used serum collected serially from men without known prostate cancer (2 groups with benign prostatic hyperplasia, 1 diagnosed by histology and the other clinically, both with PSA levels Ã¯Â¿Â½10 ng/ml, and a third group with no more than 1 PSA exceeding 10 ng/ml), it was reported that averaging 3 PSA changes measured at 2-year intervals could be useful for cancer discrimination, while changes measured at 3-month or 6-month intervals were volatile and nonspecific, perhaps because of a biologic fluctuation of PSA which may be as high as 30%.[44,45]
Alteration of PSA Cutoff Level
A number of authors have begun to explore the possibility of using PSA levels lower than 4.0 ng/ml as the upper limit of normal for screening examinations.
One study screened 14,209 white and 1,004 African American men for prostate cancer using an upper limit of normal of 2.5 ng/ml for PSA.
A major confounding factor of this study was that only 40% of those men in whom a prostate biopsy was recommended actually underwent biopsy.
Nevertheless, 27% of all men undergoing biopsy were found to have prostate cancer.[29] Several collaborating European jurisdictions are conducting prostate cancer screening trials.
Both Rotterdam (the Netherlands) and Finland are among them.
In Rotterdam data for 7,943 screened men between the ages of 55 and 74 have been reported.
Of the 534 men who had PSA levels between 3.0 and 3.9 ng/ml, 446 (83.5%) had biopsies and 96 (18%) of these had prostate cancer.
In all, 4.7% of the screened population had prostate cancer.[47] In Finland, 15,685 men were screened and 14% of screened men had PSA levels of 3.0 ng/ml or greater.
All men with PSA above 4.0 ng/ml were recommended to diagnostic follow-up by digital rectal examination, ultrasound and biopsy; 92% complied and 2.6% of the 15,685 men screened were diagnosed with prostate cancer.
Of the 801 men with screening PSA between 3.0 and 3.9 ng/ml (all biopsied), 22 (3%) had cancer.
Of the 1,116 men with screening PSA between 4.0 and 9.9, 247 (22%) had cancer, and of the 226 men with screening PSA of 10 or greater, 139 (62%) had cancer.[48] Several factors could have contributed to these differences, including background prostate cancer prevalence, background screening levels, and details regarding diagnostic follow-up practices; the necessary comparative data are not available.
Another study adopted a change in the PSA cutoff to a level of 3.0 ng/ml to study the impact of this change in 243 men with a PSA level between 3.0 and 4.0 ng/ml.
Thirty-two of the men (13.2%) were ultimately found to have prostate cancer.
An analysis of radical prostatectomy specimens from this series found a mean tumor volume of 1.8 cc (range 0.6-4.4).
The extent of disease was significant in a number of cases with positive margins in 5, and pathologic pT3 disease in 6 cases.[30]
Several variables can affect PSA levels in men.
Besides normal biological fluctuations, which appear to occur,[32,44] certain pharmaceuticals, such as finasteride (which reduces PSA by approximately 50%), and over-the-counter agents, such as PC-SPES (an herbal agent that appears to have estrogenic effects), can affect PSA levels.[49,50]
Frequency of Screening
The optimal frequency and age range for PSA (and DRE) testing are unknown.[42,52,53]
Types of Tumors Detected by Prostate Cancer Screening
Of serious concern with regard to prostate cancer screening is the high background histologic prevalence of the disease.
It has been demonstrated that a considerable fraction (approximately one third) of men in their fourth and fifth decades have histologically-evident prostate cancer.[54] Most of these tumors are well-differentiated and microscopic in size.
Conversely, evidence suggests that tumors of potential clinical significance are larger and higher grade.[55] Since the inception of PSA screening, several events have occurred: (1) a contemporaneous, but unrelated decrease in detections of transition-zone tumors caused by a fall in the number of transurethral resections of the prostate due to the advent of effective treatment for benign prostatic hyperplasia (including alpha blockers and finasteride); and (2) an increase in detection of peripheral-zone tumors due to the incorporation of transrectal ultrasound-guided prostate biopsies.
As transition-zone tumors are predominantly low-volume and low-grade and as peripheral-zone tumors have a preponderance of moderate-grade and high-grade disease, the proportion of higher-grade tumors detected by current screening practices has increased substantially.
A Detroit study found that between 1989 through 1996, poorly-differentiated tumors remained stable and well-differentiated tumors fell in frequency while moderately-differentiated disease increased in frequency.
The largest rise in incidence was in clinically localized disease.[56] It is possible, however, that there was a shift in diagnostic criteria over this period.
Factors That May Influence PSA Levels
Diet
A significant body of evidence suggests that a diet high in fat, especially saturated fats and fats of animal origin, is associated with a higher risk of prostate cancer.[57,58] Other possible dietary influences include selenium, vitamin E, vitamin D, lycopene, and isoflavones.[59]
Family History
In a Finnish study of 2,099 prostate cancer patients, 302 individuals were identified with 2 or more family members affected by prostate cancer.[60] Two hundred nine asymptomatic men from these families were studied to determine the frequency of test abnormality and prostate cancer incidence.
Serum PSA was elevated in 10% and prostate cancer or high-grade prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia (PIN) were identified in 3.3% and 1%, respectively.
The risk of elevated PSA or ultimate diagnosis of prostate cancer was greatest among families with a history of prostate cancer development before age 60.
A similar study was conducted in Sweden and evaluated 5,706 sons of Swedish men who had been diagnosed with prostate cancer between 1959 and 1963.
While the cumulative risk of developing prostate cancer in the general population by ages 60, 70 and 80 were 0.45%, 3%, and 10%, respectively, the associated age-specific risks for sons of men with prostate cancer were 5%, 15%, and 30%, respectively.[61]
Race
The impact of race on PSA and tumor volume was evaluated in a large series of patients undergoing radical prostatectomy in whom whole-mount histology was used for the prostate sections.
After adjustment for age, stage, pathologic stage, Gleason score, and volume of benign disease, PSA and tumor volume were both higher among African American men.[62]
Physician Behaviors Related to Screening
A variety of variables affect the likelihood of a recommendation for prostate cancer screening from a physician.
One thousand three hundred sixty-nine primary care physicians in Washington State were surveyed to determine patterns of PSA screening.
Of the 714 respondents, 68% routinely recommended PSA screening; the survey results suggest that gender (male), age (medical school graduation before 1974), and mode of reimbursement (fee for service) all increase the likelihood of PSA screening among this population.[63]
Providing Information to the Public, to Patients, and to Their Families
A number of investigators have studied knowledge and preferences of men and their families with regards to prostate cancer screening.
One of the most comprehensive analyses interviewed physicians, patients, and their families regarding the sort of information they each felt should be made available prior to prostate cancer screening with PSA and DRE.
The investigator found that each group could reach consensus on the minimum amount of information that should be made available to a patient to help him decide whether to have PSA or DRE screening for prostate cancer.[64]
Randomized Prospective Clinical Trials of Screening for Prostate Cancer
While 2 large randomized clinical trials are currently ongoing to assess whether early detection of prostate cancer can reduce mortality from the disease,[65,66] a Canadian trial has been published that was reported to have been performed in a randomized prospective manner.
In this study, 46,193 men, identified from the electoral rolls of Quebec City and its metropolitan area, were randomized to either be approached for PSA and DRE screening or not.
A total of 30,956 men were randomized to screening while a total of 15,237 were randomized to observation.
(It appears that these men were unaware that they had been randomized in a clinical trial.)
A notable difference from other screening studies was that a PSA of 3.0 ng/ml was used to determine whether further evaluation was warranted.
In this study, of the 30,956 men who were randomized to screening, 7,155 actually underwent screening while 23,801 did not.
Of the 15,237 who were randomized to observation, 982 actually underwent screening while 14,255 did not.
One hundred thirty-seven deaths were noted among the 38,056 men who did not undergo screening compared to only 5 deaths among the 8,137 men who underwent screening.
Using an intention-to-treat analysis based upon the study arm to which the individual was originally randomized, however, there was no difference in mortality (there were 73 deaths among the 15,237 men who were randomized to observation compared to 140 deaths among the 31,300 randomized to screening.)
Because of noncompliance, this study does not answer the question whether early detection with PSA and DRE will reduce prostate cancer mortality.[67]
Population Observations on Early Detection, Incidence, and Prostate Cancer Mortality
While DRE has been a staple of medical practice for many decades, PSA did not come into common use until about 1988 for the early diagnosis of prostate cancer.
Following the national dissemination of the practice of early detection, incidence rates rose abruptly.
In a study of medicare beneficiaries, a first-time PSA test was associated with a 4.7% likelihood of a prostate cancer diagnosis within 3 months.
Subsequent tests were associated with statistically significantly lower rates of prostate cancer diagnosis.[68]
In an examination of trends of prostate cancer detection and diagnosis among 140,936 white and 15,662 African American men diagnosed with prostate cancer between 1973 and 1994 in the National Cancer InstituteÃ¯Â¿Â½s (NCI) Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) database, substantial changes were found beginning in the late 1980s as use of PSA diffused through the United States.
As the test diffused, age at diagnosis fell, stage of disease at diagnosis decreased, and most tumors were noted to be moderately differentiated.
For African American men, however, a larger proportion of tumors were poorly differentiated.[69]
Since the outset of PSA screening, beginning around 1988, incidence rates initially rose dramatically and then fell, presumably as the fraction of the population undergoing their first PSA screening initially rose and subsequently fell.
There has also been a decrease observed in mortality rates.
In Olmsted County, Minnesota, for example, age-adjusted prostate cancer mortality rates increased from 25.8 per 100,000 men in the population during the period 1980 to 1984 to a peak of 34 per 100,000 during 1989 to 1992; they subsequently decreased to 19.4 per 100,000 during 1993 to 1997.[70] Similar observations have been made elsewhere in the world,[71,72]
In Canada (Quebec province), however, examinations of the association between the size of the rise in incidence rates (from 1989 to 1993) and the size of the decrease in mortality rates (from 1995 to 1999), by birth cohort and residential grouping, showed no correlation between these 2 variables.[72] This study suggests that, at least over this time frame, the decline in mortality is not related to widespread PSA testing.
Since the evidence in this respect is inconsistent, it remains unclear whether the cause of these mortality trends is chance, early detection, improved treatments, or a combination of effects.
The incidence of distant-stage prostate carcinoma was relatively flat until 1991 and then started declining rapidly.
This decline probably was caused by the shift to earlier-stage disease associated with the rapid dissemination of prostate-specific antigen (PSA) screening.
This stage shift can have a fairly sizable and rapid impact on population mortality, but it is possible that other factors, such as hormonal therapy, are responsible for much of the decline in mortality.
Ongoing randomized clinical trials in the United States and Europe are designed to determine if there is a mortality benefit associated with PSA screening.[73]
Simulation Models
A computer simulation model has been developed to analyze the trends in prostate cancer detection (PSA screening beginning in approximately 1988) to compare these trends with the reported fall in prostate cancer deaths observed between 1992 and 1994.
The level of screening efficacy was hypothesized to be similar to those postulated in the Prostate, Lung, Colorectal, and Ovarian cancer study.
The changes in prostate cancer mortality could not be explained entirely by PSA screening alone.[74] Cause-of-death-misclassification was studied as a possible explanation for changes in prostate cancer mortality.
A relatively fixed rate was found at which individuals who have been diagnosed with prostate cancer are mislabeled as dying from prostate cancer.
As such, the substantial increase in prostate cancer diagnoses in the late 1980s and early 1990s would then explain the increased rate of prostate cancer death during those years.
As the rate of prostate cancer diagnosis fell in the early 1990s, this reduced rate of mislabeling death as due to prostate cancer would fall as would the overall rate of prostate cancer death.[75]
Rigorous evaluation of any prostate cancer screening modality is desirable because the natural history of the disease is variable and appropriate treatment is not clearly defined.[43,76,77] Further, there is a possibility of unnecessary morbidity associated with diagnosis and treatment of many prostate cancer lesions.
A meta-analysis of 6 expectant series demonstrates that patients with low-grade disease experience prolonged survival with deferred therapy.[78] The incidence of prostate cancer found at autopsy steadily increases for each decade after age 50 years, and many of these lesions are clinically silent.
Some progress has been made in predicting the biologic behavior of these tumors, but despite improved understanding of the biologic potential of prostate cancer as it relates to histologic grade and tumor volume, the necessity to diagnose or treat a given case of prostate cancer cannot be proven at this time.
Decision analyses using the Markov model yield variable treatment outcomes due to the uncertainty regarding metastatic rates expected for prostate cancer and uncertainty about treatment efficacy.[79-81] A review of 59,876 men with prostate cancer diagnosed between 1983 and 1992 and registered by the SEER registries, however, shows that treatment of men with poorly-differentiated and moderately-differentiated disease is associated with an improved survival rate compared to observation.[82]
The information from Swedish studies of expectant therapy lead to different conclusions depending on methodology and populations used in analysis.[83] Screening and subsequent treatment of a large number of detected prostate cancers could have substantial risks and morbidity that include urinary incontinence, urethral strictures, erectile dysfunction, rectal injury, and a small but finite incidence of treatment-related mortality.[84,85]
The use of androgen deprivation therapy, either as primary or neoadjuvant therapy, for localized prostate cancer has increased markedly in the last decade.
An observational database of 7,195 patients with prostate cancer, including 3,439 men diagnosed since 1989, with clinical staging information available was reviewed.
It was observed that patients with clinically localized prostate cancer are increasingly receiving androgen deprivation therapy with either radical prostatectomy, radiation therapy, or brachytherapy, although the appropriate role of hormonal therapy in localized disease is unknown.
The full impact of increased hormonal therapy on prostate cancer mortality patterns is unknown.[87]
A simulation model based on available evidence suggests that if there is a benefit to screening, this benefit decreases with age.[88] No trial of prostate cancer screening in which the intervention arms were analyzed as randomized (analogous to an Ã¯Â¿Â½intention to treatÃ¯Â¿Â½ analysis in a treatment trial) has been reported.
There is insufficient evidence on which to decide the efficacy of transrectal ultrasound and serum tumor markers (including PSA) for routine screening in asymptomatic men.[79,84] While awaiting results of current studies, physicians and men (and their partners) are faced with the dilemma of whether or not to recommend or request a screening test.
A qualitative study undertaken on focus groups of men, physician experts, and couples with screened and unscreened men has explored what information may help to inform a man undertaking a decision regarding PSA screening.[64] At a minimum, men should be informed about the possibility that false-positive or false-negative test results can occur, that it is not known whether regular screening will reduce deaths from prostate cancer, and, among experts, the recommendation to screen is controversial.
An NCI multicenter trial is ongoing to test the effect of early detection by digital rectal examination and PSA on reducing mortality.
A trial of screening is also being performed in Europe.[65,89]
