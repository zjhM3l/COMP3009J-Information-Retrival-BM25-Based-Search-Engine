Section 41708 by submitting inaccurate Form 251 reports; and it violated 14 CFR 399.84 by advertising fares which failed to state the total price to be paid.
By engaging in the conduct described and by failing to disclose the fact that advertised fares were subject to capacity controls, were not completely refundable, and were subject to cancellation and change in itinerary fees, Tower Air, Inc. violated 49 U.S.C.
Section 41712.
Therefore, Tower Air, Inc., and all other entities owned or controlled by or under common ownership with Tower Air, Inc., and their successors and assignees are ordered to cease and desist from further violations and Tower Air, Inc. is assessed $90,000 in compromise of the potential civil penalties that might otherwise be assessed for the violations.
