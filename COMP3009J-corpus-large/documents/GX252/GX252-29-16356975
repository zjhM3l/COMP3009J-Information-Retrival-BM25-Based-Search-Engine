Drug Control Program Logo Department of Public Health For Immediate Release Contact: Sean Fitzpatrick August 2, 1996 (617) 624-5200 __________________________________________________________________ DPH Issues Advisory on Herbal Dietary Supplements Containing Ephedra Boston-- The Department of Public Health has issued a warning about the danger of herbal dietary supplements containing ephedrine or ephedra (plant product forms of ephedrine which are commonly labeled as "ma huang").
According to Commissioner David Mulligan: "These products which are often promoted with claims of increased athletic performance, body building muscle gains, energy 'boosts' or a natural high, may pose a significant health risk to consumers."
The U.S. Food and Drug Administration has received reports of approximately 600 adverse events involving ephedra, including a number of deaths that are actively being investigated.
One of these deaths occurred in Massachusetts and involved the consumption of a thermogenic protein drink containing ma huang extract marketed over the counter in health food stores to increase athletic performance and muscle building.
While some of the herbal products such as "herbal ecstasy" are marketed to appear as "legal" alternatives to street drugs, many of the products such as the one involved in the Massachusetts case, are marketed towards health-conscious individuals with claims of increased athletic performance, body building muscle gains and energy boosts.
The Department of Public Health is warning consumers not to consume any of the ecstasy-type products which are promoted as giving a natural "high" similar to illegal street drugs.
Consumers are further cautioned not to consume herbal dietary supplements containing ephedra for increasing general health or athletic performances unless they have consulted a physician.
Ephedrine is a stimulant that can have adverse effects on the heart and central nervous system ranging from dizziness and rapid heart beat to psychosis and heart attack.
A recently obtained death certificate for the Massachusett's case indicated that a 23 year old college student died on April 19, 1996, of a heart problem (myocardial necrosis) associated with ephedrine toxicity from the ingestion of a protein drink containing ma huang extract.
Commissioner Mulligan stated that "The Department is pursuing additional information from the medical community, and is requesting that any cases of adverse effects related to these products be brought immediately to our attention."
Ephedrine is available as a manufactured synthetic drug and is a constituent of a number of FDA approved medications for use as a bronchodilator, to make breathing easier, and is most commonly packaged in over-the-counter drug products.
The dietary supplements containing "ephedra" or "ma huang" are not approved as drugs by the FDA, and their safety is being questioned.
A federal law passed in 1994, the Dietary Supplement Health and Education Act (DSHEA) permits these dietary supplements to be marked without proof of safety.
FDA is only permitted to act after the marketed dietary supplement has been proven to be unsafe.
Due to the growing number of adverse effects reprted to FDA nationally, including the Massachusetts case, our Department is working closely with FDA and the medical community to review additional regulatory actions that may be taken concerning dietary supplements that contain ephedrine, especially those that might also contain the stimulant caffeine.
Individuals who have experienced adverse health effects should contact the Department of Public Health's Division of Food and Drugs at (617) 727-2670.
