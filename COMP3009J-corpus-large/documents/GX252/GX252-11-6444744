June 1998 Dear Reader, It gives us great pleasure to share with you EPAs Childrens Environmental Health Yearbook representing the United States Environmental Protection Agencys (EPA) current actions to protect children from environmental hazards.
It contains the latest information on the unique threats environmental hazards present to children and describes EPAs efforts to combat these hazards.
It is our hope that this report will be a valuable resource for the public.
The special susceptibility of children to certain environmental hazards as well as the changing nature of childhood illness have prompted the Clinton Administration to make childrens health a high priority.
In September 1996, the EPA established a seven step National Agenda to Protect Childrens Health from Environmental Threats.
In April 1997, President Clinton issued an Executive Order requiring all federal agencies to make the protection of children a high priority in implementing their statutory responsibilities and fulfilling their overall missions.
The Office of Childrens Health Protection (OCHP) was created to coordinate childrens health issues across EPA.
The volume and breadth of this report demonstrate the hard work taking place in the Agency to focus significant attention on protecting childrens health.
This work illustrates the commitment by EPA employees to safeguarding children against environmental hazards.
The Clinton Administrations focus on children will continue to grow, reflecting an enduring effort to protecting the health of children.
Sincerely,
Carol M. Browner

Introduction Our Childrens World Our children live in a world much different from the one in which we were raised.
In recent decades, about 50,000 synthetic chemicals have been produced in the United States and many have dispersed into the environment.(1) Now that many of the childhood diseases prevalent in the past can be prevented or controlled with vaccines and antibiotics, there has been a shift to treating more chronic conditions.
These conditions include, for example, asthma, learning disabilities, birth defects, and childhood cancers.
An estimated 4.8 million children under 18 years of age have asthma.(2,3) About 150,000 children with asthma are hospitalized each year, and 600 die from the disease.(4) Asthma treatment was estimated to cost $6.2 billion in 1990; today this figure is expected to be substantially higher because of the increase in disease incidence and medical costs.(5) The overall frequency of childhood cancer has increased over the past two decades.(6,7) The trends in some cancer rates suggest the need for a closer examination of the underlying causes of cancer in children.
This includes determining the role environmental contaminants may play in causing disease.
Special Vulnerabilities Children may have a special vulnerability to certain toxic substances, such as lead.
Their vulnerability exists for a variety of reasons.
For instance, children may be more heavily exposed to certain toxic substances in the environment than adults.
Pound for pound of body weight, children breathe more air, drink more water, and eat more food than adults.
In addition, their behavior patterns, such as play close to the ground and hand-to-mouth activities, can increase their exposure to potential toxics in the environment.
Furthermore, the systems of a childs body are still developing making children less able to metabolize, detoxify, and excrete some toxic substances than adults.
However, it is not unusual for children to be less sensitive or respond differently than adults to medicines and other chemicals.(8,9) Our understanding of childrens vulnerability to toxic substances is complicated because the degree of vulnerability varies with age and developmental stage.
EPA Takes Action In recognition of these factors, Administrator Carol Browner directed the Environmental Protection Agency in the fall of 1995 to explicitly and consistently take into account environmental health risks to infants and children in all risk characterizations and public

health standards set for the United States.
In the fall of 1996, the Administrator announced a seven-step National Agenda to Protect Childrens Health from Environmental Threats.
This National Agenda Instructs the Agency to: Ensure that all standards set by EPA are protective of any heightened risks faced by children.
Develop a scientific research strategy focused on the gaps in knowledge regarding child-specific susceptibility and exposure to environmental pollutants.
Develop new, comprehensive policies to address cumulative and simultaneous exposures faced by children.
Expand community right-to-know allowing families to make informed choices concerning environmental exposures to their children.
Encourage parental responsibility for protecting their children from environmental health threats by providing them with basic information.
Encourage and expand educational efforts with health care providers and environmental professionals so they can identify, prevent, and reduce environmental health threats to children.
Provide the necessary funding to address childrens environmental health as a top priority among relative health risks.
President Acts on Behalf of Children On April 21, 1997, President Clinton signed the Executive Order on the Protection of Children from Environmental Health Risks and Safety Risks.
This Executive Order requires all federal agencies to assign a high priority to addressing health and safety risks to children, coordinate research priorities on childrens health, and ensure that their standards take into account special risks to children.
The Executive Order creates a Task Force on Environmental Health Risks and Safety Risks to Children that will establish a coordinated research agenda and enlist public input for these efforts.
EPA Launches New Office In May 1997, Administrator Browner established the Office of Childrens Health Protection (OCHP) to support the Agency as it implements the Presidents Executive Order as well as the National Agenda to Protect Childrens Health from Environmental Threats.
The mission of OCHP is to make the protection of childrens health a fundamental
Introduction

The EPA Childrens Environmental Health Yearbook
goal of public health and environmental protection in the United States.
OCHP will support and facilitate Agency efforts to protect childrens health from environmental threats.
This Childrens Environmental Health Yearbook highlights EPA activities that protect childrens health from environmental hazards and is among the first projects of the new office.
Office of Childrens Health Protection Highlights U EPA Administrator, Carol Browner, convened the first federal conference addressing the preventable causes of childhood cancer on September 15 and 16, 1997.
Recommendations for a research agenda included a call for a National Childhood Cancer Registry and standardizing information, such as exposure history and family health data.
U EPA and the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) are establishing federally funded research centers dedicated to the protection of childrens health from environmental threats.
The centers will focus on the environmental causes of childrens illnesses and disorders.
They will seek an understanding of the mechanisms of respiratory disease, such as asthma, and they will study the effects of environmental contaminants, such as lead, mercury, and polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), on intellectual and physical development.
Also, they will institute new community-based partnerships for prevention.
U The Office of Childrens Health Protection chairs an EPA Board on Childrens Environmental Health that will ensure the integration of Agency activities affecting children and serve as a catalyst for actions that will protect children.
U Administrator Browner and Health and Human Services Secretary Donna Shalala co-chair the Task Force on Environmental Health Risks and Safety Risks to Children.
On October 9, 1997, the Task Force met to implement President Clintons Executive Order.
Work groups were established to coordinate federal data needs and research and to facilitate childrens environmental health programs across the federal agencies.
U A Federal Advisory Committee on Childrens Health Protection has been established.
This broad-based committee will advise EPA on childrens environmental health issues as it develops regulations, guidance, and policies; communicates with the public; and conducts research.
EPA has already begun to fulfill the requirements of the National Agenda and Executive Order.
Some of the more visible examples include certain updated air quality standards, implementation of the 1996 Safe Drinking Water Act (SDWA) Amendments, and the 1996 Food Quality Protection Act Amendments to the Food Drug and Cosmetic Act.
The Clinton Administrations 1997 air standards for particulate matter and ozone provide additional health protection to 35 million children and set standards for fine particulate matter for the first time.(10) The strengthening of the ozone standard is expected to result in one million fewer incidents of decreased lung function in children each year.(11)

Introduction
The EPA Childrens Environmental Health Yearbook
The 1996 Food Quality Protection Act contains specific provisions to protect the health of infants and children in the absence of complete data on the harmful effects of pesticides.
It also calls for the re-evaluation of nearly 10,000 existing pesticide tolerances within a ten-year period.
Pesticide tolerances are the levels of pesticide residues that the government allows in food.
The 1996 SDWA Amendments include a new focus on setting priorities based on risk.
EPA will decide which waterborne contaminants to regulate under the SDWA based on data about the health risks the contaminant may pose, its likely occurrence in public water systems, and the projected benefit of reducing the risk.
EPA will identify groups of sensitive people, called subpopulations, who are at greater risk than the general public from exposure to drinking water contaminants.
These sensitive subpopulations include infants, children, pregnant women, the elderly, and people with weakened immune systems.
The goal is to protect the people who are most sensitive to each contaminant and assure that the health of children is protected.
The principles of environmental justicethat all people must have the opportunity to live in a healthy environment and that environmental laws apply without discrimination based on race, ethnicity, culture, or economic statusguide EPAs efforts to increase and improve access to education programs for the poor, immigrants, and ethnic and racial minorities.
A great many EPA childrens health projects target urban environmental problems and tribal health threats.
Organization of this Report The EPA Childrens Environmental Health Yearbook is meant to be a resource guide of EPA activities for the public and a tool for the Agency to use in protecting childrens health from environmental hazards.
The Yearbook includes sections on asthma and other respiratory effects; childhood cancer; developmental and neurological toxicity; health effects of pesticides; and potential risk from contaminated surface water and ground water.
Additional chapters describe improvements in predicting health risks to children, highlight international activities to protect children, identify environmental education programs addressing issues of childrens health, and describe EPAs expansion of individuals and families right-to-know about environmental hazards.
Each chapter outlines EPA efforts to address potential environmental health threats.
EPA projects may relate to more than one health effect or risk.
For instance, even though most of the environmental tobacco smoke projects are summarized in the chapter on asthma and respiratory effects, the same projects are also relevant to the childhood cancer chapter.

The brief descriptions of EPA projects include contacts for more information.
The final section directs readers to additional EPA resources for more information.
The Yearbook identifies areas where research has established a link between a harmful health effect and exposure to a contaminant.
Two examples are the effect of lead on the brains of young children and of nitrates on the oxygenation of infants.
The Yearbook also includes a discussion of environmental contaminants where a link between exposure and adverse health effects may only be suspected in childrennot proven, especially at the low levels of contamination generally found in the environment.
Harmful effects from exposure to contaminants during childhood might not manifest themselves until later in life.
EPA is focusing significant attention on protecting childrens health, as demonstrated in this Yearbook.
However, much basic and applied research remains to be done to establish or refute links between exposure to environmental factors and specific health effects.
EPA is conducting research to better understand and prevent environmental health risks.

Asthma and Other Respiratory Effects Definition Asthma is a narrowing of the airways in the lung that produces difficulty in breathing.
Asthma attacks are commonly set off by triggers in children who have a genetic or acquired predisposition to the disease.
Several major triggers are household dust mites (microscopic insects that live on dust), certain foods, lung and upper airway irritants (such as cigarette smoke, smog, soot, and pollen), strong fumes, respiratory infections, cold or windy weather conditions, and, occasionally, emotions or exercise that cause deep or rapid breathing.(1) The triggers may set off a chain of reactions leading to a narrowing of the airways in the lung and inflammation of mucus membranes.
These reactions, in turn, cause coughing, wheezing, chest tightness, shortness of breath, and increased risk of respiratory infections.
Asthmatic episodes may last for hours or several days, and severely restrict the ability of a child to live a normal life.
Childhood Asthma Facts U An estimated 4.8 million children under 18 years of age have asthma and many more have hidden, or undiag-
nosed, asthma.(2,3) U Asthma is the leading chronic illness in children of the United States and the leading cause of school absenteeism due to chronic illness.(4) U Six hundred children die each year from asthma, and 150,000 are hospitalized.(5) U From 1980 to 1993, the death rate for childhood asthma in the United States increased by 78 percent.(5) U Asthma treatment cost an estimated $6.2 billion in 1990.(6) U Asthma-related hospitalizations have risen disproportionately for inner-city children, and in particular for minority
populations.(7,8)
Childhood asthma is a disorder with genetic predispositions and a strong allergic component.
Approximately 75 to 80 percent of children with asthma have significant allergies.(1) Allergens, such as household dust mites, tobacco, pet dander, insects, molds, and pollen, are substances that may trigger allergic reactions and subsequent asthma attacks.

Asthma and Other Respiratory Effects
The EPA Childrens Environmental Health Yearbook
Possible Environmental Factors Poor indoor and outdoor air quality have been linked with asthma symptoms as well as with other respiratory problems, such as an increased frequency of respiratory infections, bronchitis, and pneumonia in children.(8)
Indoor Air Pollutants People in industrialized nations spend 90 percent of their time indoors.(9) The home, school, and daycare center where children spend most of their time are the locations of highest concern for exposure to indoor air pollutants.
A recent series of Government Accounting Office (GAO) reports found that both new and old primary and secondary school buildings need rehabilitation.
Older buildings often contain materials with hazardous substances, such as asbestos and lead.
Newer buildings and furnishings may contain formaldehyde and strong fumes.
Several of the most common indoor air pollutants in homes, schools, and daycare centers are described below.
Environmental Tobacco Smoke (Secondhand Smoke) The Centers for Disease Control and Preventions (CDC) National Center for Environmental Health reports that 43 percent of children, two months through 11 years of age, live in a home with at least one smoker.(10) Children who live with smokers involuntarily inhale many pollutants in smoke.
Environmental tobacco smoke (ETS), also known as secondhand smoke, is a complex mixture of more than 4,000 chemicals,including carbon monoxide, nicotine, tars, formaldehyde, and hydrogen cyanide.(11) Several of these chemicals are known human carcinogens or respiratory irritants.(12) Children exposed to ETS tend to have more bronchitis, pneumonia, respiratory infections, otitis media (fluid in the middle ear), and asthma symptoms.(13) The frequency of infection depends directly on the amount of smoke in the home.
Children who live with two smoking parents have more respiratory infections than children who live with one smoking parent.
The lowest rates of respiratory infections and asthma are found in children of parents who do not smoke at all.
Maternal smoking during pregnancy is associated with an increased incidence of Sudden Infant Death Syndrome.(13,14,15) EPA estimates that between 150,000 and 300,000 cases of lung infections, such as bronchitis and pneumonia, that occur annually in infants and young children up to 18 months of age may be attributed to exposure to ETS.
Of these, 7,500 to 15,000 will result in hospitalization.(13) ETS exposure aggravates the condition of between 200,000 and 1,000,000 asthmatic children.(14) EPA has found that ETS increases fluid in the middle ear, a sign of chronic middle ear disease, the most common cause of hospitalization for surgery in children.(13)
Asthma and Other Respiratory Effects
Page 8

The CDC estimates that children exposed to tobacco smoke in their homes have 18 million more days of restricted activity, 10 million more days of bed confinement, and miss 7 million more school days annually than other children, primarily due to acute and chronic respiratory conditions.(16) Allergens Allergens, especially those containing biological matter, such as house dust mites, cockroaches, pet dander, pollen, molds, spores, bacteria, and viruses, are known to cause or aggravate asthma.(1) Allergic reactions often combine with and seriously aggravate the symptoms of asthma, the common cold, pneumonia, and other conditions.
Allergens also may cause eye, nose and throat irritation, shortness of breath, dizziness, lethargy, and fever.
Volatile Organic Compounds Volatile organic compounds (VOCs) are chemicals that can volatilize (evaporate) from substances, such as cleaning products, adhesives, paints, dry-cleaning fluids, and wood preservatives.(17) VOCs can be emitted from these products into the air and may be trapped indoors, especially in tightly sealed buildings.
An EPA study of six communities in various parts of the United States found that indoor levels of VOCs are up to ten times higher than outdoor levels.
Symptoms of VOC exposure may include eye, nose and lung irritation, rash, headache, nausea, vomiting, and asthma.
Exposure to some VOCs, such as benzene and vinyl chloride, may cause cancer.
Formaldehyde, a common VOC, is a colorless, strong-smelling gas used in pressed wood (particle board, fiberboard, and plywood), paints, coatings, cosmetics, fabrics, and insulation materials.(18) Formaldehyde is released into the air from these products as well as from burning wood, kerosene, or natural gas, and from automobiles and cigarettes.
Formaldehyde causes cancer in laboratory animals and is considered by EPA to be a probable human carcinogen.
Although formaldehyde affects people differently, it may irritate the eyes, nasal sinuses, throat, and lungs, and may trigger asthma.
Children and adults have developed allergic reactions, including hives, from exposure to the gas.
Nitrogen Oxides Nitrogen oxides are more often thought of as outdoor air pollutants emitted by motor vehicles and fossil-fuel burning power plants, but they also are found indoors.
Inadequately vented gas ranges, gas pilot lights, gas or kerosene heaters, and welding activities, as well as tobacco smoke, contribute to nitrogen oxides in indoor air.
Because they are potent respiratory irritants, they may aggravate asthma and other respiratory diseases.(19)
Page 9
Asthma and Other Respiratory Effects
The EPA Childrens Environmental Health Yearbook
Carbon Monoxide Carbon monoxide is a colorless, odorless gas produced from the incomplete burning of virtually any combustible product.
It may accumulate indoors as a result of tobacco smoking, poorly ventilated appliances, and attached garages.
Carbon monoxide enters the blood from the lungs and combines with hemoglobin, blocking the bloods ability to carry oxygen to body cells.
Symptoms of carbon monoxide exposure may mimic influenza and include fatigue, headache, dizziness, nausea and vomiting, mental confusion, and rapid heart rate.
Depending on the level of exposure, carbon monoxide can be immediately fatal.
Long-term, low-level exposures to carbon monoxide by pregnant women have the potential to injure the developing fetus.(20)
Outdoor Air Pollutants Urban air pollution appears to be a contributor to current increases in asthma incidence.
In 1995, thirty-three percent of the U.S. population lived in counties that did not meet EPA air quality standards for ozone (the principal component of smog), carbon monoxide, nitrogen dioxide (one of the nitrogen oxides), sulfur dioxide, particulate matter (soot), and lead.(21) Although any of the outdoor air pollutants may play a role in increased asthma attacks, ozone is the pollutant consistently associated with aggravating the disease.
High ozone levels also are associated with a reduction in lung function in children without asthma.(22) The American Lung Association determined that children with asthma are 40 percent more likely to suffer asthma attacks on high-pollution days compared to days with average pollution levels.
A recent study linked exposure to particulate matter with an increased risk of death to newborns from respiratory problems and Sudden Infant Death Syndrome.(23) Children are especially vulnerable to the effects of ozone and particulate matter.(24,25) Except for the very young, children typically spend more time outdoors than do adults, especially in the summer when ozone and particulate levels are the highest.
Children also spend more time engaged in vigorous activity, which results in more outside air being taken into their lungs.
Their activity, combined with the higher breathing rate of children relative to their body weight and lung surface area, results in a greater dose of pollutant delivered to their lungs.
Air pollution that would produce only slight breathing difficulties in an adult may contribute to a more serious breathing problem in a young child because children have smaller airways.

Summary of EPA Activities Improving Indoor Air Quality (IAQ) EPA has joined with numerous nonprofit organizations, states, and educational systems to develop indoor air quality programs that offer workshops, distribute educational materials, and conduct media campaigns, home audits, and school inspections.
EPA has developed an easy-to-use guide called the Indoor Air Quality (IAQ) Tools for Schools Action Kit.
The kit empowers schools to carry out a practical plan of action to prevent and resolve indoor air quality problems at little or no cost using simple activities and in-house staff.
Extensive efforts are underway by EPA regional offices to distribute the IAQ Tools for Schools materials and assist schools in implementing an IAQ program.
Many national advocacy organizations are promoting the kit as an easy and effective program for minimizing adverse health effects.
With more than 20,000 kits distributed nationwide since 1996 to kindergarten through high schools, strong support for the program has been voiced by state departments of education and health.
Several state legislatures are using the kit as a guide to develop indoor air quality standards in schools.
To determine whether IAQ Tools for Schools is improving air quality, EPA is measuring changes in symptoms, staff perceptions of the quality of indoor air, reductions in pollutant levels, and improvements in ventilation system performance.
Participating schools undergo before-and-after testing over a one-year period.
Throughout the year, EPA monitors the progress of specific activities, as well as their costs.
EPA also is working with the American Lung Association to implement the Open Airways program among high-risk, inner-city minority children who have higher-than-average asthma death rates.
The Open Airways curriculum teaches children to manage their own symptoms and has been completed by over 22,000 children.
This year, Open Airways training will be combined with the IAQ Tools for Schools program.
Training will result in an additional 25,000 children graduating from the Open Airways program and 1,500 schools implementing the IAQ Tools for Schools guidance.
EPA is collaborating with the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services to educate the public about the dangers of ETS and has embarked on a national public education campaign designed to reduce childrens exposure to ETS. EPA has enlisted the help of daycare operators and pediatricians in educating parents about the dangers of ETS in the home.
They also are teaching parents about techniques for avoiding exposure to substances that may trigger asthma and other respiratory illnesses.

Although much is known about typical childhood activity patterns, less is known about the physical characteristics of childrens lungs that make them more susceptible to the effects of airborne pollutants.
EPA is conducting various studies to improve the understanding of this relationship.
Improving Outdoor Air Quality EPAs efforts to control outdoor air pollution are focused on protecting everyone, including children, from the harmful effects of ozone, particulate matter, and toxic substances.
The Agency develops standards that set safe limits for the most prevalent air pollutants, and works with the states to implement those standards.
In July 1997, the Clinton Administration strengthened the ozone standard from 120 parts per billion (ppb) averaged over one hour to 80 ppb averaged over eight hours.
This new limit was proposed to respond to scientific evidence that previous standards, established 20 years ago, do not adequately protect sensitive populations such as asthmatics and children, from the effects of ozone.
These new regulations also established standards for fine airborne particles for the first time.
EPA estimates that the new standards will save at least 15,000 lives per year and protect an additional 35 million children.
EPAs regional offices have begun various outreach efforts to emphasize the increased susceptibility of children to certain air pollutantsparticularly ground-level ozone.
These efforts include daily Internet postings on predicted air quality ratings, health effects fact sheets (available in several languages), and media campaigns.
The air in schools in industrial areas is being monitored to further identify and measure air contaminants.
EPA is measuring the impact of outdoor air pollutants on the physical development of children.

Childhood Cancer Definition Approximately 8,000 children under the age of 15 are diagnosed with cancer each year in the United States.(1) In 1992, cancer was the fourth leading cause of death for American children under age 15, exceeded only by deaths from accidents, congenital anomalies (birth defects), and diseases of infancy.(2,3) The most prevalent forms of the disease in children are leukemia and brain cancer.(4) The death rate from childhood cancer in the United States has declined dramatically in recent years due to improved treatment.(5) However, the overall incidence rate of new cancers in children has increased as shown in the table below.(6,7) The trends in some cancer types suggest the need for a closer examination of the underlying factors leading to disease in children.
This includes determining whether environmental contaminants play a role in causing the disease.
Incidence of Childhood Cancer New Cases per 100,000/yr
r = 0.75
Year Incidence of cancer in children by calendar year of diagnosis, 1973-1994, United States, SEER (data from Table 27-3).
The correlation coefficient, r, is 0.75
Cancer is characterized by the uncontrolled growth of cells.
When a cell becomes cancerous, it loses its ability to regulate its own growth, control cell division, and interpret messages from other cells.
Each tumor is believed to originate from a single cell gone awry.
The transformation of a normal cell into a cancerous one requires a series of alterations often involving mutations in DNA, the genetic code.
This stepwise series of
Page 33
Childhood Cancer
The EPA Childrens Environmental Health Yearbook
changes usually takes many years to complete, although in young children, the sequence may be accelerated.
In addition to possibly causing childhood cancer, exposure to a carcinogen as a child may lead to cancer as an adult.
Carcinogens are substances that trigger or accelerate the development of cancer.
Cancer may be initiated or accelerated by radiation and by some toxic chemicals.
Possible Environmental Factors Exposures to certain carcinogens in the environment may be associated with some human cancers.(8,9) People can be exposed to carcinogens through many routes, including air, water, food, drugs, surface contact, and tobacco use.
Examples of environmental factors that may be associated with cancer are:(4,9,10) Environmental tobacco smoke (or secondhand smoke) Radon Asbestos Ultraviolet light Some hazardous waste Some pesticides Indoor air toxics are addressed more fully in Chapter 2 and pesticides in Chapter 5 of this report.
Environmental Tobacco Smoke (Secondhand Smoke) Infants and children who live in households with smokers involuntarily inhale the toxic substances in tobacco smoke.
Environmental tobacco smoke (ETS) is a complex mixture of more than 4,000 chemicals, such as nicotine, tars, formaldehyde, and hydrogen cyanide.(11) Some of these contaminants are known human carcinogens.(12) More information on childrens risks resulting from toxic substances in ETS is presented in Chapter 2 Asthma and Other Respiratory Effects.
Radon Radon, a known human carcinogen, is a naturally occurring, radioactive gas that is colorless, odorless, and tasteless.
It comes from the natural decay of uranium, a radioactive metal found in soil and rock in the earths crust all over the United States.
Radon travels through soil and enters the indoor environments of buildings through cracks and other openings in the foundation.
Eventually, radon decays into radioactive particles that can be
Childhood Cancer
Page 34
The EPA Childrens Environmental Health Yearbook
inhaled and then trapped in the lungs.
As these particles decay, they release small bursts of radiation that can damage lung tissue and lead to lung cancer later in life.(13) EPA estimates that radon may cause from 7,000 to 30,000 lung cancer deaths in the United States each year.
Radon is the second leading cause of lung cancer deaths in adults, after smoking.
An individuals risk of getting lung cancer from radon depends mainly on three factors: the level of radon, duration of exposure, and smoking habits.
Risk increases in individuals exposed to high levels of radon over a long time.
The risk of dying from lung cancer caused by radon is much greater for smokers than for nonsmokers.
Asbestos Asbestos is a fibrous mineral that was used widely in construction materials, such as shingles for roofing and siding, pipe and boiler insulation, floor tiles, ceiling panels, coatings, and gaskets.
It is present in schools and other public buildings as well as in some residential structures.
Asbestos has caused lung cancer and malignant mesothelioma in the children of asbestos workers.
The children were exposed to asbestos-contaminated dust brought home from work on their parents shoes and clothing.
EPA estimates that at least 1,000 premature deaths from cancer will occur in this country over the next 30 years among children who are exposed today to asbestos in schools.(14) Asbestos is harmful only when inhaled.
If an asbestos-containing product, such as a floor covering, is not disturbed enough to release microscopic particles into the air, no disease is expected to result.
Ultraviolet Light Overexposure to the suns harmful ultraviolet (UV) light may damage childrens skin.
Ultraviolet light is radiation from the sun that has a wavelength shorter than visible light (toward the violet end of the visible spectrum) but longer than that of X-rays.
This type of radiation has increased on the earths surface due to damage to the earths ozone layer in the outer atmosphere.
Excessive sunburns experienced by children 10-15 years of age increase by three fold the chance of developing malignant melanoma, the most deadly kind of skin cancer, later in life.(15,16)
Hazardous Waste Exposure to hazardous wastes that have been released into the environment may present serious health hazards to children.
Hazardous wastes include substances that have cancer or non-cancer health effects, are corrosive, or may present a danger due to fire or explosion.
They include a wide range of organic chemicals and heavy metals, as well as strong acids and bases.
Children may be exposed to such wastes when they play or live near uncontrolled hazardous waste sites or spills.
EPA estimates that 12 million people,
Page 35
Childhood Cancer
The EPA Childrens Environmental Health Yearbook
including 4 million children, live within one mile of the nations hazardous waste sites.
Many more children suffer from the toxic effects of heavy metals, such as lead, or are poisoned accidentally from improper pesticide use in their homes.(17,18)
Summary of EPA Activities Environmental Tobacco Smoke EPAs activities relating to ETS are described in Chapter 2 Asthma and Other Respiratory Effects.
Radon EPA oversees a program to detect and reduce elevated radon levels in buildings and to inform the public about radon.
Through partnerships with schools, non-profit organizations, and state agencies, EPA promotes: (1) radon awareness and testing programs for schools and homes; (2) radon-resistant building practices; (3) methods to lower radon levels; (4) training for school maintenance personnel on methods to lower radon levels; and (5) technical assistance in inspecting school buildings.
An important component of this program is the National Radon Hotline (see Chapter 11).
EPA has participated in research to identify areas of the country with high levels of radon in homes, schools, and workplaces, and to determine the national distribution of radon levels and associated risks.
EPA has supported the development of new technologies to reduce radon concentrations in existing and new buildings.
Asbestos EPA provides education and technical assistance to school districts that inspect school buildings for asbestos-containing material and control asbestos contamination.
This assistance is required by EPAs Asbestos-in-Schools Rule (1987).
EPA has a mandatory training and accreditation program for professionals who work in schools and public and commercial buildings to control asbestos.
EPA has approved 27 states to administer the Asbestos Model Accreditation Plan (MAP) Rule and directly administers a federal program in the remaining states.
This program protects children and the general public by helping ensure that buildings are inspected or cleaned up only by properly trained and accredited personnel.
EPA conducts some inspections to ensure compliance with the federal requirements for managing asbestos indoors.
EPA also ensures proper accreditation of workers.
The Agency takes enforcement actions to bring violators into compliance.
EPA also provides grants to several states and Native American Tribes for compliance monitoring activities.

Ultraviolet Light EPA offers educational programs for parents, students, and teachers about the health risks resulting from exposure to UV light, and encourages them to reduce exposure.
A new EPA program calls for participating schools to monitor the daily UV Index (a measure of exposure based on weather), undertake one or more activities to reduce sun exposure, and report their progress to EPA.
EPA also has developed a World Wide Web site that encourages teachers and students to learn about ozone depletion, UV radiation hazards, and steps to reduce UV exposure.
Hazardous Waste EPA is conducting research to determine the specific effects of hazardous substances on children.
For instance, a current EPA research project includes an approach for predicting the cancer risk from vinyl chloride gas that takes into account a childs increased sensitivity to this gas.
This state of the science approach provides a better tool for determining health risks to children.
EPA also is conducting a study of potential exposures of children to over 300 chemical compounds in a locality with an increased rate of childhood cancers over the past 21 years.
A related study addresses the health effects of arsenic as a function of age.
EPA enforcement efforts to remove or reduce childrens exposure to hazardous waste are included in Chapters 4 Developmental and Neurological Toxicity and 5 Health Effects of Pesticides.
EPA Projects Related to Cancer Radon Title: Description: Radon Mitigation for School Maintenance Personnel EPA Region 4 sponsored radon courses designed specifically to train school maintenance personnel on how to fix their own schools.
This approach, which has served 15,000 clients in three states, is much more cost effective than if the schools had to contract for the work.
Discussions are underway with Kentucky and North Carolina to offer the same opportunity.

Asbestos Title: Description: Asbestos-in-Schools Rule In response to the Asbestos Hazard Emergency Response Act, EPA published the Asbestos-in-Schools Rule (1982, updated in 1987).
The rule requires public and private elementary and secondary schools to inspect for friable (easily crumbled) and non-friable asbestos, develop management plans to address hazards, and conduct responses to eliminate the asbestos.
The EPA rule also specifies training, examination, and other requirements to accredit persons who do this work, and sets requirements for warning signs and transportation and disposal of materials containing asbestos.
EPA continues to monitor the requirements of the Asbestos-inSchools Rule and to enforce standards that protect children against
Childhood Cancer

The rule includes requirements for preschools and daycare centers to protect younger children.
EPA provides Toxic Substances Control Act funds to 26 states to carry out asbestos and other inspections.
States refer violations to the appropriate EPA regional office for enforcement.

Ultraviolet Light Title: Description: Ozone Depletion Art Project The Ozone Depletion Art Project uses the Internet to motivate students to learn about ozone depletion, UV radiation hazards, and ways to reduce sun exposure.
Using an EPA web site (www.epa.gov/ozone/art), teachers and their students learn more about ozone depletion and UV exposure precautions.
They submit drawings on the ozone layer (how it protects us from UV radiation); ozone depletion (how ozone-depleting substances harm the ozone layer); how UV radiation is measured; and how we can protect ourselves from the suns UV rays.
EPA has received more than 200 drawings so far.
EPA also responds to approximately 50 questions and comments per month from students and teachers.
Office of Air and Radiation, Jeffrey Levy, 202-564-9727 Sunwise School Program The Sunwise School Program is a school-based partnership that directly addresses health risks resulting from exposure to UV radiation.
Member schools make a commitment to: report the UV Index daily, undertake activities to reduce sun exposure, and document their activities and report their progress to EPA.
The program encourages schools to work with local meteorologists, physicians, and community groups in planning their individual Sunwise School Programs.
EPA provides schools with guidance on setting their Sunwise School Program goals, and recognizes participating schools.

children from exposure to the carcinogenic gas, vinyl chloride.
This risk assessment method has been published in the scientific literature, presented at national and international scientific meetings, nominated for an EPA scientific achievement award, and is being incorporated into the revised vinyl chloride file in IRIS (EPAs Integrated Risk Information System).
Newborn animal exposure studies have demonstrated that even a brief exposure in newborns to vinyl chloride could cause more cancers than if exposures had occurred later in life.
The risk assessment method has been used in Region 9 to set indoor air action levels protective of children exposed in their homes to landfill gas containing vinyl chloride.

For the past 21 years, it has had an increased rate of childhood cancers documented by the California Department of Health Services.
Due to the concern about childrens health, EPA is sampling and analyzing the air, soil, and water for releases of hazardous substances associated with past industrial and agricultural practices, and is investigating health problems relating to children.
Sampling is expected to be completed next year, and should allow EPA to determine the best approach to eliminating any causes that are identified through the site assessment.
Region 9, Mark Calhoon, 415-744-2376 or Elizabeth Adams, 415-744-2261 Multi-Pathway PAH Exposure Field Evaluation for Children in Low-Income Families The purpose of this research is to understand the extent to which children in low-income families are being exposed to polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs).
PAHs are a product of incomplete combustion of carbon substances (e.g., from automobile exhaust, smoke stacks, and cooking) and are fairly pervasive in the environment.
A pilot study that included both inner-city and rural homes examined the exposures of children to PAHs in air, water, food, house dust, and soil.
EPA is extend-

ing this research to include low-income children in daycare centers.
Preliminary results indicate that exposure to PAHs through inhalation, skin contact, and dirt and dust ingestion is as important a source of contamination as is dietary exposure for young children.
Future research will compare low-income and middle-income family exposures.

Developmental and Neurological Toxicity Definition Neurotoxic substances are chemical compounds that, depending on the dose, may have harmful effects on brain function and interfere with the workings of the nervous system.
Neurotoxics may affect intelligence, language ability, and attention.(1,2,3,4) They may cause behavioral problems and affect mood and social adjustment.
At very high doses, neurotoxics may produce such effects as coma, convulsions, respiratory paralysis, and death.(5) Lead, mercury, and polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) are among the substances suspected of having harmful and possibly permanent neurological effects on children.
The Mad Hatter Lewis Carrolls Mad Hatter character in Alices Adventures in Wonderland probably is based on observations of the neurotoxic effects of inhaling vapors from mercury that nineteenth century hat-makers used to prepare felt.
Abnormal development is a major concern in children because it may result in birth defects and lasting changes in intelligence, behavior, and reproductive capability.
A childs nervous system, reproductive organs, and immune system grow and develop rapidly during the first months and years of life.
As organ structures develop, vital connections between cells are established.
These delicate developmental processes in children may be easily and irreversibly disrupted by environmental toxic substances, such as lead.(6) Neurotoxics that may have only a temporary ill effect on an adult brain can cause enduring damage to a childs developing brain.(7,8) The immaturity of childrens internal systems, especially in the first few months of life, affects their ability to neutralize and rid their bodies of certain toxics.
If cells in the developing brain are destroyed by lead, mercury, or other neurotoxic chemicals, or if vital connections between nerve cells fail to form, the damage is likely to be permanent and irreversible.
This may mean a loss of intelligence and alteration of normal behavior.(9,10,11,12) Lead is a neurotoxic metal that affects areas of the brain associated with regulating behavior by altering the output of neurotransmitters and disrupting the development of nerve cells.
Lead poisoning in children may cause lowered intelligence, reading and learning disabilities, impaired hearing, reduced attention span, hyperactivity, and antisocial behavior.
Pregnant women exposed to lead may transfer the metal to a developing fetus,

Developmental and Neurological Toxicity

resulting in developmental problems.
While the fetus is developing, there are critical periods for each organ system, including the nervous system.
During these critical periods, the cells of the body are especially sensitive to environmental toxics that may interfere with the normal development of organ structure and function.
A growing body of evidence suggests a number of synthetic and naturally occurring organic chemicals may disrupt the endocrine (hormonal) systems of humans and wildlife.
A variety of chemicals cause endocrine disruption in laboratory animals, and some scientists have hypothesized that these effects also may occur in humans.
Although further research is needed before such effects can be either demonstrated or ruled out, theoretically children would be at particular risk from very low levels of endocrine disrupting chemicals because of the important role the endocrine system plays in development.
Concern exists about the potential for adverse developmental effects because chemicals that block or mimic reproductive and thyroid hormones may determine the course of prenatal development.(13,14)
Possible Environmental Factors Lead Lead is a major environmental health hazard for young children.
In 1997, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) reported that between 1991 and 1994, about 900,000 children in the United States under the age of six had elevated blood lead levels.(15,16)
Childhood Lead Facts U 900,000 American children have elevated blood lead levels of concern.(15) U Lead paint in older housing is the principal source of lead exposure to-
day.(15,16)
U Drinking water can be a significant source of lead exposure in some homes and
buildings.(15,20) U In the fetus and young children, elevated lead may damage the brain, resulting in persistent neurological dysfunction.(12)
Developmental and Neurological Toxicity
Page 46
The EPA Childrens Environmental Health Yearbook
Approximately 75 percent of U.S. homes built prior to 1978 contain some lead paint.(17,18,19) Children living in older homes are threatened by chipping or peeling lead paint, and by excessive amounts of lead-contaminated dust resulting from efforts to remove paint during remodeling.
Children may be exposed to lead through drinking water that has elevated concentrations from lead plumbing materials and corrosive water.
They may breathe air contaminated from nearby smelters, battery plants, and industrial facilities that process lead.
Exposure to lead from nearby hazardous waste sites also is a concern.(15,20)
Endocrine Disruptors Increasing scientific and public attention has been focused on substances that have the potential of disrupting the endocrine systems of wildlife, laboratory animals, and possibly humans.(21) Disruption of the endocrine system may occur in various ways.
Some chemicals may mimic a natural hormone, in effect fooling the body into over-responding to the hormone.
Other chemicals may block the effects of a hormone in parts of the body normally sensitive to it.
Still others may indirectly stimulate or inhibit the endocrine system, leading to overproduction or underproduction of hormones.
Endocrine disruptors may also play a role in reproductive cancers.(22) Scientific questions remain, however, about which chemicals are involved in disruption of the endocrine system and how children may be exposed to those chemicals.
It is not yet known whether health effects similar to those observed in laboratory animals are produced in humans, and what methods are best for testing for these effects.
EPA is investing significant resources to find answers to these questions.
PCBs and Dioxins PCBs and dioxins produce a number of toxic effects in animals.(23,24) They have been linked to such health concerns as decreased gestational age, lower birth weight, depressed immune responses, impaired mental development, and growth retardation.(24,25,26) Dioxin is considered by EPA to be a known human carcinogen and as such may have adverse effects on children that do not become apparent until many years after exposure occurs.(24,27) However, no direct causal relationship has been established between PCB exposure and human health effects.
EPA banned PCBs over 20 years ago, and the Agency has taken steps to regulate over 95 percent of known sources of dioxin in the United States.
Unfortunately, these chemicals are highly persistent in the environment.
Because PCBs accumulate in fish and in humans, additional exposures to infants and young children may occur through ingesting contaminated fish and breast milk.(22)
Page 47
Developmental and Neurological Toxicity
The EPA Childrens Environmental Health Yearbook
Mercury Mercury is another neurotoxic substance that can produce a wide range of health effects depending on the amount and timing of exposure.
Mercury is a liquid at room temperature but vaporizes readily; in vapor form it is readily absorbed through the lungs.
Repeated exposures to low levels of mercury vapor over long periods have been associated with tremors, irritability, impulsiveness, drowsiness, impaired memory, and sleep disturbances.(28) These effects may occur at lower levels of exposure in children than adults.
When mercury attaches to an organic molecule, it may be absorbed into the body through the digestive tract.
Methylmercury, which is produced naturally by certain bacteria, is such a molecule.
It can cross the placenta and enter the brain, causing severe brain damage in fetuses.
High mercury levels in fish consumed by pregnant women have been linked to severe brain damage and cerebral palsy in newborns.(28,29) Children are exposed to mercury primarily from eating contaminated fish.
However, children eating soil contaminated with mercury or accidental exposures to mercury, also have been documented.
Manganese Airborne manganese particles emitted from industrial and natural sources or from a fuel additive (methylcyclopentadienyl manganese tricarbonyl or MMT) may be neurotoxic.
Although MMT was banned by EPA as a gasoline additive in 1994, a recent court ruling allowed the additive to be used while being tested for health effects.
Laboratory studies show that manganese disturbs normal functioning of brain cells in rats.
Manganese compounds also cross the placenta and may retard growth in fetal rodents.
Evidence of developmental effects from chronic inhalation of manganese compounds in humans comes from manganese miners, who have high rates of psychosis and frequently suffer from a condition similar to Parkinsons disease.(30,31)
Summary of EPA Activities Lead EPAs phase out of lead in gasoline, beginning in 1976, has resulted in a major reduction in airborne lead levels.
Between 1976 and 1995, ambient air lead concentrations in the United States have declined on average by 97 percent.(32) Several measures have substantially reduced lead exposure from drinking water.
The Safe Drinking Water Act prohibits use or sale of lead solder and the manufacture of water coolers containing lead components.
Plumbing manufacturers have phased down the

amount of lead in faucets and other fixtures.
Water suppliers are required by EPA regulation to minimize the corrosiveness of their water and replace, where needed, lead service connections.
Lead in the diet has been reduced dramatically because crops are much less likely to be contaminated by lead in the air and because of the phase out of lead solder in food cans.
The combination of all of these actions has helped reduce average blood lead levels in children and adults by more than 80 percent since the 1970s, according to CDC data, protecting millions of children from serious, permanent neurological effects.(16) Because of the continuing threat of exposure from lead paint, EPA works with the Departments of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) and Health and Human Services (HHS) to ensure that the nations housing is safe from lead contamination.
HUD and EPA are responsible for enforcement of the Residential Disclosure Rule that gives consumers the right to know about lead-based paint hazards in pre-1978 homes that they may buy or rent.
This rule requires, among other things: Disclosure of all known lead-based paint hazards in pre-1978 housing and any available reports on lead in the housing.
Distribution of the EPA pamphlet Protect Your Family from Lead in Your Home.
Inclusion of warnings in sales or lease contracts.
An opportunity to test the housing for lead.
EPA also is working with the states to help ensure that abatement (control or removal) of lead-based paint hazards is carried out safely.
The Agency has established rules regulating the training of individuals conducting lead-based paint abatement, accreditation of training programs, and certification of contractors.
A comprehensive assessment of residential lead risks to children is being developed by the Agency.
This assessment will include a process for identifying specific levels of lead contamination in residential dust and soil as well as paint conditions that present hazards to children.
EPA is taking legal action at nonferrous metal smelters that violate state or federal regulations.
Through increased enforcement, EPA is reducing lead emissions that may contaminate schools and lawns where children play.
The Agency also is researching childhood blood lead levels in communities surrounding former lead smelters and paying close attention to ongoing studies in this area.
EPA, the Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry (ATSDR), and HUD are working together to examine blood lead levels in children and to develop ways to deal with the effects of environmental lead on children in urban environments.
This work

includes examining the dietary intake of lead in young children and investigating the effects of lead on adolescent development and maturation.
The Agency conducts a variety of public education programs aimed at the children most at risk from lead poisoning, particularly disadvantaged children who live in houses contaminated with lead paint.
For example: A number of EPA regions are training volunteers to educate residents in low-income areas about how to recognize and prevent childhood lead poisoning in their communities.
In Region 7, community outreach focuses on protecting children from lead poisoning in residential settings and in mining communities, where blood lead studies revealed unsafe lead levels in children.
Other regions offer programs to protect tribal groups and migrant workers from lead contamination in soils.
Scientists Study New Methods for Assessing Lead Exposure among Children EPA is expanding its efforts to evaluate the impact on children from lead-contaminated hazardous waste sites.
A new Integrated Exposure and Uptake Biokinetics (IEUBK) model was designed to be used in predicting the risks to children posed by sites with lead contamination.
This method allows researchers to evaluate the risk of lead poisoning to children between the ages of six months and six years for the first time.
It predicts changes in blood lead levels based on exposure through soil ingestion and inhalation, allowing EPA to better evaluate the need for cleanup at the site.
Endocrine Disruptors EPA has developed a substantial research program to understand the adverse effects of endocrine disrupting chemicals that exist in the environment.
Under the mandates of the Safe Drinking Water Act and the Food Quality Protection Act, EPA established the Endocrine Disruptor Screening and Testing Advisory Committee to advise the Agency on a screening and testing strategy for potential endocrine disruptors.
EPA has issued new guidelines for evaluating reproductive toxicity and is updating guidelines for reproductive and developmental toxicity testing.
Region 5 sponsored a workshop to discuss science and public policy issues related to endocrine disruptors in the Great Lakes Basin.

EPA is devoting significant resources to implement a multi-year research strategy on endocrine disruptors.
Agency personnel participate in a workgroup (convened by the Presidents Office of Science and Technology Policy) charged with coordinating research on endocrine disruptors throughout the federal government.
The Agency is funding the National Research Councils detailed review of existing literature on endocrine disruption.
EPA has prepared its own review of the literature and has issued an interim policy statement while it awaits the NRC report.(22) EPA also is sponsoring research on the reproductive effects of certain pesticides, the relationship between human sperm count and fertility, and reproductive problems among alligators and fish resulting from chemical contamination.
PCBs and Dioxins EPA is conducting research to better understand the potential neurological and developmental effects of PCBs and dioxins.
EPA is assessing the neurotoxic risks to children exposed to PCBs, and is further examining the long-term effects of PCB exposure.
Mercury EPA has recently completed a Report to Congress on mercury that assesses the magnitude of U.S. mercury emissions, the health and environmental implications, and control technologies.
(33) EPA is conducting studies that focus on specific risks to children from mercury, and is monitoring the findings of human studies on methylmercury exposure and its impact on nervous system development.
The Agency will continue its work on setting standards for allowable levels of exposure to mercury.
EPA also has begun a public education program to increase awareness and prevent mercury poisoning in children exposed to mercury vapors in homes.

Lead Poisoning Prevention and Lead Hazard Awareness Public Education and Outreach Grant Program In 1997, EPA announced a new lead poisoning prevention and lead hazard awareness public education and outreach grant program.
The purpose of the program is to increase lead-based paint hazard awareness and promote lead-poisoning prevention to high-risk target audiences.
EPA is particularly interested in supporting projects conducted by smaller organizations, such as local governments, community groups, and other specialized non-governmental organizations operating on the local level.
Office of Prevention, Pesticides, and Toxic Substances, Megan Carroll, 202-260-7269 Lead-Based Paint Maintenance Training Program EPA and the HUD have developed a lead-safe training program for building maintenance staff.
The training is designed to educate workers and their supervisors at multi-unit rental properties on techniques to use during routine maintenance to prevent lead hazards in the buildings they maintain.
Office of Prevention, Pesticides, and Toxic Substances, Jack Primack, 202-260-3407 Renovation and Remodeling Study Phases 1 and 2 EPA is conducting a renovation and remodeling study to characterize the lead levels associated with selected renovation and remodeling activities and the blood lead levels from a survey of workers who typically engage in renovation and remodeling.
Office of Prevention, Pesticides, and Toxic Substances, Darlene Watford, 202-260-3989 Laboratory Study of Lead Cleaning Products EPA conducted a laboratory study of cleaning products.

on the study, EPA now recommends cleaning with an all-purpose cleaner or cleaner made specifically for lead.
This recommendation is for cleaning after a lead-based paint abatement and for regular household cleaning.
One conclusion was that the amount of effort involved in cleaning probably is more important than the choice of cleaning product.
Contact: Office of Prevention, Pesticides, and Toxic Substances, Ben Lim, 202260-1509 Renovation and Remodeling Study Phase 3 EPA is working with the University of Wisconsin to study the relationship between the incidence of renovation and remodeling activities and childrens blood lead levels.
Data has been collected from approximately 3,600 households.
Participants were administered an extensive questionnaire by telephone.
The primary goal is to determine if there is an association between elevated blood lead levels in children and renovation and remodeling activities in the home.
A secondary goal is to examine the relationship between behavioral characteristics and blood lead levels.
University of Wisconsin Office of Prevention, Pesticides, and Toxic Substances, Dan Reinhart, 202-260-1585 Guidance for Testing Lead Products The goal of this project is to develop guidelines and performance characteristics for the testing of lead hazard identification and lead hazard control products by third party organizations.
A number of meetings with affected stakeholders are planned to gather information on how a third party testing program would work.
In the past, EPA has tested lead-related products by itself.

Repair and Maintenance Study This study examined the effect of different levels of lead-based paint interventions on dust and childrens blood lead levels.
The study includes three intervention groups, a control group of homes built after 1978, and a group of homes previously abated.
The three intervention groups applied a series of control measures that cost about $1,500 per home for the least intensive intervention, about $3,000 per home for the next level of intervention, and $6,000-7,000 per home for the most expensive intervention.
Reports on the outcome will be published in 1998.
Kennedy Krieger Research Institute Office of Prevention, Pesticides, and Toxic Substances, Ben Lim, 202260-1509 Milwaukee Low-Cost Intervention Studies In cooperation with the Milwaukee Health Department, EPA is assessing the effectiveness of in-home visits by trained representatives of the Health Department and of low-cost abatement methods.
The in-home visits cover hygiene, nutrition, cleaning, and reducing lead exposure, and they cost approximately $100 per visit.
The abatement methods include paint stabilization and window treatments.
City of Milwaukee Health Department and University of Wisconsin Office of Prevention, Pesticides, and Toxic Substances, Brad Schultz, 202-260-3896 National Lead Laboratory Accreditation Program (NLLAP) The NLLAP provides a list of laboratories recognized by EPA as being proficient for analysis of lead in paint, dust, and soil.
Two additions to the NLLAP are planned.
First, the proficiency testing part of NLLAP will be changed to a double-blind system that more closely represents typical laboratory performance.
Second, the NLLAP will be expanded to include field-portable technologies commonly used to test for lead in paint, dust, and soil.

Health Effects of Pesticides Definition A pesticide is any substance intended to destroy, prevent, or repel pests, such as insects, weeds, fungi, and rodents.
The term pesticide includes numerous types of substances designed for different purposes.
For instance, herbicides kill unwanted plants, fungicides kill fungi, rodenticides kill rodents, and disinfectants kill microorganisms.
Although many pesticides are synthesized from petroleum, some are derived from natural origins.
Childhood Pesticide Facts U Children develop leukemia three to nine times more often when pesticides are
used around their homes.(1,2) U Brain tumors and other cancers in children have been linked with exposures to insecticides.(3,4,5) U EPA estimated that as much as 75 percent of household pesticide use is inside
the home and 22 percent is in yards and gardens.(6)
Pesticides are used widely in the United States, but not without some risk.
Depending on the dose, pesticides may cause a range of harmful health effects and may accumulate in ecosystems.
Among the health effects reported are cancer, acute and chronic injury to the nervous system, lung damage, reproductive dysfunction, and possibly dysfunction of the endocrine (hormone) and immune systems.(7,8) Children are at greater risk of pesticide exposure than most adults.
Pound for pound of body weight, children not only breathe more, eat more, and have a more rapid metabolism than adults, but also they play on the floor and lawn where pesticides are commonly applied.
Children have more frequent hand-to-mouth contact as well.
Children may be exposed to pesticides in their diets, drinking water, and during activities at home, play, and school.
Children may be exposed more heavily to certain pesticides because they consume a diet different than adults.
For instance, children typically consume larger quantities of milk, applesauce, and orange juice per pound of body weight.
This means their exposure to any pesticide residues in these foods may be higher than that of adults.
Children generally are more susceptible than adults to environmental toxics because they are growing and developing.
Also, their enzymatic, metabolic, and immune systems are immature, allowing in some cases for less natural protection than that of adults.(9,10)

Health Effects of Pesticides
The EPA Childrens Environmental Health Yearbook
Several hundred active ingredients, representing thousands of pesticide products, are registered with the EPA.(10) Some may cause massive acute poisoning if used improperly.
Others have no obvious immediate effects, but may lead to cancer, nervous system injury, or immune system damage years or decades after exposure.(10)
Potential Health Effects from Pesticide Exposure The organophosphate and carbamate insecticides are commonly-used pesticides and are, therefore, a concern for children.
Organophosphate insecticides work by disrupting the nervous system of insects.
Unfortunately, they have a similar effect on people, pets, and wildlife.
Exposure to organophosphates inhibits an important enzyme (acetylcholinesterase) found at many nerve endings.
Inhibiting this cholinesterase enzyme can cause excessive nerve stimulation.
Pinpoint pupils, nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, diarrhea, profuse sweating, and muscle twitching are common symptoms after exposures to high doses of organophosphate pesticides.
Respiratory paralysis and death may occur in severe cases.
Repeated exposures may damage the nervous system.
Carbamate insecticides are very similar to the organophosphates, but the acute effects are usually reversible.(8,11) For this reason, carbamate insecticides often are used instead of organophosphates.
Delayed adverse effects to the nervous system have not been documented with the newer carbamate chemicals.
In recent years, scientists have become concerned that certain chemicals, including a few pesticides, might be disrupting the endocrine systems of humans and wildlife.
Scientists also have proposed that endocrine disruption might result in cancer and harm to the reproductive system and thyroid glands.(8,12) EPA activities related to endocrine disruptors are described in Chapter 4 Developmental and Neurological Effects.
Pesticides may present a threat to the health of children because of their wide-spread use, high toxicity, and possible misuse by uninformed, inexperienced homeowners and professionals.
Some active ingredients in pesticides have been shown to cause birth defects, cancer, and thyroid disease in rats and mice.
Supposedly inert ingredients in any pesticide product may include solvents, diesel fuel, or other petroleum products that also may be toxic to exposed children.(9,10,11)
Possible Environmental Factors Dietary Exposures Infants and children may be exposed to trace amounts of pesticides in food and in breast milk.
EPA regulates trace amounts of pesticides, termed residues, in food through a
Health Effects of Pesticides
Page 84
The EPA Childrens Environmental Health Yearbook
system of standards called food tolerances.
A tolerance is a legal limit on the amount of pesticide in a particular food.
In the past, the amount of pesticide predicted to be consumed was based on the behavior and diet of an average adult American rather than on the special susceptibility, diet, and behavior of children.(10,11) For over a decade, however, assessments of pesticide residues in the diet has included other age groups, including children under one year of age and one to six years of age.
Also in the past, EPA considered the effects of each pesticide in isolation rather than recognizing that people, and especially children, often are exposed to many pesticide residues at the same time.
This practice has changed in light of the requirements of the 1996 Food Quality Protection Act.
Certain agricultural chemicals, particularly herbicides, have been detected in ground water in some areas of the country.(13,14) As a result, children and others may be exposed to pesticides through their drinking water.
Although insecticide use in the United States has decreased in recent years, herbicide use has increased dramatically.
Certain herbicides have been associated with cancer, particularly soft tissue sarcoma and non-Hodgkins lymphoma in animal studies.
Fungicides also may be toxic, and some have been linked to cancer.(15) They are used extensively on fruits and vegetables, many of which are eaten in larger quantities by children than adults.
Each year children accidentally ingest pesticides as a result of careless storage or handling.
EPA receives an average of 24,000 pesticide hotline calls each year, two-thirds of which are from parents concerned about pesticide risks to their children.
Dermal and Airborne Exposures Pesticides are used extensively in homes, apartments, schools, daycare centers, and public buildings to control cockroaches and other pests.
In the home, flea bombs, insecticide sprays, and foggers are the primary sources of exposure to children.
The pesticide chlordane, banned by the EPA for termite control because of its cancer-causing potential, was used for many years in basements and around foundations of homes and other buildings.
Because it persists in the environment for decades, children may remain at risk in areas where this pesticide was used.(16,17) Lawn-care pesticides also are a major source of childhood exposure.
Children not only contact these pesticides while playing outside, but also track them inside.
Children living on or near farms or pesticide manufacturing facilities may be exposed to pesticides in the air.
Children also may be exposed to pesticides through contaminated shoes and clothing if their parents work in agriculture or with pesticides.
Occupational and household pesticide exposures of parents have been associated with increased risks for acute nonlymphoblastic leukemia in their children.(1)
Page 85

Finally, children may come into contact with pesticide residues from pest treatment of school buildings and classrooms.
Because of health concerns and costs, schools are trying to reduce pesticide use through new pest-control methods.
The use of integrated pest management strategies, encouraged by EPA, offer alternatives to and reduction in chemical pesticide use.
Summary of EPA Activities A 1993 National Academy of Sciences report Pesticides in the Diets of Infants and Children concluded that the scientific and regulatory approaches in effect at that time did not adequately protect infants and children from pesticide residues in food.(9) The Academy called on EPA to make significant changes: to identify pesticide exposures, analyze the potential for harmful health effects, and use these data to determine actual risks.
The Academy report provided a major challenge to EPA to improve the safety of the food supply and provide greater assurance that children are protected.
EPA Administrator Carol Browner responded to the Academy report with the announcement of a national policy to consistently and explicitly take into account health risks to children and infants from environmental hazards when assessing environmental risks.
In 1996, Congress passed the Food Quality Protection Act (FQPA) to provide further protection to children (See box on following page).
EPA is committed to ensuring the safety of the foods children eat by: (1) reducing the use of high-risk pesticides, (2) increasing the research and testing needed to learn more about childrens exposure to pesticides in food, (3) working with the states to assure compliance with existing pesticide laws and regulations, and (4) establishing new standards to protect children and infants from dietary exposures to pesticides.
EPA also is expanding its study of the effects of pesticides on the neurological, endocrine, and immune systems of children.
Strengthened Standards and Better Public Information The Safe Drinking Water Act Amendments (SDWA) of 1996 and FQPA include measures to protect the public from harmful contaminants in water and food.
Both Acts provide for special consideration of the risks to susceptible members of the population, such as children.
The special protections in FQPA require EPA to characterize the potential hazards and exposure to infants and children from pesticides in their food.
An extra ten-fold margin of safety must be used to account for uncertainties regarding available information on how dangerous a chemical is and how much exposure is likely, unless data exist to show that such an extra margin of safety is not necessary.
EPA must reassess approximately 10,000 existing pesticide tolerances by August 2006.
The Agency will address first those pesticides that pose the greatest hazards.
Health Effects of Pesticides
Page 86
The EPA Childrens Environmental Health Yearbook
FQPA Reforms on Pesticides U Strengthen health-based standards to limit risks of pesticide exposure to children.
U Require an additional safety factor in setting standards to protect the health of unborns
and newborns.
U Require consideration of all sources of pesticide exposure, such as diet and drinking water, and the cumulative effects of pesticide residues when determining health risks to children.
U Expand consumers right-to-know about pesticide risks to children.
To reduce the use of the most dangerous pesticides, EPA is working with other government agencies on integrated pest management techniques.
The purpose of this program is to ensure the availability of cost-effective alternatives for agricultural growers, utilities, and other groups.
Toward this end, EPA is hastening the movement of safer pesticides onto the market.
EPA assesses the dietary risk to infants and children when registering and re-registering uses of pesticides on foods.
The Agency is developing better methods to assess pesticide exposures.
EPA also is working with the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) and the Department of Agriculture (USDA) to design new surveys to improve knowledge of what infants and children eat.
The USDA, in partnership with several state laboratories, conducts an annual survey of residues of pesticides in foods (the Pesticide Data Program, or PDP).
The foods that are sampled are those most often eaten by children.
The sampled pesticides are those commonly used on the foods eaten by children.
EPA, USDA, and the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) are working with the National Food Processors Association and other private sector groups to develop a National Pesticide Residue Database.
This database will contain PDP and other residue data EPA will use to develop more accurate estimates of pesticide residues in food.
EPA is developing methods for estimating pesticide exposures and risks from multiple sources, such as food, drinking water, and household pesticides.
The Agency also has developed a new method for assessing acute exposures to pesticides.
A new Consumer Labeling Initiative will expand the amount of hazard and health information on pesticide labels, similar to the new food nutrition labels.
EPA is working with the Consumer Product Safety Commission, FDA, key industry groups, parents,and health

professionals to implement this program.
EPA also provides numerous publications and publicservice announcements to increase public awareness of the dangers to children from careless handling and other misuses of pesticides.
Support for Integrated Pest Management Pesticides are useful to society because of their ability to kill disease-causing organisms and control insects, weeds, and other pests.
However, they need to be managed to protect people and the environment.
EPA, which has the lead responsibility for regulating pesticides in the United States, supports an integrated pest management (IPM) approach.
The overall goals of IPM are to minimize pesticide use, choose those pesticides that are least toxic to people and the environment, and increase the use of non-chemical approaches, such as good housekeeping and preventive maintenance.
IPM has been successfully adopted by many school districts across the country.
Expanded Enforcement Efforts EPA and state pesticide agencies cooperate to ensure that pesticide users, manufacturers, producers, dealers, and the rest of the regulated community follow the pesticide laws and regulations.
This cooperation includes issuing enforcement actions in response to violations, some of which may endanger children.
For instance, EPA and several state agencies are responding to a series of incidents in urban and other residential communities involving illegal application of methyl parathion.
Methyl parathion is approved only for use outdoors as an agricultural pesticide, but was used illegally in homes and businesses mainly to control cockroaches.
The Urban and Residential Pesticide Control and Enforcement Program provides guidance to state agencies to help identify, halt, and prevent the illegal use of pesticides indoors.
The program also attempts to facilitate cooperation between state enforcement agencies, public health officials, and other local organizations.
Understanding Risks to Childrens Health EPA will require pesticide and chemical manufacturers to conduct new tests to assess potential toxic effects of pesticides on reproduction and development and on the immune and nervous systems.
EPA has proposed updated guidelines for assessing the risks of cancer causing substances.
It also recently issued guidelines for assessing potential neurotoxic effects in humans, including children.
EPA is expanding its research program on pesticides in children.
Scientists are surveying childrens exposures to pesticides through air, water, food, and house dust in schools, daycare facilities, and other places children may encounter pesticides.
Researchers are

studying childrens activity patterns and examining how the health effects of pesticides differ for children and adults.
They are especially interested in how pesticide effects differ at critical periods of neurological and immunological development.
EPA Projects on Health Effects of Pesticides Strengthened Standards and Better Public Information Title: Description: Pesticide Re-Registration Program Through the re-registration program, EPA is reviewing human health and environmental effects data and making re-registration eligibility decisions on all active pesticide ingredients registered before November 1, 1984.
All registered pesticides must meet the new safety standards of the 1996 Food Quality Protection Act.
Under this law, EPA must conclude with reasonable certainty that no harm will come to infants and children or any other individuals exposed to pesticides.
Pesticide exposure from food, drinking water, home, garden, and all other sources must be considered in determining allowable levels of pesticides in food.
As a result of this law, all pesticide tolerances are being reassessed as part of the re-registration program.
Office of Prevention, Pesticides, and Toxic Substances, Carol Stangel, 703-308-8007 Pesticides: Food Safety EPA Region 5 frequently provides information to the public regarding pesticide residues in food.
This includes general information on why pesticides are needed, ways to reduce the residue remaining on fresh fruits and vegetables, pesticide-specific data, and specific food tolerances.

Potential Risks from Contaminated Water Potential Waterborne Risks Childrens exposure to waterborne contaminants can occur when eating contaminated fish, consuming contaminated drinking water, or swimming in contaminated oceans, lakes, or streams.
Disease-causing organisms in sewage-contaminated water can result in hepatitis, dysentery, gastrointestinal illness, fever, ear infections, and other health problems.
Also bodies of water and their sediments can be contaminated with toxic substances, such as polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) and metals like arsenic, mercury, lead, and chromium.
These contaminants are thought to contribute to serious health problems, such as cancer, birth defects, nervous system damage, respiratory system disease, burns, and skin irritations.(1,2,3,4,5) Hundreds of beaches are closed each summer because of contamination from untreated sewage and other sources.
In 1995, more than 3,500 beaches in the United States posted warning signs or closed for at least one day due to bacteriological or other types of contamination.
The most frequent sources of harmful microbes are fecal contamination from sewer overflows, water treatment plant malfunctions, and storm water runoff.
Surface waters and their sediments also can be contaminated by toxic chemicals, such as PCBs and heavy metals.(6) Children and women of childbearing age may be at increased risk compared to other subpopulations.
Compared to adults, children are at increased risk to bacterial and viral infections because they play in the water for longer periods, tend to have more cuts and scrapes, and may accidentally swallow more water than adults.
Women exposed to high levels of PCBs or mercury during pregnancy may give birth to children with delayed development and learning disabilities.
Fish are an important part of a healthy diet.
However, some fish caught for sport or subsistence may contain chemicals that could pose health risks if eaten too often.
Pollutants, such as PCBs and mercury that accumulate (or bioaccumulate) in increasing amounts in the tissues of fish, birds, animals, and humans, are of great concern because of the potential for high exposures.
Eating fish containing certain chemical pollutants may cause birth defects, liver damage, cancer, and other serious health problems.
These pollutants may pose special risks to a developing fetus, nursing infant, and young child when they or their mothers eat contaminated fish.(7) Tap water that meets federal and state standards generally is safe to drink.
However, some contaminants of potential concern are not currently regulated.
Threats to drinking water quality and quantity are increasing.
These emerging problems need attention and are the object of extensive federal, state, and local efforts.
Page 105
Potential Risks from Contaminated Water
The EPA Childrens Environmental Health Yearbook
All drinking water contains some naturally occurring chemical contaminants, which are usually not harmful at low levels.
Actual events of serious drinking water contamination are infrequent, and typically are not at levels posing acute health concerns.
In 1994, only eight percent of community drinking water systems reported a violation of the total coliform (bacteria) standard in drinking water.(8) Generally, these standards are established based on a lifetime of exposure, therefore, one violation poses a limited health risk.
When microbiological and chemical contaminants enter water supplies, their potential effects include gastrointestinal illness, skin irritations, cancer, reproductive and developmental problems, and other health effects.
Microbiological contaminants are of greater concern because they may cause immediate health threats, such as gastrointestinal illness.(9, 10) Frequently occurring microbial contaminants include the Norwalk virus, Cryptosporidium, and Giardia.
The effects of contaminated drinking water are illustrated by localized outbreaks of waterborne disease.
Most of these outbreaks have been linked to contamination by bacteria, protozoa, or viruses, probably from human or animal waste.
For example, in 1993 and 1994, there were 30 reported disease outbreaks associated with drinking water: 23 associated with public drinking water supplies; and seven with private wells.(9, 10) In 1993, the water treatment plant in Milwaukee became ineffective during a period of heavy rainfall and storm water runoff, and hundreds of thousands of Milwaukee residents became ill from drinking water contaminated by the microbe Cryptosporidium.
Over 4,000 persons were hospitalized, and over 50 died (some counts put deaths as high as 100).(11) Children may be more vulnerable to certain waterborne contaminants.
Because children, especially infants, drink more fluids per pound of body weight than adults, they could be more exposed to contaminants present in drinking water.
Since the immune systems of very young children are not as well developed as those of adults, they may be less able than healthy adults to fight microbes in drinking water, and children have more severe effects from gastrointestinal infections.
While growing, children may be susceptible to contaminants that affect the critical stages of development.
Nitrates, which are occasionally found in drinking water at concentrations above the national standard, can pose a serious threat to very young children, especially newborns.
Commonly used in fertilizer and as curing agents in foods, nitrates can be converted to nitrites in the intestines of children.
After entering the blood stream, nitrites block the oxygen carrying capacity of the blood, resulting in anemia or blue-baby disease.
While rare, this condition can be particularly severe in infants who consume nitrate-rich water in their milk formula.
An enzyme that reverses the effect of nitrites in older children and adults is not fully functional in infants.(12)

Summary of EPA Activities EPA is protecting children from risks associated with water pollution in drinking water, surface water, and fish.
EPA issues national standards and health advisories; oversees the monitoring of drinking water supplies; and supports state programs that help ensure safe beaches, clean surface water, and uncontaminated fish.
EPA takes enforcement actions where there are violations of drinking water standards or wastewater discharge permits, or where a discharge is not permitted.
Contaminants in Drinking Water EPA is engaged in a number of activities to characterize better the occurrence, exposure, and health impacts of drinking water contaminants on a number of particularly vulnerable populations (sensitive subpopulations), including infants and young children.
These activities result in better health assessments, regulations, and enforcement with respect to drinking water protections.
Examples of these activities include general improvements in risk assessments that cut across all areas of the drinking water program: Health assessment methods: Maximum Contaminant Levels (MCLs) for drinking water are written with the goal of protecting the most sensitive subpopulations from contaminant exposure.
Therefore, regardless of whether children are found to be the most sensitive subpopulation to exposure to a particular contaminant, their health is protected.
General health research: The Safe Drinking Water Act of 1996 calls for better science and analysis of health effects to sensitive subpopulations, including children, to support the development of drinking water regulations.
Extensive research to better characterize risk is underway and focuses on the health effects of chemical and microbial contaminants.
Risk-based contaminant selection: New tools are being developed to help ensure that contaminants posing the greatest threat to public health are the first to be considered for regulation.
(Determinations of greater public health risk are based on the most sensitive subpopulation.)
For example, a National Contaminant Occurrence database is being developed that will store information on occurrence of drinking water contaminants and potential contaminants.
This database will be used to support EPAs decisions on which contaminants to regulate in the future.
In the past, EPA has focused its drinking water regulatory activities in three areas: gastrointestinal diseases resulting from exposure to waterborne microbes, cancer, and lower intelligence quotients (IQ) in children exposed to lead in drinking water.
The Surface Water Treatment Rule and the Total Coliform Rule help prevent gastrointestinal diseases
Page 107

by controlling microbial pathogens in drinking water.
Future regulations will target high priority chemical contaminants.
Also, EPA is examining the health risk trade-off between controlling microbial pathogens, including Cryptosporidium, and increased risk of cancer resulting from potentially cancer causing byproducts that are formed when water disinfectants come in contact with organic matter present in water.
The Safe Drinking Water Act controls childrens exposure to lead via drinking water by requiring regulated public water supplies to treat their water to reduce the waters capacity to corrode lead materials in plumbing and distribution systems.(13) Also, there are national standards for lead in various plumbing materials, houses, and the connections between the public water main and buildings where people receive their water.
Lead service lines can no longer be installed, and those still in place must be tested and replaced if tap water exceeds the drinking water action level.
Other lead materials, particularly lead solder, have been banned from use in water systems.
Faucets must undergo performance testing to demonstrate that they do not contribute excessive concentrations of lead to the drinking water.
The requirements of the Lead and Copper Rule have resulted in a significant reduction in the exposure of children to excessive lead in drinking water.(8)
Contaminants in Surface Water EPAs efforts to protect people from surface water contamination center around the Clean Water Act.
Under the Act, any point-source discharge to a water of the United States is prohibited unless authorized by a permit.
Through the permit process, EPA and the states control chemical and other discharges to surface waters.
Facilities must operate, monitor, and report in compliance with their permits.
EPA or delegated states enforce the provisions of the permit when violations of the limits occur.
The Beach Health Protection Program works with local officials and groups to inform the public about contamination at beaches and thus reduce childrens exposure.
EPA has begun to collect beach monitoring and closure information and make it available to the public.
This information will be compiled in a database and included on a World Wide Web site on beach health.
EPA takes legal action against municipal wastewater systems by requiring that they upgrade to eliminate or reduce overflows and malfunctions, which are major contributors to beach contamination.
The Agency also is working with other federal agencies and the states to protect infants from exposure to toxic molds resulting from floods.
Contaminated Fish EPA and state and tribal health departments are improving the effectiveness of fish consumption advisories and thus are reducing health risks to children who eat fish and to the fetuses of pregnant women who eat fish.
EPA is developing new ways to determine health
Potential Risks from Contaminated Water

risks and to assess how much fish children and women of childbearing age eat.
In conjunction with the Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry (ATSDR), EPA is developing materials that explain the health risks developing fetuses and children may encounter when their mothers consume contaminated fish.
These materials are intended for pediatricians; state, tribal, and local health agencies; and the public.
Through its regional initiatives program, EPA is working with a number of states, tribes, and Canada to reduce contamination and eliminate future pollution in the Great Lakes.
Projects on Contaminants in Water and Fish Contaminants in Water Title: Description: Microbial Disinfectant/Disinfection Byproducts (M-DBP) Rules: A new set of rules currently is being developed to address the risk tradeoff between controlling microbial pathogens, including Cryptosporidium, and potentially cancer causing byproducts formed when disinfectants come into contact with organic matter present in water.
These rules are collectively known as the Microbial-Disinfectant/Disinfection Byproducts (M-DBP) Rules.
The first of these, the Interim Enhanced Surface Water Treatment Rule and the Stage 1 Disinfectant/Disinfection Byproducts Rule (D/DBPR), are due to be completed in November 1998.
Other rules in the M-DBP cluster are the Information Collection Rule, the Final Enhanced Surface Water Treatment Rule, and the Stage 2 D/DBPR.
These standards will be set based on the most sensitive subpopulations affected by the contaminants.
Children are among those sensitive subpopulations considered, and therefore will be protected by these regulations.
Office of Water, Elizabeth Corr, 202-260-8907 Information Collection: Sensitive Subpopulations The 1996 amendments to the Safe Drinking Water Act charge EPA to identify subpopulations (e.g., infants, children, pregnant women) at greater risk than the general public to adverse health effects from exposure to contaminants in drinking water.
The contaminants of interest for the Interim Enhanced Surface Water Treatment Rule are microorganisms (specifically Cryptosporidium, Giardia, and intestinal viruses) that are a potential hazard to human health.
In addition, EPA has begun to collect data on individuals whose immune systems are potentially suppressed

Contact: Title: Description: Office of Water, Joyce M. Donohue, 202-260-1318 Microbial Diseases: Effects of Age and Sex on Morbidity and Mortality In the regulation of disinfectants and their byproducts, there is a delicate balance between the risk associated with chemical exposure and the risk associated with exposure to waterborne pathogens.
The relative risks are affected by a number of factors, including the impact of age and sex on sensitivity to microbial diseases.
EPA proposes to use CDC data on morbidity and mortality from outbreaks of microbial foodborne and waterborne diseases, to evaluate the influence of age and sex on susceptibility to microbial diseases and disease mortality.
Differences in apparent response for different microorganisms will be evaluated where possible.
The CDC data will be supplemented by published accounts of the disease outbreaks.
This study will allow EPA to document the susceptibility of children to microbial diseases and make better risk-management decisions based on improved data.
Office of Water, Joyce M. Donohue, 202-260-1318 Water Consumption Estimates for Subpopulations, Including Children This study will examine whether and to what extent infants, children, pregnant women, the elderly, individuals with a history of serious illness, or other subpopulations may experience elevated health risks from contaminants in drinking water.
Current drinking water intake rates for primary sources of water are based on data now 20 years old, and there is reason to believe that water consumption patterns have changed since that time.
To characterize current exposure to contaminants in drinking water, EPA will generate estimates of tap and bottled water intake based on the U.S. Department of Agricultures 1994, 1995, and 1996 Continuing Survey of Food Intake by Individuals (CSFII).
Estimates will be generated based

These regulations established monitoring and treatment requirements for public water systems.
This project is designed to ensure compliance by all public water systems, thereby reducing the amount of lead children consume from drinking water.
So far, several hundred enforcement actions have been taken by EPA and the states against systems that have failed to meet the initial monitoring requirements of the rule.
Currently, EPA is evaluating data on whether systems have complied with the subsequent requirements in the rule (e.g., installation of corrosion control, beginning of lead service replacement).
EPA will be working with the states to take appropriate actions to return violators to compliance.

The program will provide effective communication to Baltimore residents about the fish consumption advisories in the harbor, best methods for preparing and cooking fish to reduce exposure to contaminated fish tissue, and the risks from eating fish caught in the harbor.
Region 3, Reggie Harris, 215-566-2988 Fish Advisories in Region 2 EPA has been involved in public communication of fish advisories in the states of New York and New Jersey.
The health advisories are targeted to particular populations at risk, including anglers who eat their catch, pregnant and nursing women, and children.
Communication takes the form of flyers (some translated into other languages); public service announcements; and working with local health care providers, particularly pre-and neonatal clinics.
The bodies of water most involved are the Hudson River, New York/New Jersey Harbor, Passaic River, Niagara River, and the Great Lakes.

The first phase, which was completed by the Columbia River Intertribal Fish Commission, documented the types and amounts of fish eaten by tribal members.
It showed that tribal children ate an average of 19.6 grams of fish per day, three times the national average of 6.5 grams.
This finding is important since several studies have shown that plants and animals in the Columbia River Basin have elevated levels of harmful contaminants.
Phase II of the study consists of sampling and analysis of fish species that are eaten by tribal members.
Information from both phases will be used to assess the potential health impacts to children from consuming contaminants in the river.

Technical Assistance on Risk from Consumption of Contaminated Fish EPAs Fish Contamination Program (FCP) provides technical assistance to states and tribes in characterizing health risk associated with exposure to chemical contaminants in noncommercial fish and wildlife.
In cooperation with the states, tribes, and other federal agencies, the FCP has developed a four-volume set of guidance documents entitled Guidance for Assessing Chemical Contaminant Data for Use in Fish Advisories.
This guidance includes recommended methods for protecting children and women of childbearing age from consuming fish with harmful levels of contaminants.
The guidance has been distributed nationally and is used by the majority of states for issuing fish advisories, and is periodically updated to reflect new information.

Predicting Health Risks to Children EPA Assesses Risk to Protect Children and Their Environment To protect human health and the environment, EPA estimates the severity of environmental risks that could influence human populations and the environment.
Risk assessment is the process of identifying and estimating the level of risk.
Risk assessment is a complex, analytical process involving expertise in various disciplines, such as chemistry, biology, ecology, statistics, and medicine.
EPAs risk assessment process has evolved over the years and is described in a number of reports.(1,2,3,4,5) People often have different perceptions of risk based on their personal experiences and knowledge.
Risk assessments are important because they provide a systematic, consistent way of estimating risk.
Risk assessments are used along with other factors in deciding what to do about environmental hazards.
Decisions to prevent or control risk involve the participation and expertise of many different people in government, industry, and the community who have a broad understanding of the risks, laws, community, business, and feasibility of pollution control or prevention methods.
Thus, risk assessments help interested parties decide how to reduce or prevent health risks by offering a common means of analyzing a complex situation.
Most EPA human health or ecological risk assessments address specific substances, such as toxic chemicals, or sites, such as a lake, river, city, industrial facility, or uncontrolled
Risk Assessment Process Step 1: Step 2: Step 3: Step 4: Hazard Identification: Determines whether exposure to a substance can cause cancer, birth defects, or other adverse health effects.
Dose-Response Assessment: Determines the possible severity of adverse health effects at different levels of exposure.
Exposure Assessment: Estimates the amount of contact individuals within a populationincluding potentially sensitive groups, such as childrencould have with the substance.
Risk Characterization: Combines the information in the first three steps to determine the level of potential risk to humans and the environment.

hazardous waste areas.
Typically, a human health risk assessment entails a four-phase process (see box on previous page) to identify the type of adverse health effects, estimate the severity of effects, determine exposure levels, and characterize the overall risk.
Some substances, such as lead, mercury, and nitrates, have prompted EPA to conduct more research and develop better risk assessment methods to protect children from exposure to such substances.
In addition, EPA has begun developing new methods to account for combined exposures to a variety of substances and sources of exposure.
For instance, an individual may be exposed to lead from many sources, such as contaminated drinking water, lead-based paint, and airborne lead in industrial or densely populated areas.
The exposures from
