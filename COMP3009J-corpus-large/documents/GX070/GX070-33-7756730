Presentation: Self-Renewal Pathways in Human ES Cells Whereas mouse ES cells can be readily maintained in a pristine pluripotent state by incubation with the antidifferentiation factor LIF (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor), no such factor has yet been identified to facilitate culture of human ES cells.
We have investigated whether the LIF signaling pathways are functional in human ES cells.
Despite expression of the LIF receptor and the gp130 signaling subunit, and demonstration of the activation of the STAT3 signaling intermediate by treatment of human ES cells with human LIF, the cells nonetheless fail to retain pluripotency.
This argues that mechanisms of self-renewal may be distinct between murine and human ES cells.
We are currently characterizing protein signaling pathways that mediate self-renewal and are employing expression cloning to identify factors that facilitate human ES cell culture.
This work has been aided significantly by methods for viral gene transduction of human ES cells, which will be described.

In 1997 Dr. Firpo came to the University of California, San Francisco, where she directed the derivation of two of the human ES cell lines included in the National Institutes of Health Registry of Human Embryonic Stem Cells.
She is currently working on using human ES cells as a model of human development, differentiating human ES cells into functional tissues for transplantation and deriving new lines suitable for transplantation therapies.
Presentation: Culture and Genetic Modification of Human Embryonic Stem Cells The focus of the Firpo lab is the regulation of stem cell growth, both from the perspective of the maintenance of stem cell potential and the regulated differentiation to functional tissues.
We are interested in embryonic, fetal, and adult stem cells.
Our lab has two areas of active research.
First, we have developed a model of in utero hematopoietic transplantation in mice.
For this model, we isolate populations of cells containing hematopoietic stem cells from adult and fetal mice and embryonic stem cells using specific antibodies.
The cells are then injected into fetal mice through the uterine wall.
At various times after birth, the injected mice are analyzed to determine whether engraftment has occurred, and the degree of contribution of donor cells in hematopoietic tissues, including peripheral blood, bone marrow, and spleen.
The remaining two projects are part of our human embryonic stem (hES) program.
This project covers the distribution of hES cells to other labs, both at UCSF and to academic institutions throughout the world.
This project requires the expansion and characterization of the two hES lines that we have derived at UCSF and that are included in the NIH Human Embryonic Stem Cell Registry.
As part of the characterization of the cell lines, we will determine what is required to maintain hES cells in an undifferentiated state.
We are also characterizing the differentiation capacity of these cells.
Finally, we have established a training program to help establish hES culture techniques in other labs through hands-on training of individuals visiting our lab.
The second project involving hES cells explores the regulation of differentiation of hES cells into mature cells of several tissues.
Currently, we are actively differentiating hematopoietic precursors and mature populations, hepatocytes, pancreatic islet cells, neural progenitors, and neural cells.
We have constructed plasmid expression vectors containing reporter genes under the control of both tissue-specific and ubiquitously expressed promoters.
Ultimately, development of methods of genetic alteration will allow us to regulate differentiation, isolate populations that may be suitable for transplantation therapies, and follow the engraftment of embryonic stem cell- derived tissues.
In addition to monitoring the differentiation and genetic status of subclones, we assay the differentiation to the various cell lineages through an assessment of the expression of tissue-specific cell-surface markers.
In summary, this lab is studying two questions related to stem cell biology.
First, what is required to keep a stem cell a stem cell, while allowing it to proliferate? Second, what signals regulate the steps that stem cells take after they become committed to differentiate?

Presentation: Elucidation of the Transcriptome of ES Cells: A Progress Report Embryonic stem (ES) cells are derived from an inner cell mass of a blastocyst, 3 to 5 days postfertilization.
These cells are totipotent and can proliferate without differentiation in vitro for an extended period of time.
These cells can develop to derivatives from all 3 embryonic germ layers and are generating tremendous excitement.
A limited number of the ES cells have been approved for further study by federally funded researchers.
Laboratories around the world are engaged in the study of regulation of specific genes transcribed in the ES cells; however, the full composition of the transcriptome is yet unknown.
We have undertaken to fill in this gap by investigating the transcriptome of a number of the currently available cell lines by 5' expressed sequence tag sequencing and serial analysis of gene expression (SAGE).
In this presentation, I will report on the results of the first library from the WA01 cells and the corresponding trophoblasts, describe the other ongoing research, and provide Web addresses from which the data can be obtained.

Presentation: Induction and Isolation of Spinal Motor Neurons from Human ES Cells: A Prototype for the Targeted Acquisition of Desired Neuronal Phenotypes (Additional Authors: Neeta Singh Roy and Takahiro Nakano, Cornell University Medical College) Both the experimental and clinical use of human ES (hES)-derived neurons has been limited by the phenotypic heterogeneity of these cells and by the persistence of undifferentiated cells and undesired phenotypes in nominally enriched preparations of hES-derived neurons.
To address the need for pure subpopulations of hES-derived neurons, of a defined and preselected phenotype and devoid of undifferentiated contaminants, we have established a promoter-based strategy for serially inducing and purifying specific neuronal subtypes from hES cells.
As one of several initial target phenotypes, we have generated and purified spinal motor neurons, a cell type lost in the motor neuron degenerative diseases as well as in both spinal cord injury and peri-infectious motor neuronopathies.
To select spinal motor neurons from hES cultures (WiCell, H1), we used retinoic acid (RA) and sonic hedgehog (SHH) to first induce motor neuron phenotype, as previously described in mouse ES cells (Wichterle, Cell 110:385, 2002).
We then isolated the newly generated motor neurons from these cultures, using fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) on the basis of GFP driven by Hb9, a gene that encodes a motor neuron-selective transcription factor.
Specifically, we had found that a highly conserved 3.6 kb segment of the 5' regulatory region of the Hb9 gene was sufficient to specify gene expression to motor neurons.
On that basis, we established a motor neuron-selection vector, in which this 3.6 kb Hb9 enhancer was placed 5' to an hsp68 basal promoter driving EGFP.
The resultant plasmid E/Hb9:EGFP was transfected into hES cultures, which were treated with SHH/RA.
This treatment resulted in the induction of motor neurons within the hES cultures, which could be identified on the basis of E/Hb9-driven GFP expression.
Flow cytometry showed that the EGFP+ cells constituted 1.1 Â± 0.3% (n=3, Â± SE) of the total cell population, or 4.6% after correction, for our net transfection efficiency of 24%.
FACS allowed the near-purification of these E/Hb9:GFP+ cells, virtually all of which co-expressed Islet1 protein.
When raised in GDNF/BDNF, with and without human muscle cell co-culture, the E/Hb9:P/hsp68:EGFP+ cells also expressed choline acetyltransferase, indicating their cholinergic transmitter phenotype; all co-expressed the generic neuronal markers bIII-tubulin and MAP-2.
Importantly, no detectable expression was noted of any markers of undifferentiated ES cells, which included SSEA-4 and Tra-1-81.
The sorted motor neurons achieved functional maturation within 2 to 3 weeks, as indicated by both their glutamate-induced calcium responses upon confocal calcium imaging and by their fast sodium currents and action potentials on whole-cell patch-clamp analysis.
Thus, the serial induction of motor neuron phenotype by RA and SHH, followed by E/Hb9(3.6):EGFP-based FACS, permitted the high-yield generation and purification of functional motor neurons from human embryonic stem cells.
This approach may be used as a prototype for the specific selection and purification of defined neuronal subpopulations from otherwise mixed cultures of human embryonic stem cells.
This work was supported by Project ALS and the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke, NIH.

He is currently an Associate Professor of Obstetrics and Gynecology and an Associate Professor at the Wisconsin National Primate Research Center.
Presentation: Differentiation Into Placental Trophoblast Cells Trophoblast differentiation and placental morphogenesis are the earliest events in mammalian development and yet are virtually impossible to study in humans.
Human embryonic stem (hES) cells have captured the public imagination as a source of cells for regenerative medicine and reconstitution of diseased organs.
Human ES cells also provide an unprecedented opportunity to improve our understanding of the basic processes of early human development.
We have evaluated the expression of trophoblast markers in differentiating ES cells.
Trophoblast differentiation is initiated during embryoid body formation, as demonstrated by secretion of chorionic gonadotropin, progesterone and estrogen, and the expression of the nonpolymorphic MHC class I trophoblast marker HLA-G.
We propose that hES in vitro differentiation systems, such as the formation of embryoid bodies, will allow for an investigation of factors and regulatory pathways that direct both trophoblast differentiation and placental morphogenesis.

James Huettner, Ph.D., received his Ph.D. in neurobiology from Harvard Medical School in 1987.
His graduate research with Robert Baughman focused on the physiology of synaptic transmission in cultures of rat cerebral cortex.
From 1986 to 1988, he was a Junior Fellow in the Harvard University Society of Fellows.

He began studying the physiology of pluripotent stem cells in 1992 as part of an ongoing collaboration with David Gottlieb and John McDonald to analyze the neural differentiation of P19 embryonic carcinoma cells, mouse embryonic stem (ES) cells and, more recently, human ES cells.
Presentation: Physiology of Human ES Cells Ion channels and electrical signaling play important roles in neurons, muscle, and secretory cells.
The normal operation of these cells requires the coordinated interaction of currents through a variety of different channels that have distinct gating and permeation properties.
Aberrant channel expression, or production of channels with abnormal properties, can have pathological consequences.
Thus, the development of successful therapies involving human ES cells will require the functional evaluation of their electrical signaling capabilities.
Physiological recordings from differentiating ES cells allow for the direct evaluation of ion channel characteristics and for cellular electrical signaling.
Studies of mouse ES cells differentiating along the neural lineage have revealed physiological characteristics that parallel the properties of primary neurons and glia.
Mouse ES-derived neurons express voltage-gated sodium and potassium channels that underlie the action potential.
They also express a variety of neurotransmitter-activated ion channels as well as voltage-gated calcium channels, which are required for calcium-dependent transmitter release.
Within 2 to 3 weeks after induction, mouse ES-derived neurons form functional excitatory and inhibitory synapses.
Recordings from undifferentiated mouse and human ES cells reveal a much simpler physiological phenotype.
Undifferentiated ES cells express voltage-dependent currents and intercellular junctions that may be important for cells in the undifferentiated state, but they lack most of the voltage- and ligand-gated currents that are observed in differentiated neurons and glia.

Recently, human embryonic stem cells have been utilized in this research to produce human cardiac myocytes for basic cellular electrophysiology studies.
Presentation: Human Embryonic Stem Cells Develop into Multiple Types of Cardiac Myocytes: Action Potential Characterization Human embryonic stem (hES) cells can differentiate in vitro, forming embryoid bodies (EBs) composed of derivatives of all three embryonic germ layers.
Spontaneously contracting outgrowths from these EBs contain cardiomyocytes (CMs); however, the types of human CMs and their functional properties are unknown.
This study characterizes the contractions and action potentials (APs) from beating EB outgrowths cultured for 40 to 95 days.
Spontaneous and electrical field-stimulated contractions were measured with video edge-detection microscopy.
Beta-adrenergic stimulation with 1.0 Âµmol/L isoproterenol resulted in a significant increase in contraction magnitude.
Intracellular electrical recordings using sharp KCl microelectrodes in beating EB outgrowths revealed three distinct classes of APs: nodal-like, embryonic atrial-like, and embryonic ventricular-like.
The APs were described as embryonic based on the relatively depolarized resting membrane potential and slow AP upstroke.
Repeated impalements of an individual beating outgrowth revealed a reproducible AP morphology from different cells, indicating that each outgrowth is composed of a predominant cell type.
Complex functional properties typical of cardiac muscle were observed in the hES cell-derived CMs, including rate adaptation of AP duration and provoked early and delayed afterdepolarizations.
Repolarization of the AP showed a significant role for- IKr based on E4031-induced prolongation of AP duration, as anticipated for human CMs.
In conclusion, hES cells can differentiate into multiple types of CMs displaying functional properties characteristic of embryonic human cardiac muscle.
Thus, hES cells provide a renewable source of distinct types of human cardiac myocytes for basic research, pharmacological testing, and potentially, therapeutic applications.

Presentation: Stromal and Cytokine Requirements To Support Hematopoietic Differentiation of Human Embryonic Stem Cells Human embryonic stem (ES) cells offer an extraordinary resource to define the proteins and genetic pathways that regulate the earliest stages of human blood development.
We have compared two different methods to support derivation of hematopoietic cells from human ES cells: stromal cell co-culture and embryoid body (EB) formation.
Initial studies demonstrated co-culture of human ES cells with stromal cells derived from hematopoietic microenvironments in media containing FBS, but no other exogenous cytokines promoted blood development.
Under these conditions, we could readily identify CD34+ precursor cells and hematopoietic colony-forming cells (CFCs) that produce characteristic erythroid, myeloid, and megakaryocytic colonies when placed in a standard methylcellulose assay.
Mature CD45+ cells are also demonstrated in this system.
Subsequent studies have been done to better characterize the contribution of cell-bound and soluble factors to support this hematopoietic development.
Coculture of ES cells and S17 cells in serum-free media leads to few CFCs.
However, the addition of cytokines known to support hematopoietic expansion, stem cell factor (SCF), thrombopoietin (TPO) and flt3-ligand (flt3L) to the serum-free media results in increased numbers of CFCs.
Transwell culture experiments demonstrate that direct contact between ES cells and stromal cells is not required.
This led us to examine hematopoietic differentiation by EB formation.
Here, we observe derivation of CD34+, CD45+ cells, and CFCs when EBs are allowed to differentiate in media-containing serum, but not under serum-free conditions.
However, unlike the stromal cell co-culture method, the addition of SCF, flt3L, and TPO to EBs grown in serum-free media did not result in significant CFC development.
These results suggest that cytokines may act on stromal cells to produce additional factors that support survival and growth of hematopoietic cells.

Presentation: Human Embryonic Stem Cells, a Practicum (and Stem Cells on Land and on Sea) Keeping current with cutting-edge techniques requires flexible, expedient approaches to effective practical training.
In response to the rapid rate of technological advancement in biomedical sciences, The Jackson Laboratory (TJL) has instituted a series of intensive, hands-on courses.
Our premise is that a quick response to the immediate needs of the everchanging scientific and technological landscape is crucial.
Efficient transfer of techniques and methodologies to researchers who will use and disperse them brings rigor to a rapidly emerging field.
Moreover, gathering a small group of innovators from around the world to teach the students promotes learning and interactions among them, further advancing nascent research areas.
The formula we have adopted focuses faculty attention on training a cadre of students through short morning lectures to illustrate hands-on principles and through extended long sessions in the laboratory.
A separate meeting immediately following the practicum supplies perspective and further emersion in the field of study.
The 2002 Human Embryonic Stem Cell Course at TJL, and the accompanying meeting (a joint venture with the Mount Desert Island Biological Laboratory), Stem Cells on Land and on Sea, were conceived as a response to the change in the political climate that made Government funding of this research area a possibility.
Informal interactions led to a course and a conference outline and NIH grant applications for funding.
We will discuss both meetings, which were held in 2002 and are planned for July or August 2003.

(See the presentation by our collaborator, Dr. Huettner, for physiological characteristics.)
We are in the process of characterizing the expression of connexin hemichannels using the above approaches.
We have compared and contrasted these characteristics of human ES cells with our previous work on mouse ES cells and will present a summary of these results.
Multiple novel features of human and mouse ES cells have been uncovered that offer potential toward strategies to repair the damaged nervous system.
The human ES cell system will be discussed within this therapeutic target domain.

Ronald McKay, Ph.D., is the Chief of the Laboratory of Molecular Biology in the Basic Neuroscience Program of the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke.
He has held this position since April 1993 when he moved from MIT.
Dr. McKay has also worked at Oxford University and at Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory.
He received his doctorate for work in nucleic acid chemistry with Dr. Ed Southern at the University of Edinburgh.
His recent work focuses on the stem cells of the central nervous system but also influences thinking in other areas of medicine, including diabetes and cancer.
Presentation: Functional Somatic Cells From ES Cells Work from our group played an important role in the early period when stem cells of the central nervous system were first defined (McKay R. Science.
276:66-71, 1997).
Our more recent work contributes to our fundamental understanding of three major processes in the developing nervous system: (1) cell cycle control (Tsai, R.Y. and R. McKay Genes 
Genes Dev. 15: 2094-2110, 2001) and (3) the early steps in neuronal differentiation (Vicario-Abejon, C. et al.
Eur.J.Neurosci.
12: 677-688, 2000).
Recent advances in the application of stem cell biology to Parkinson's disease clearly demonstrates the potential importance of stem cells in models of neuronal loss or injury (Studer, L. et al.
Nat.Neurosci.
1: 290-295, 1998; Lee, S-H. et al.
Nat.Biotechnol.
18: 675-679, 2000; Kim, J-H. et al.
Nature 418: 50-6, 2002).
We have also made contributions in other areas, for example, in glial transplantation (Brustle, O. et al.
Science 285: 754-756, 1999), adult neurogenesis (Cameron, H.A. and R.D. McKay Nat.Neurosci.
2: 894-897, 1999; Cameron, H.A. and R.D. McKay J.Comp.Neurol.
435: 406-17, 2001) and endocrine pancreatic differentiation (Lumelsky, N. et al.
Science 292: 1389-1394, 2001).
These results suggest that this field will generate a powerful technology to analyze fate and function in many cell types.

Martin D. Pera, Ph.D., is Associate Professor and Co-Director of the Centre for Early Human Development at the Monash Institute of Reproduction and Development.
He obtained his B.A. degree in English language and literature from the College of William and Mary in Virginia and his Ph.D. in pharmacology from George Washington University.
Dr. Pera was awarded an NIH National Research Service Award, and conducted postdoctoral research at the Institute of Cancer Research and the Imperial Cancer Research Fund, both in London.
Thereafter, he led research teams at the Institute of Cancer Research and at Oxford University before coming to Monash University.
Dr. Pera is an expert in the cell biology of human pluripotent stem cells, having pioneered the development and characterization of human embryonal carcinoma cell lines, work which led directly to the isolation of human embryonic stem (ES) cells from blastocysts by his laboratory.
The Monash group was the second in the world to isolate human ES cells and the first to demonstrate somatic differentiation of these cells in vitro.
His recent invited lecture presentations include those at the International Alpha Congress on Assisted Reproduction (Copenhagen, 1999), Ontogeny Corporation (Boston, 2000), Australian Society for Biomaterials (Melbourne, 2000), Serono Symposium on Embryos Stem Cells and Transplantation (Canberra, 2000), IMSUT Symposium for Stem Cell Biology (Tokyo, 2000), Royal Society of Edinburgh Meeting on Cloning Stem Cells and Cell Therapy (Edinburgh, 2000), ICDB (Gold Coast, 2000), Genomics Institute of the Novartis Foundation (La Jolla, 2000), Japanese Society for Hematological Transplantation (Kyoto, 2000), Cold Spring Harbor Stem Cell and Progenitor Cell Conference (2001), Royal Society Discussion Meeting on Stem Cells (2001), Sheffield University Symposium on Stem Cells (2001), the Seoul Symposium on Stem Cells and Therapeutic Cloning (2001), and the International Society for Developmental Neuroscience (2002).

He has advised the Australian federal government and the Victorian State government, the U.S. NIH, and the UK Department of Health on scientific matters relating to the ethics of the use of ES cells in research and medicine.
Dr. Pera is co-inventor on four provisional patents relating to human ES cells and is a founding scientist of ESI, an Australian-Singapore biotechnology company founded to develop and exploit human ES cell technology.
The research in Dr. Pera's laboratory focuses on the control of growth and the differentiation of human ES cells.
His team members are trying to identify the signals that determine whether a stem cell will multiply to produce more stem cells, or instead turn into a precursor of a specialized body cell, such as nerve or muscle.
Dr. Pera's laboratory has a special interest in the differentiation of stem cells into endodermal progenitors, cells in the embryo committed to forming the liver, gut, lung, and pancreas.
By understanding the early events in this pathway, the team can direct stem cells to form pancreatic cells more efficiently.
These pancreatic cells will in turn have many uses in research into diabetes and may eventually be used in transplantation therapy to treat these diseases.
Presentation: Human Embryonic Stem Cells: Technical Aspects of Growth Characterization and Manipulation Our laboratory studies the basic biology of human embryonic stem cells and the early phases of their differentiation.
I will discuss systems used currently in our laboratory for the derivation and culture of embryonic stem cells, approaches to the characterization of stem cells, and some methodologies used in studying embryonic stem cell differentiation.

Presentation: Stem Cell Biology The Stem Cell Biology section of the Laboratory of Neurosciences at the NIA focuses on the cellular and molecular mechanisms that regulate the proliferation, differentiation, and survival of stem and progenitor cells during development and in the adult.
This research is based firmly on the concept that the same signaling mechanisms that regulate the development and plasticity of the nervous system are altered during aging and in age-related neurodegenerative disorders.
Accordingly, an understanding of developmental mechanisms is likely to lead to novel approaches to preventing and treating neurological disorders of aging.
Ongoing research is divided into four interrelated areas: (1) signal transduction mechanisms regulating the proliferation, differentiation, and survival of embryonic stem cells and pluripotent neural stem cells; (2) cellular and molecular alterations that occur in neural stem cells during aging and in age-related neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases; (3) elucidation of the mechanisms whereby environmental factors, such as diet and intellectual and physical activity, can alter stem cell biology; and (4) development of novel stem cell therapy-based approaches for repairing the aging and diseased nervous system.

Presentation: NIH Technology Transfer: Facilitating Access to hESCs After President Bush announcement his human embryonic stem cell (hESC) policy on August 9, 2001, it became clear that one of the many hurdles to the distribution of these cells would be the negotiation of agreements governing their transfer.
NIH decided that its Office of Technology Transfer (OTT) would negotiate agreements with the hESC providers to provide cells to Public Health Service intramural researchers, including researchers working at the NIH, Food and Drug Administration, and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).
The agreements would also require that the hESC providers offer no more restrictive terms to NIH-funded nonprofit institutions.
Extramural institutions could then choose to accept the same reasonable terms or attempt to negotiate alternative agreements for themselves to suit their particular needs, policies, or local laws.
The OTT began negotiations first with WARF/WiCell, which owns the dominant patents that likely govern most, if not all, the approved hESC lines.
WARF/WiCell entered into a Memorandum of Understanding in September 2001.
By spring 2002, NIH had entered into similar agreements with BresaGen, ES Cell International, and the University of California, San Francisco.
In addition, NIH has required recipients of infrastructure grants for the scale up and distribution of hESCs to provide an acceptable plan for the distribution of cells to researchers.
This talk will survey the intellectual property and policy issues that surround these agreements and the sharing of research materials that will ultimately be derived from hESC lines.
Such policies seek to balance the needs of the research community to conduct research in an unencumbered manner with the intellectual property incentives companies need to invest in the development of new therapeutics that ultimately better public health.

Presentation: In Vivo Engraftment and Multilineage Differentiation of Human Embryonic Stem Cell (hESC)-Derived Hematopoietic Cells in Primary Fetal Sheep Recipients (Additional authors: A.D. Narayan, J.A. Thomson, R.L. Lewis, D.S. Kaufman, and G.Almeida-Porada, Department of Animal Biotechnology, University of Nevada, Reno, NV; Wisconsin Regional Primate Center; and Departments of Anatomy and Internal Medicine, University of Wisconsin, Madison, WI) We used transplantation into primary pre-immune fetal sheep recipients (55 to 62 days-old, term: 145 days) to evaluate the in vivo potential of hematopoietic elements derived from hESCs.
The in utero human/sheep xenograft model has proven valuable in assessing the in vivo hematopoietic activity of stem cells from a variety of fetal and postnatal human sources.
Three transplant groups with cells from differentiated hESCs (H1 and H1.1) were established.
Human ESC was differentiated on the mouse S17 cell line for 17 days.
The 17-day cultures were found to be positive for CD34, CD133, CD38, gly-A, CD33, CD15, CD10, CD56, and nestin and were negative for CD45, CD3, CD2, HLA-DR, CD19, CD8, CD4, CD14, and CD20.
Each fetus (n=7) in group 1 was transplanted with 0.75-2.8 x 105 CD34+/CD38- cells isolated from the day 17 cultures by sorting.
The fetuses in group 2 (n=13) were given 0.13 - 0.95 x 105 CD34+/Lin- cells/fetus obtained from the day 17 cultures by sorting, while the fetuses in group 3 (n=12) were transplanted with 1 - 1.5 x 105 whole-day 17 culture cells/fetus.
The animals in groups 1 and 2 were allowed to complete gestation and be born.
As can typically happen, 3 recipients (2 in group 1, 1 in group 2) were lost to study (fetus absorbed).
Four animals in group 1 and 5 animals in group 2 were found to be chimeric with a variety of donor (human) cell types that in some cases have persisted for 13 months post-transplant.
For example, the relative percentages of human cells expressing CD34, CD45, CD3, CD13, CD133, CD38, HLA-DR, and CD2 at 5 months post-transplant in a representative animal in group 1 were 0.05, 0.26, 0.20, 0.10, 0.15, 0.09, 4.4, and 0.04, while at 3 months post-transplant the values for cells expressing CD45, CD3, CD133, CD38, HLA-DR, and Gly-A for a representative animal in group 2 were: 0.5, 0.6, 0.4, 0.3, 0.6, and 0.5 respectively.
The donor (human) cells appear to be responsive to human cytokines.
The administration of human G-CSF to animals chimeric with CD34+/CD38- cells on two separate occasions, at 4 and 12 months post-transplant, resulted in increased donor cell activity.
Increases in human cell activity were also noted in chimeric group 1 and group 2 animals treated with human GM-CSF.
Two of the recipients in group 3 were sacrificed at 2 months post-transplant (i.e., 1 month before birth).
Both were negative for human hematopoietic cell activity.
The remaining group 3 animals will be evaluated at birth and at intervals thereafter.
Careful examination of these two animals and of 4 additional animals from groups 1 and 2 sacrificed at intervals after birth failed to reveal any gross anatomical abnormalities; all live animals appear to be healthy.
These findings indicate that hematopoietic cells derived from hESC can engraft and undergo multilineage differentiation in the human/sheep model.
Serial transplantations into secondary and/or tertiary fetal sheep recipients will establish whether the hematopoietic activity in these primary hosts can be attributed to long-term engrafting cells.

Su-Chun Zhang, M.D., Ph.D., received his M.D. (1984) and M.Sc. degrees (1989) in China and his Ph.D. training (1996) in Canada in neural and cell biology, with a focus on the biology and pathology of oligodendroglia and microglia.
In his subsequent career, he studied the differentiation of oligodendroglia from neural stem cells and the transplantation of neural stem/progenitors in animal models of myelin disorders.
Dr. Zhang is currently an Assistant Professor of Anatomy and Neurology at the Waisman Center, University of Wisconsin-Madison.
His research, funded by NIH and private research foundations, explores the potential of embryonic stem cells as a model for early human neural development, such as neural induction and neural patterning, and as a source for generating therapeutically active cells for neurodegenerative diseases.
Presentation: Neural Specification of Human Embryonic Stem Cells Human embryonic stem (hES) cells not only provide a continuous cell source for potential cell therapy but also offer an otherwise inaccessible system to unveil events of early embryonic development in humans.
We have established a stepwise, chemically defined culture system that directs the hES cells to neuroepithelia, the earliest neural cells.
The process of neuroepithelial specification resembles in vivo neural induction in terms of timing, formation of neural tube-like structures, and response to FGF signaling.
Using this in vitro model system, we are dissecting the molecular mechanisms underlying neural specification from hES cells.
The in vitro-generated neuroepithelial cells can differentiate into neurons and glial cells in culture and after transplantation into rodent brain.
To determine whether the hES cell-derived neuroepithelial cells can be preferentially fated to a particular neural lineage, we employ the principle of neural patterning and are establishing culture systems that persuade the neuroepithelial cells to choose a particular neuronal or glial fate, such as midbrain dopamine neurons, spinal cord motoneurons, or myelinating oligodendrocytes.
The function of the in vitro-generated mature neural cells will be assessed using electrophysiological techniques to measure action potentials and synaptic communication in neurons in culture and after transplantation into rodent brain and spinal cord.
We hope that an understanding of neural induction and patterning in humans will lead to an optimized procedure for generating enriched or purified neuroepithelia and specialized neural cells, which will lay groundwork for potential future use of human ES cells in the treatment of neurological injuries and diseases.
