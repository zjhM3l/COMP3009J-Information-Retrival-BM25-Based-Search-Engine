Miscellaneous Resource Materials: Information on minor or occasional vertebrate pests including birds, marmots, porcupines, snakes, and other wildlife species.
Not available for general distribution presently but materials are supplied on request in response to specific problems.
In Person Program: Request for in person programs are encouraged.
Program format is usually in the form of slides and display of vertebrate pest control materials.
Programs can be individualized to address problems and questions of concern in your area.
Individuals requesting programs are encouraged to suggest areas of greatest interest to the people attending.
Field Demonstrations: In field, hands-on field demonstrations of current rodent control methods.
These need to be scheduled during optimum control periods for each rodent species.
Ground squirrels - spring to early summer.
Pocket gophers - spring, early summer and fall.
Prairie dogs - late summer to early fall.
Depending on the specialist's schedule, some programs and demonstrations can be arranged on short notice, For best results, requests should be made 3-4 weeks in advance at the minimum.
To conserve travel and time, it is helpful if counties in an area coordinate training to make effective use of the specialist's time.
Specific Training for Applicator Licensing: M-44 (Sodium Cyanide) - Coyote Control Livestock Protection Collar (1080) - Coyote Control
Special Problems: Specialists are available to assist or advise counties or individuals on a variety of special or unusual vertebrate pest problems.
Please feel free to ask.
If it's beyond our ability or responsibility we can usually direct you to the best assistance available.
