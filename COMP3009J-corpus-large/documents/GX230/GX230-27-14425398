IDOC Honor Guard members Tom Ogilvy and Mary Anne Casper competed May 25 in the U.S. Pipe Band Championships in Alma, Mich., as part of the St. Andrews Society of Central Illinois Pipes and Drums.
The band, which competed for the first time there, took first place in Grade IV against 16 bands from throughout the U.S. and Canada.
Ogilvy is the pipe major of the band, and Casper is one of nine pipers and six drummers who competed.
The band also will compete this summer in Kansas City, Chicago, Ontario, Canada, the Quad Cities, and St. Louis.
Ogilvy and Casper, who serve at IDOC's General Headquarters in Springfield, perform as bagpipers in the agency's Honor Guard at ceremonies that include the Memorial Wall Service, Correctional Officer of the Year and Volunteer of the Year.
