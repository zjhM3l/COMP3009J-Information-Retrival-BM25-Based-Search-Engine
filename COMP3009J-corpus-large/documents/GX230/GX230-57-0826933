AVAILABILITY OF POPULATION SCHEDULES Microfilmed copies of the Census schedules from 1790 to 1920 (1930 after April 1, 2002) are available at the National Archives Building, 700 Pennsylvania Avenue, NW, Washington, DC; at the National Archives Regional Offices (see Appendix A); and through the National Archives Microfilm Rental Program.
Title 44, U.S. Code, allows the public to use the National Archives' census record holdings after 72 years, thus the 1790 to 1920 records are available to the public on microfilm from the National Archives.
After April 1, 2002, individual records from the 1930 census will be made available.
The U.S. Census Bureau holds only the records for 1930 through 2000 (after April 1, 2000, the Census Bureau will hold census records from 1940 to 2000).
The agency's Personal Census Search Unit, in Jeffersonville, IN, maintains and searches these records, which are confidential by law (Title 13, U.S. Code).1 As a result of fire, damage, or other loss, census records on microfilm are not entirely complete.
The most notable gap in coverage is for 1890.
As a result of a 1921 fire at the Department of Commerce, surviving records are limited to portions of Alabama, the District of Columbia, 1 A form BC-600, ``Application for Search of Census Records,'' is required to obtain census records still held by the Census Bureau.
This application can be downloaded, using Adobe Acrobat from the following address: www.census.gov/genealogy/www/bc600.pdf.
Georgia, Illinois, Minnesota, New Jersey, New York, North Carolina, Ohio, South Dakota, and Texas plus the special 1890 schedules enumerating Union veterans of the Civil War and their widows for Kentucky and Wyoming (See Appendix C).
Figure 1 shows the decennial population schedules from 1790 through 1920, together with SOUNDEX indexes for 1880, 1900, 1910, and 1920, for which microfilmed copies are available for public use through the National Archives, its regional branches, and at libraries in various parts of the country.
(Pursuant to Title 44, U.S. Code, the National Archives will open the 1930 records to the public after April 1, 2002).
The National Archives sells or rents the microfilm publications listed on the chart to individuals and institutions, and some libraries are willing to release copies through interlibrary loan.
The National Archives periodically issues catalogs for use in ordering the microfilm and publishes checklists of institutional holdings.
See the bibliography Electronic data processing.
In the mid-1940s, the Census Bureau and scientists from the National Bureau of Standards began studying the use of electronic computers for large-scale data processing.
In 1951, the Census Bureau acquired the UNIVAC 1 built according to the Census Bureau's requirements and experimental processing began following the 1950 census.
Together with a second UNIVAC, tabulations were successfully completed for a number of programs, including the majority of the 1954 Economic Census.

Measuring America U.S. Census Bureau
To meet the needs of the 1960 Census, the Census Bureau obtained two new 1105 computers in October and December, 1959.
As a result of a cooperative agreement between the Census Bureau and the University of North Carolina and the Armour Research Foundation of the Illinois Institute of Technology, a UNIVAC 1105 was installed at each university that was compatible with those housed at the Census Bureau.
Each university allocated two-thirds of the ``productive'' time on its computers to the census, with additional time (in lesser amount) being afforded the Census Bureau upon completion of the 1960 Census processing.
The Census Bureau also employed the film optical sensing device for input to computers (FOSDIC).
The FOSDIC scanned microfilm copies of appropriately designed questionnaires, read the marks entered by enumerators, and transcribed the information to reels of magnetic tape readable by computer.
When installed on the computers, the data on these tapes were reviewed, tabulated, and finally transferred to other tapes used by high speed printers2--speeding the compilation of census data and making the hiring and training of 2,000 people dedicated to the manual preparation of punch cards obsolete.
2 High-speed printers received data for printing from the magnetic tape reels created by the electronic computers.
Data represented by the magnetized ``spots'' on the tape were printed as tabulations (600 lines per minute) which could be photographed and reproduced by the offset printing process.
Microfilm.
In most cases, census schedules and questionnaires were microfilmed many years after they originated, by which time the ink often had faded and the pages were brittle.
To save valuable storage space after filming, the paper copies were destroyed or (as was the case with the 1880 census) offered to state archives.
While schedules from the period from 1790 to 1880 usually were stored flat in binders secured by cloth tape, later ones, such as the 1890 through 1920, were bound for safekeeping and ready use (for age search, etc.) in large volumes.
When microfilming began around 1940, it was impractical to remove and rebind the pages in those volumes, so they were photographed in place.
The pages were turned for filming, and their legibility, poor at best, sometimes was reduced even further by the camera's inability to focus on the curved surfaces of some pages.
For the years beginning in 1890, when punch card tabulation came into use, clerks used red ink to add alphabetical or numerical codes in certain schedule columns (such as the one for veteran status) for the keypunch operators' guidance.
These codes represent occupation, number of persons in the household, and the like information already appearing on the schedule.
As the microfilm is only in black and white, this color cannot be distinguished.
The reader should recognize and ignore these codes as extraneous when transcribing or interpreting what appears on the film.

AVAILABILITY OF THE 1930 CENSUS RECORDS The 1930 census and all existing soundex indexes will become available after April 1, 2002, at the National Archives in Washington, DC, and its thirteen regional facilities.
Indexes using the soundex indexing system will be available for the states of Alabama, Arkansas, Florida, Georgia, Kentucky (Bell, Floyd, Harlan, Kenton, Muhlenberg, Perry, and Pike counties only), Louisiana, Mississippi, North Carolina, South Carolina, Tennessee, Virginia, and West Virginia (Fayette, Harrison, Kanawha, Logan, McDowell, Mercer, and Raleigh counties only).
Additional information about the 1930 census records, soundex index, and ordering information will be available from the National Archives after April 1, 2002.
FINDING GUIDES All decennial census schedules are arranged geographically, not by name, so an address or an index generally is necessary to find a particular record.
In 1908, the U.S. Census Bureau prepared a 12-volume work entitled Heads of Families at the First Census of the United States Taken in the Year 1790 [state] that reproduces the completed 1790 schedules in printed form with indexes.
Various individuals and organizations have compiled alphabetical indexes for 19th century censuses, generally through 1870, and these can be found in many libraries and genealogical collections.
There are SOUNDEX or MIRACODE indexes for 1880 (only households with children 10 years of age or younger), 1900, 1910 (21 states only, mainly in the South), and 1920.
These indexes, based on the sound of the surname, originally were prepared to assist the Census Bureau in finding records for persons who needed official proof of age from a period before all states had a uniform system of registering births.
There is a separate index for each of the above years for each state or territory.
The U.S. Census Bureau also created an index for selected cities in the 1910 census that translates specific street addresses into the appropriate enumeration district number and corresponding volume number of the schedules.
The 1840 Census.
This census included a special enumeration of military pensioners.
The names and ages listed were printed in A Census of Pensioners for Revolutionary or Military Services; With Their Names, Ages, Places of Residence, Washington, DC: Department of State, 1841 (reprinted by the Genealogical Publishing Co., Baltimore, MD, in 1967) and reproduced at the end of roll 3 in National Archives microfilm publication T498.
The 1885 Census.
Five states and territories chose to take an 1885 census with federal assistance.
The schedules show the same type of information as those for 1880, but in many cases the initial letters of enumerated persons' given names appear instead for the names themselves.

The 1890 Records.
The majority of 1890 census records were destroyed as a result of a fire in January 1921.
The smoke, water, and other damage to the bound volumes was such that only fragments remained to be microfilmed in later years.
The surviving records are available on three rolls, National Archives Publication M407.
The three rolls cover the following areas: 1.
Alabama.
Perry County (Perryville Beat No. 11 and Severe Beat No. 8).
2.

A number of the special schedules of Union veterans of the Civil War and their widows were saved, including those for U.S. vessels and Navy yards.
These were microfilmed as National Archives Publication M123.
State and Territorial Censuses In addition to the 1885 censuses discussed above, many states and territories took their own censuses at various times.
Some were fairly detailed; others contained little more than counts.
They are not within the scope of this document, but they are described in State Censuses: An Annotated Bibliography of Census of Population Taken After the Year 1790 by States and Territories of the United States, prepared by Henry J. Dubester, Library of Congress, Washington, DC: Government Printing Office, 1948, 73 pages 115

Mortality Schedules
In 1850, 1860, 1870, 1880, and 1885 (where applicable), the census included inquiries about persons who had died in the year immediately preceding the enumeration (Figure 2).
In general, the questions covered these topics--

A note about microfilmed schedules for genealogy.
Please note that the microfilmed images of schedules completed by an enumerator can have abbreviations, titles, comments, and even ``doodles,'' that do not correspond to any information contained in the instructions given to each enumerator.
In such cases, the meaning of this entry has been lost with the enumerator.
Furthermore, schedules will frequently have entries (within the schedule or its margins) that seem to have no relation to the question asked.
The meaning of these entries have been lost so many years since the marks were made.
Although these entries may indeed relate to the household, they often are related to the administrative duties conducted during receipt and tabulation of the schedules by Census Bureau clerks.
For example, the letters ``JGG'' (or any other letters, numbers, or words) next to or within an entry may have been the initials of a Census Bureau clerk, used to indicate where he/she stopped for lunch or the end of the workday, or a manager making an administrative note, such as a shift change.
Thus, abbreviations/marks found on the microfilms that are not explicitly identified within the instructions to the enumerators are impossible to definitively understand.
A HISTORY OF THE DECENNIAL CENSUSES: 1790-2000 Censuses of 1790 to 1840 A nationwide population census on a regular basis dates from the establishment of the United States.
Article I, Section 2, of the United States Constitution required that-- ``Representatives and direct taxes shall be apportioned among the several states which may be included within this union, according to their respective numbers, which shall be determined by adding to the whole number of free persons, including those bound to service for a term of years, and excluding Indians not taxed, three-fifths of all other persons.
The actual Enumeration shall be made within three Years after the first Meeting of the Congress of the United States, and within every subsequent term of ten years, in such manner as they shall by law direct.3'' Starting with the 1800 census, the Secretary of State directed the enumeration and, from 1800 to 1840, the marshals reported the results to him.
From 1850 through 1900, the Interior Department, established in 1849, had jurisdiction.
3 In subsequent decades, the practice of ``service for a term of years'' died out.
``Indians not taxes'' were those not living in settled areas and paying taxes; by the 1940s, all American Indians were considered to be taxed.
The 13th Amendment abolished slavery in 1865, and the 14th Amendment to the Constitution, ratified in 1868, officially ended Article 1's ``three-fifths rule.''
Thus, the original census requirements were modified.
Direct taxation based on the census never became practical.
The 1800 and 1810 population censuses were similar in scope and method to the 1790 census.
However, the Congress, statisticians, and other scholars urged that while the populace was being enumerated, other information the new government needed also should be collected.
The first inquiries on manufacturing were made in 1810 and, in later decades, censuses of agriculture, mining, governments, religious bodies (discontinued after 1946), business, housing, and transportation were added to the decennial census.
(Legislation enacted in 1948 and later years specified that the various economic, agriculture, and government censuses would be taken at times that did not conflict with those in which the population and housing censuses occurred.)
The 1830 census related solely to population.
The marshals and their assistants began using uniform printed schedules; before that, they had to use whatever paper was available, rule it, write in the headings, and bind the sheets together.
The census act for the 1840 census authorized the establishment of a centralized census office during each enumeration and provided for the collection of statistics pertaining to ``the pursuits, industry, education, and resources of the country.''
The new population inquiries included school attendance, illiteracy, and type of occupation.
From 1790 through the 1840 census, the household, not the individual, was the unit of enumeration in the population census, and only the names of the household heads appeared on the schedules.
There was no tabulation beyond the simple addition of the entries the marshals had submitted, and there was no attempt to publish details uniformly by cities or towns, or to summarize returns for each state, other than by county, unless the marshals had done so.
Censuses of 1850 to 1890 The act governing the Seventh, Eighth, and Ninth Decennial Censuses (1850-1870) made several changes in census procedures: Each marshal was responsible for subdividing his district into ``known civil divisions,'' such as counties, townships, or wards, and for checking to ensure that his assistants' returns were completed properly.
The number of population inquiries grew; every free person's name was to be listed, as were the items relating to each individual enumerated.
Beginning in 1850, marshals collected additional ``social statistics'' (information about taxes, schools, crime, wages, value of estate, etc.) and data on mortality.
[Decennial mortality schedules for some states and territories exist for 1850-1880 and for a few places in 1885; see Table 2.]
Noteworthy features of the 1870 census included the introduction of a rudimentary tally device to help the clerks in their work and the publications of maps, charts, and diagrams to illustrate the most significant census results.
The general scope of the 1880 census was expanded only slightly over that of 1870, but much greater detail was 125
Measuring America U.S. Census Bureau
obtained for many of the items--so much more that, beyond the basic counts, which were released promptly, publication of these data was not completed until nearly 1890.
The census act of 1880 replaced the marshals and their assistants with specially appointed agents (experts assigned to collect technical data, such as on manufacturing processes), supervisors, and enumerators, every one of whom was forbidden to disclose census information.
Maintaining the confidentiality of the data was a result of what some people regarded as the census' invasion of privacy, especially since prior to the 1880 census, there was no law limiting the extent to which the public could use or see the information on any schedule.
(Subsequent demographic and economic censuses, as well as most surveys, have been carried out according to statutes that make compliance mandatory, with penalties for refusal; and responses confidential, with penalties for disclosure.
Congress codified these laws in 1954 as Title 13, U.S. Code.)
For the first time, enumerators were given detailed maps to follow, so they could account for every street or road and not stray beyond their assigned boundaries.
(The National Archives' Cartographic and Architectural Branch maintains this map collection.4) Again, in 1890, there was an extension of the decennial census's scope, and some subjects were covered in even greater detail than in 1880.
Data were collected in supplemental surveys on farm and home mortgages and private corporations' and individuals' indebtedness.
The 1890 census also used, for the first time in history, a separate schedule for each family.
Herman Hollerith, who had been a special agent for the 1880 census, developed punch cards and electric tabulating machines to process the 1890 census returns, considerably reducing the time needed to complete the clerical work.
(Hollerith's venture became part of what is now the IBM Corporation.)
Both the cards and the machines were improved progressively over the next 50 years.5 The 1890 census was historic in another way.
In the first volume of the results, the Superintendent of the Census wrote-- ``Up to and including 1880, the country had a frontier of settlement, but at present the unsettled area has been so broken into by isolated bodies of settlement that there can hardly be said to be a frontier line.
In
the discussion of its extent, its westward movement, etc., it can not, therefore, any longer have a place in the census reports.6 Commenting on this statement, historian Frederick Jackson Turner wrote in 1893 that, ``up to our own day, American history has been in a large degree the history of the colonization of the Great West.
The existence of an area of free land, its continuous recession, and the advance of American settlement westward, explain American development.''7 The censuses that followed 1890 reflected the filling in, rather than the expansion of, the colonized areas; symbolizing a turning point in America's development as a Nation.
Censuses of 1900 to 2000 Although the censuses in the early 1900s did not witness the expansion of inquiries as had been witnessed in the late nineteenth century, geographic coverage of the census reflected the Nation's growing status as a political and military power.
As a result of the country's expanding global influence, the following areas saw their first censuses administered by the United States in the early 1900s: Â· Following its annexation in 1898, Hawaii (where the local government took a census every 6 years from 1866 though 1896) was included in the 1900 census, which also had the first count of the U.S. population abroad (Armed Forces and Federal civilian employees, and their households).
Â· The War Department carried out an enumeration in Puerto Rico in 1899 following that island's acquisition from Spain in 1898 (there were periodic censuses from 1765 to 1887 under Spanish rule), and there have been decennial censuses conducted in Puerto Rico from 1910 to the present.
Â· The U.S. Census Bureau compiled and published one census of the Philippine Islands following their accession by the United States in 1898; this census was taken under the direction of the Philippine Commission in 1903.
(Under Spanish rule, there had been censuses in 1818 and 1876.
The Philippine legislature directed in 1918, and the Commonwealth's statistical office began periodic enumerations in 1939.
The Philippines became an independent republic in 1946).
Â· The Isthmian Canal Commission ordered a general census of the Panama Canal Zone when the United States took control of the area in 1904; there was another general census in 1912 and several special censuses at various

times.
The Canal Zone was included in the U.S. censuses from 1920 to 1970.
(Sovereignty over the Zone was transferred to the Republic of Panama in 1979.)
Â· Following the United States' occupation of Guam in 1899, the local governor conducted a census there in 1901.
The island has been included in U.S. censuses from 1920 onward.
Â· The governors of American Samoa conducted censuses at various times after the United States acquired the islands in 1900, and the population was enumerated in U.S. censuses from 1920 onward.
Â· Prior to the acquisition of the Danish Virgin Islands by the United States in 1917, the Danish government took periodic censuses between 1835 and 1911.
The U.S. census was conducted in 1917 and the islands appeared in the 1930 and subsequent U.S. censuses.
Â· A census of Cuba was conducted under a provisional U.S. administration in 1907.
There were earlier censuses under Spanish rule (which ended in 1898).
The U.S. War Department conducted an enumeration in 1899, and subsequent censuses were overseen by the Republic (established in 1901) beginning in 1919.
Â· There had been quinquennial Japanese censuses from 1920 to 1940 for the islands that became the U.S. Trust Territory of the Pacific Islands.
The U.S. Navy conducted a census in 1950, and the U.S. High Commissioner carried out a census in 1958, the results of which appeared in the 1960 U.S. census reports.
The U.S. Census Bureau conducted the 1970 and 1980 censuses8; in 1980, 1990, and 2000, there was a separate census of the Northern Mariana Islands, which had been part of the Trust Territory.
A number of the censuses noted above collected data on agriculture, housing, and economic subjects and included enumerations on isolated islands, such as Truk and Yap, mainly in the Pacific.
Stateside Developments From the 1840 through the 1900 censuses, a temporary census office had been established before each decennial enumeration and disbanded as soon as the results were compiled and published.
Congress established a permanent Bureau of the Census in 1902, in the Department of the Interior, so there would be an ongoing organization capable of carrying out censuses throughout the decades instead of concentrating all the work in those years ending in ``0.''
The Census Bureau moved to the new Department of Commerce 8 In 1986, compacts of free association were implemented between the Federated States of Micronesia and the Marshall Islands, and the United States.
Under the terms of Title 13, U.S. Code, the United States was no longer authorized to take the decennial censuses in those areas that were formerly part of the Trust Territory.
and Labor in 1903, and remained within the Department of Commerce when the Department of Labor was split off in 1913.
The 1910 census was the first for which prospective census employees took open competitive examinations throughout the country (since 1880, appointees had been given noncompetitve tests).
The way in which results were published also was changed, with those statistics that were ready first--especially those in greatest demand (such as the total population of individual cities and states, and of the United States as a whole)--issued first as press releases, then in greater detail as bulletins and abstracts, the latter appearing 6 months to 1 year before the final reports were issued.
In 1920 and 1930, there were minor changes in scope.
A census of unemployment accompanied the 1930 census --data were collected for each person reported to have a gainful occupation, but who was not at work on the day preceding the enumerator's visit.
Sampling.
In many ways, 1940 saw the first modern census.
One of its major innovations was the use of statistical techniques, such as probability sampling, that had only been experimented with previously, such as in 1920s crop sampling, a Civil Works Administration trial census and surveys of retail stores conducted in the 1930s, and an official sample survey of unemployment in 1940 that covered about 20,000 households.
Sampling in the 1940 census allowed the addition of several questions for just 5 percent of the persons enumerated, without unduly increasing the overall burden on respondents and on data processing.
Sampling also made it possible to publish preliminary returns 8 months ahead of the complete tabulations.
The Census Bureau was able to increase the number of detailed tables published and review of the quality of the data processing was more efficient.
Most population and housing inquiries included in the 1940 census were repeated in later years, and a few were added, including-- Â· Place of work and means of transportation to work (1960).
Â· Occupation 5 years before the census (1970 and 1980 only).
Â· Housing costs (1980).
Â· Inquiries relating to childcare by grandparents (2000).
In 1940 and 1950, the sample population questions were asked only for those persons whose names fell on the schedules' sample lines.
Sampling was extended to the housing schedule in 1950, with a few questions asked on a cyclic basis: One pair of questions for household 1, another pair for household 2, etc., until household 6, when the cycle was started again with the first pair of questions.
In the 1960 census, the sampling pattern was changed for population and housing questions alike: If a housing unit 127
Measuring America U.S. Census Bureau
was in the sample, all of the household members were in the sample, too.
This scheme yielded sufficient data for accurate estimates of population and housing characteristics for areas as small as a census tract (an average of 4,000 people).
The only population questions asked on a 100-percent basis (name and address, age, sex, race, and since 1980, Hispanic origin, marital status, and relationship to householder), were those necessary to identify the population and avoid duplication.
The sampling pattern changed in later censuses.
For 1970, some sample questions were asked of either a 15-percent or a 5-percent sample of households, but some were asked for both, thus constituting a 20-percent sample.
There was no ``split sample'' for 1980, but it was used at every other household (50 percent) in places with fewer than 2,500 inhabitants and at every sixth household (17 percent) elsewhere.
For Census 2000, the overall sampling rate was 1-in-6 households, but the actual sampling rate for any given geographic entity depended on its estimated population density and included four rates: 1-in-2, 1-in-4, 1-in-6, and 1-in-8 households.
Reflecting the concerns of the Depression years, the 1940 census asked several questions to measure employment and unemployment, internal migration, and income.
It was also the first to include a census of housing that obtained a variety of facts on the general condition of the Nation's housing and the need for public housing programs.
(Prior to this, the housing data collected as part of the population censuses were generally limited to one or two items.)
At the time of the 1950 census, a survey of residential financing was conducted as a related, but separate, operation with information collected on a sample basis from owners of owner-occupied and rental properties and mortgage lenders.
Similar surveys accompanied subsequent censuses.
There also were surveys of components of housing change with the 1960, 1970, and 1980 censuses (but not 1990, when the survey was scheduled for 1989 and 1991).
These measured the quantitative and qualitative impact of basic changes that occurred in the Nation's housing stock during the previous decade.
The survey also offered a measure of ``same'' units, i.e., the preponderant part of the housing inventory that was not affected by the basic changes.
(The first survey of this type had been a key part of the National Housing Inventory in 1956.)
Processing.
The major innovation of the 1950 census was the use of an electronic computer--the Universal Automatic Computer I (UNIVAC I)--the first of a series delivered in 1951 to help tabulate some of the census data.
Nearly all of the data processing was done by computer in the 1960 census.
Beginning in 1960, census data were tabulated with the aid of the film optical sensing device for input to computers (FOSDIC)--an electronic device for ``reading'' the data on questionnaires.
Special questionnaires were designed on which the answers could be indicated by marking small 128
circles.
The completed questionnaires were photographed onto microfilm with automatic cameras.
The FOSDIC then ``read'' the blackened dots (which appeared as clear holes on the negative film) and transferred the data they represented to magnetic tape to be processed by computer at speeds that ranged from 3,000 items a minute in 1960 to 70,000 items per minute by the time the 1990 census data were tabulated.9 Collecting the data.
The 1960 census was the first in which population and housing data were extensively collected by mail.
The field canvass was preceded by the delivery to every occupied housing unit of a questionnaire that contained the 100-percent questions (those asked for all persons and housing units).
Householders were asked to complete the questionnaire and hold it until an enumerator visited.
The sample items were on a different questionnaire.
In urban areas, containing about 80 percent of the Nation's population, the enumerators carried questionnaires containing the sample population and housing questions for every fourth housing unit.
If the units were occupied, the householders were asked to fill out the sample questionnaires themselves and mail them to the census district office.
The enumerators completed the questionnaires for vacant units.
When these questionnaires were received in the district offices, the responses were transcribed to the special FOSDIC schedules.
In rural areas, the enumerators obtained the sample information during their visits, and they recorded it directly on FOSDIC schedules.
The 1970 census marked the use nearly everywhere of separate, FOSDIC-readable household questionnaires--approximately 70 million of them--rather than the large schedules that contained information for four or more households.
Thus, respondents could mark the appropriate answer circles on their questionnaires, which then could be processed directly without transcription.
Subsequent censuses were taken principally by mail--approximately 60 percent of the population in 1970, 90 percent in 1980, and 94 percent or more in 1990 and 2000.
The questionnaires contained the 100-percent and, where appropriate, sample questions.
In areas where the mailout/mailback procedure was used, enumerators contacted, either by telephone or personal visit, only those households that had not returned questionnaires or had given incomplete or inconsistent answers.
For the remainder of the population, most of which was located in rural areas or small towns, postal carriers left a census form containing the 100-percent questions at each residential housing unit on their routes.
An enumerator visited each of these households to collect the completed questionnaires
9 The FOSDIC was replaced for Census 2000 with mark and optical character recognition (OMR and OCR) equipment.
Measuring America U.S. Census Bureau
and ask the additional questions for any household or housing unit in the sample.
These procedures were continued, with modifications, for 1990 and 2000.
In many rural areas, the enumerators, rather than the postal carriers, delivered the questionnaires and asked that they be completed and mailed back.
In some inner-city areas, the enumerators took address lists with them, checked for additional units, and enumerated any persons they found living there.
Publishing.
For 1970, extensive discussions with census data users led to a major increase in the amount of statistics tabulated, especially for small areas.
As part of the 1970 census program, the Census Bureau published 100percent (but not sample) data for each of 1.5 million census blocks (including all blocks in urbanized areas), as compared with 1960, when block data were provided for 750,000 blocks within the city limits of places with 50,000 or more inhabitants.
For 1980, there were data for 1.8 million blocks, with the population limit lowered to include incorporated places with populations of 10,000 or more; several states were ``blocked'' in their entirety.
For 1990 and 2000, the block statistics program was expanded to cover the entire country, or approximately 7.5 million blocks.
The 1970, 1980, and 1990 population and housing census data appear in series of printed reports--either on paper or microfiche, or both--similar to those issued after the 1960 census, with accompanying maps, where appropriate.
In addition, the U.S. Census Bureau issued public-use microdata tapes, usually containing much more detail than the printed reports, for users with computer access.
After 1980, some data were made available on diskettes, online, through commercial computer networks, and by 1990, on CD-ROMs.
Following Census 2000, data were released via the Internet, on CD-ROMs, computer-assisted ``print-ondemand,'' and for some publications, the traditional printed volumes.
INDIVIDUAL HISTORIES OF THE UNITED STATES CENSUSES The First Census: 1790 The first enumeration began on Monday, August 2, 1790, little more than a year after the inauguration of President Washington and shortly before the second session of the first Congress ended.
The Congress assigned responsibility for the 1790 census to the marshals of the U.S. judicial districts under an act that, with minor modifications and extensions, governed census-taking through 1840.
The law required that every household be visited and that completed census schedules be posted in ``two of the most public places within [each jurisdiction],there to remain for the inspection of all concerned . . .'' and that ``the aggregate amount of each description of persons'' for every district be transmitted to the President.
The six inquiries in 1790 called for the name of the head of the family and the number of persons in each household of the following descriptions: Free White males of 16 years and upward (to assess Measuring America U.S. Census Bureau
the country's industrial and military potential), free White males under 16 years, free White females, all other free persons (by sex and color), and slaves.
It is presumed that the Secretary of State (Thomas Jefferson), acting under the authority of the President, sent the marshals within each state, copies of the census act, and the required inquiries10.
The marshals then incorporated these inquiries into ``schedules'' of their own design.
The Second Census: 1800 A February 28, 1800, act provided for the taking of the second census of the United States, which included the states and territories northwest of the Ohio River and Mississippi Territory.
The guidelines for the 1800 enumeration followed those of the first enumeration, except that the work was to be carried on under the direction of the Secretary of State.
The enumeration was to begin, as in 1790, on the first Monday in August, and conclude in 9 calendar months.
The marshals and secretaries were required to deposit the returns of their assistants, which were to be transmitted to the Secretary of State (not the President as in 1790), on or before September 1, 1801.
The Third Census: 1810 The third census, taken by the terms of an act of March 26, 1810, stipulated that the census was to be ``an actual inquiry at every dwelling house, or of the head of every family within each district, and not otherwise'' and commenced on the first Monday of August.
The results of the 1810 census were published in a 180page volume.
Data for the population were presented by counties and towns in the northern sections of the country (except New York, which was by counties only), and in Ohio, Kentucky, and Georgia.
The returns for the southern states were limited to counties.
Territories were generally returned by counties and townships.
No additional details concerning the population were collected by the census; however, an act of May 1, 1810, required marshals, secretaries, and assistants to take (under the Secretary of the Treasury), ``an account of the several manufacturing establishments and manufactures within their several districts, territories, and divisions.''
The marshals collected and transmitted these data to the Secretary of the Treasury at the same time as the results of the population enumeration were transmitted to the Secretary of State.
No schedule was prescribed for the collection of industrial data and the nature of the inquiries were at the discretion of the Secretary of the Treasury.
An act of May 16, 1812, provided for the publication of a digest of manufactures containing data on the kind, quality,
10 Carrol D. Wright and William C. Hunt, The History and Growth of the United States Census.

and value of goods manufactured, the number of establishments, and the number of machines of various kinds used in certain classes of manufactures.
The report, containing incomplete returns covering these items for more than 200 kinds of goods and included several items that were principally agricultural, was published in 1813.
The Fourth Census: 1820 The fourth census was taken under the provisions of an act of March 14, 1820.
The enumeration began on the first Monday of August, and was scheduled to conclude within 6 calendar months; however, the time prescribed for completing the enumeration was extended to September 1, 1821.
The 1820 census act required that enumeration should be by an actual inquiry at every dwelling house, or of the head of every family within each district.
As in 1810, the 1820 census attempted to collect industrial statistics.
Data relating to manufactures were collected by the assistants, sent to the marshals, and then transmitted to the Secretary of State at the same time as the population returns.
The report on manufactures presented the data for manufacturing establishments by counties, but the results were not summarized for each district and an aggregate statement was compiled as a result of incomplete returns.
(The poor quality of manufacturing data was blamed partly on insufficient compensation for the collection of the data and the refusal of manufacturers to supply it).
The Fifth Census: 1830 Prior to the passage of the census act authorizing the fifth census in 1830, President Adams, in his fourth address to the U.S. Congress on December 28, 1828, suggested the census commence earlier in the year than August 1.
He also proposed that the collection of age data should be extended from infancy, in intervals of 10 years, to the ``utmost boundaries of life''.
These changes were incorporated into the census act of March 23, 1830.
As in the previous census, the enumeration was made by an actual inquiry by the marshals or assistants at every dwelling house, or, as the law stated, by ``personal'' inquiry of the head of every family, and began on June 1 (instead of the first Monday of August as in previous censuses.)
The assistants were required to transmit their returns to the marshals of their respective districts by December 1, 1830.
Marshals filed these returns and the aggregate counts for their respective districts to the Secretary of State, by February 1, 1831.
However, because of delays in the compilation of the census returns, the filing date was extended to August 1, 1831.
The 1830 census concerned the population only.
No attempt was made to collect additional data on the Nation's manufactures and industry.
The Sixth Census: 1840 The sixth census was governed by the same general provisions of law as in 1830.
Under the provisions of an act of March 3, 1839 (and amended by an act of February 26, 130
1840), the enumeration began on June 1, 1840.
Marshals were to receive two copies of the census receipts from enumerators by November 1, 1840, one of which was to be sent to the Secretary of State by December 1, 1840.
Again, as a result of delays, the deadlines for assistants and marshals were extended to May 1 and June 1, 1841, respectively.
(The January 14, 1841 act extending these deadlines also provided for the re-enumeration of Montgomery County, Maryland, [due to discrepencies in the reports], to begin on June 1, 1841, and to be completed, with receipts returned, by October 1, 1841.)
No population questionnaire was prescribed by the Congress--the design of the questionnaire was left to the discretion of the Secretary of State, and closely followed that used in 1830.
The law did specify the inquiries to be made of each household.
The Seventh Census: 1850 In March 1849, Congress enacted a bill establishing a census board, whose membership consisted of the Secretary of State, the Attorney General, and the Postmaster General.
This board was ``to prepare and cause to be printed such forms and schedules as may be necessary for the full enumeration of the inhabitants of the United States; and also proper forms and schedules for collecting in statistical tables, under proper heads, such information as to mines, agriculture, commerce, manufactures, education, and other topics as will exhibit a full view of the pursuits, industry, education, and resources of the country.''
The Congress also authorized the creation of the Department of the Interior in March 1849, and part of the enabling act provided that the Secretary of the Interior should ``exercise all the supervisory and appellate powers now exercised by the Secretary of State in relation to all acts of marshals and others in taking and returning the census of the United States.''
The seventh census was governed by the provisions of an act of May 23, 1850, which directed that six schedules be used to collect the information requested by the Congress.
The enumeration began on June 1, 1850, and was to be completed, with the results returned to the Secretary of the Interior by November 1, 1850.
The Census Board prepared and printed six schedules for the 1850 census as follows: Â· Schedule No. 1 - Free Inhabitants.
Â· Schedule No. 2 - Slave Inhabitants.
Â· Schedule No. 3 - Mortality.
This schedule collected data-- including name, age, sex, color, and place of birth--on persons having died during the year ending June 1, 1850.
Additional data were collected on constitutional and marital status; profession, occupation, or trade; month of death; disease or cause of death; number of days ill; and any suitable remarks.
Measuring America U.S. Census Bureau
Â· Schedule No. 4 - Production of Agriculture.
This schedule collected data on agricultural production for the year ending June 1, 1850.
Â· Schedule No. 5 - Products of Industry.
This schedule collected data on the products of industry for the year ending June 1, 1850, and applied to all forms of productive industry, including manufactures (except household manufactures), mining, fisheries, and all kinds of mercantile, commercial, and trading businesses.
Â· Schedule No. 6 - Social Statistics.
This schedule collected aggregate statistics for each subdivision enumerated on the following topics: valuation of real estate; annual taxes; colleges, academies, and schools; seasons and crops; libraries; newspapers and periodicals; religion; pauperism; crime; and wages.
Each of these schedules was supplemented by printed instructions in which the intention of each inquiry was explained.
In addition, each assistant was supplied with a ``sample'' schedule that had been completed the way the Census Board had intended.
Each schedule included a space at the head for the entry of the name of the civil division for which the enumeration was made and the date on which the inquiries were completed.
Assistants were required to sign each completed schedule.
Joseph C.G. Kennedy supervised the enumeration and compilation of census data at the end of the 1850 Census.
He served as ``Secretary'' of the Census Board from May 1, 1849 to May 31, 1850, before being appointed Superintendent Clerk, by the Secretary of the Interior.
Kennedy was succeeded as Superintendent Clerk by James D. B. De Bow, on March 18, 1853.
Upon completing the compilation of census results, De Bow resigned the office on December 31, 1854, and the census office was disbanded.
The Eighth Census: 1860 The Eighth Census of the United States was authorized by the previous census May 23, 1850 act.
On the recommendation of the Secretary of the Interior, the provisions of this act were to be ``adhered to, following the requirement for the taking of the eighth, or any subsequent census under its provisions, if no law, therefore, was passed before January 1 of the year in which the census was required.11'' By an act of May 5, 1860, a clerical force was provided for the census office and on June 1, 1860, and Joseph C. G. Kennedy was appointed Superintendent.
The census office, and the position of Superintending Clerk were (for all practical purpose) abolished in May 1862.
A portion of the clerks engaged in census work were transferred to the General Land Office, where the work of the 1860 census was completed, including the publication of a two-volume census report, under the direction of the Commissioner of the General Land Office.
11
The Ninth Census: 1870 The 1870 census commenced on June 1, 1870, and was taken under the provisions of the census act of May 23, 1850.12 The Secretary of Interior appointed General Francis A. Walker Superintendent of the Ninth Census on February 7, 1870.13 Although the 1870 Census was under the 1850 act, a new bill approved on May 6, 1870, made the following changes: Â· The marshals were to submit the returns from ``schedule 1'' (free inhabitants) to the Census Office by September 10, 1870.
All other schedules were to be submitted by October 1, 1870.
Â· The 1850 law authorizing penalties for refusing to reply to the inquiries was expanded to apply to all inquiries made by enumerators.
Redesigned schedules used for 1870 and the omission of a ``slave'' schedule made possible several additional inquiries as follows: Schedule No. 1 - General Population Schedule.
This schedule collected data from the entire population of the United States.
Schedule No. 2 - Mortality.
This schedule collected data on persons who died during the year.
In addition to the 1860 inquiries, inquiries were modified to include Schedule 1's additions to collect data on parentage and to differentiate between Chinese and American Indians.
Inquiries concerning ``free or slave'' status and ``number of days ill'' were discontinued.
Schedule No. 3 - Agriculture.
The 1860 inquiries were used with additional requests for (1) acreage of woodland, (2) production of Spring and Winter wheat, (3) livestock sold for slaughter, (4) total tons of hemp produced, (5) total wages paid, (6) gallons of milk sold, (7) value of forest products, and (8) estimated value of all farm productions.
Schedule No. 4 - Products of Industry.
Using the 1860 schedule as a basis, additional information was requested on (1) motive power and machinery, (2) 12 Although a Congressional committee stated that the 1860 Census had been ``the most complete census that any Nation has ever had,'' it was recognized that the 1850 act was inadequate to meet the changing conditions in which the 1870 Census would need to be conducted.
A special committee of the U.S. House of Representatives (Second Session, Forty-First Congress) investigated and reported on the need for a new census act.
The committee's report was submitted as a bill on January 18, 1870.
This bill was passed by the U.S. House of Representatives, but defeated in the Senate, compelling the use of the 1850 Census act.
13 General Walker was one of several ``experts'' participating in the U.S. House of Representatives' Committee deliberations on the 1870 Census.
Prior to being appointed Superintendent of the Ninth Census, Walker was Chief of the Bureau of Statistics, which then was an agency within the Treasury Department.

hands employed by sex and specified age groups, (3) total annual salaries paid, and (4) time of full- and part-time operation.
Schedule No. 5 - Social Statistics.
The 1860 schedule was modified to incorporate the questions on (1) bonded and other debt of counties, cities, towns, and townships, parishes, and boroughs, (2) pauperism and crime by race (``native black'' and ``native white''); (3) number of church organizations and church buildings; (4) number of teachers and students; (5) kinds of schools, libraries, and taxes, by type.

resources of Alaska, with as much detail as was practical.
An enumeration was made of all untaxed Indians within the jurisdiction of the United States to collect as much information about their condition as possible.
The following five schedules were authorized by the 1880 census act: Schedule No. 1 - Population.
The 1880 schedule was similar to that used previously, with a few exceptions.
Schedule No. 2 - Mortality.
The schedule used the same inquiries as in 1870, and added inquiries to record marital status, birthplace of parents, length of residence in the United States or territory, and name of place where the disease was contracted, if other than place of death.
The Superintendent of Census was authorized to withdraw the mortality schedule in those areas where an official registration of death was maintained, and the required statistics were then collected from these administrative records.
Schedule No. 3 - Agriculture.
In addition to greatly expanded inquiries concerning various crops (including acreage for principal crop), questions were added to collect data on farm tenure, weeks of hired labor, annual cost for fence building and repair, fertilizer purchases, and the number of livestock as of June 1, 1880.
Schedule No. 4 - Social Statistics.
Section 18 of the March 3, 1879, census act made the collection of social statistics the responsibility of experts and special agents, not the enumerators.
Although some data were collected by enumerators using the general population schedule (Schedule No. 1), the majority of the data were collected through correspondence with officials of institutions providing care and treatment of certain members of the population.
Experts and special agents also were employed to collect data on valuation, taxation, and indebtedness; religion; libraries; colleges, academies, and schools; newspapers and periodicals, and wages.
Schedule No. 5 - Relating to Manufactures.
In addition to the inquiries made in 1870, this schedule contained new inquiries as to the greatest number of hands employed at any time during the year, the number of hours in the ordinary work day from May to November and November to May, the average daily wages paid to skilled mechanics and laborers, months of full- and part-time operation, and machinery used.
Special agents were charged with collecting data on specific industries throughout the country, and included the manufactures of iron and steel; cotton, woolen, and worsted goods; silk and silk goods; Measuring America U.S. Census Bureau
The Tenth Census: 1880 The 1880 census was carried out under a law enacted March 3, 1879.
Additional amendments to the law were made on April 20, 1880, and appropriations made on June 16, 1880--16 days after the actual enumeration had begun.
The new census law specifically handed over the supervision of the enumeration to a body of officers, known as supervisors of the census, specifically chosen for the work of the census, and appointed in each state or territory, of which they should be residents before March 1, 1880.
Each supervisor was responsible for recommending the organization of his district for enumeration, choosing enumerators for the district and supervising their work, reviewing and transmitting the returns from the enumerators to the central census office, and overseeing the compensation for enumerators in each district.
Each enumerator was required by law ``to visit personally each dwelling house in his subdivision, and each family therein, and each individual living out of a family in any place of abode, and by inquiry made of the head of such family, or of the member thereof deemed most credible and worthy of trust, or of such individual living out of a family, to obtain each and every item of information and all the particulars.''
In case no one was available at a family's usual place of abode, the enumerator was directed by the law ``to obtain the required information, as nearly as may be practicable, from the family or families, or person or persons, living nearest to such place of abode.''
The 1879 census act also provided for the collection of detailed data on the condition and operation of railroad corporations, incorporated express companies, and telegraph companies, and of life, fire, and marine insurance companies (using Schedule No. 4 - Social Statistics).
In addition, the Superintendent of Census was required to collect and publish statistics of the population, industries, and 132
chemical products and salt; coke and glass; shipbuilding; and all aspects of fisheries and mining, including the production of coal and petroleum.
Interdecennial Censuses of States and Territories: 1885 In addition to the 1880 Census, the 1879 census act also provided for interdecennial censuses by any state or territory, through their duly appointed officers, during the 2 months beginning with the first Monday of June 1885 (State Censuses: An Annotated Bibliography of Census of Population Taken After the Year 1790 by States and Territories of the United States, Prepared by Henry J. Dubester).
The schedules used were to be similar in all respects to those used by the federal census.
Upon completion of a state or territorial census, certified copies of the returns were to be forwarded to the Secretary of the Interior by September 1 of the interdecennial year.
States or territories opting to conduct these censuses were provided 50 percent of the total cost to cover census operations.
As a result, the states of Florida, Nebraska, and Colorado, and the territories of New Mexico and Dakota conducted censuses in 1885.
Copies of the returns were sent to the Department of the Interior, but the data were not published.
The Eleventh Census: 1890 The census of 1890 was taken, under the supervision of Robert P. Porter,14 according to an act of March 1, 1889, and modeled after that used for the 1880 Census.
The enumeration began on June 2, 1890, because June 1 was a Sunday.
The census employed 175 supervisors, with one or more appointed to each state or territory, exclusive of Alaska and Indian territory.
Each subdivision assigned to an enumerator was not to exceed 4,000 inhabitants.
Enumeration was to be completed in cities with populations under 10,000 (according to the 1880 Census results) was to be completed within 2 weeks.
Enumerators were required to collect all the information required by the act by a personal visit to each dwelling and family.
As in 1880, experts and special agents were hired to make special enumerations of manufactures,15 Indians living within the jurisdiction of the United States, and a separate enumeration of Alaska.
Furthermore, the schedule collecting social statistics was withdrawn from enumerators; the work of obtaining statistics concerning mines and mining, fisheries, churches, education, insurance, transportation, and wealth, debt, and taxation, also was conducted by experts and special agents.
14 Robert P. Porter was appointed as Superintendent of Census by the President on April 17, 1889.
He resigned the position on July 31, 1893.
15 In 1890, the manufactures schedules were withdrawn from the general enumeration for 1,042 ``important'' manufacturing centers (opposed to 279 in 1880).
Special agents were responsible for collecting the detailed data in these areas.
Robert B. Porter served as Superintendant of Census until his resignation on July 31, 1893.
On October 3, 1893, Congress enacted a law that directed census-related work to continue under the direction of the Commissioner of Labor.
On March 2, 1895, a further act of Congress closed the census office and transferred the unfinished work to the office of the Secretary of the Interior, where it continued until July 1, 1897.16 The results of the 1890 Census are contained in 25 volumes, plus a three-part compendium, statistical atlas, and an abstract.
The complete results from the special enumeration of survivors of the Civil War were not published (the schedules of which were turned over to the Bureau of Pensions); however, the special inquiry on Schedule 1 (general population schedule) regarding Union and Confederate veterans were published in the report on population.
The Twelfth Census: 1900 The twelfth census of the United States was conducted under the terms of the census act of March 3, 1899, and supervised by the Director of the Census, William R. Merriam.
The enumeration was conducted in each state and organized territory, including Washington, DC, Alaska, Hawaii, and ``Indian Territory.''17 The census was taken as of June 1, 1900, and was to be completed in 2 weeks in places of 8,000 inhabitants or more (as of the 1890 Census) and 1 month in rural districts.
The United States and its territories were divided into 297 supervisors' districts, which were subdivided into 52,726 enumeration districts.
The enumeration of military and naval personnel (within the country and abroad) was conducted through the Departments of War and the Navy.
Similarly, the enumeration of the ``Indian Territory'' was carried out in cooperation with the Commissioner of Indian Affairs.
Large institutions (prisons, hospitals, etc.) were enumerated through the appointment of special ``institution'' enumerators.
Enumerators were much more closely supervised during the 1900 Census.
In large cities, special agents were appointed to assist the census supervisor.
Enumerators used ``street books,'' in which a record of each enumerator's work was made on a daily basis.
Enumerators used individual census slips for obtaining a correct return for any person (particularly lodgers and boarders) absent at the time of the enumerator's visit.
Additionally, ``absent family'' schedules were used for securing a complete record for any person residing within the enumeration district, but temporarily absent.
16 The Commissioner of Labor continued his supervisory role of census-related work until October 5, 1897 (serving since October 1, 1865 without compensation), when upon his request, he was relieved by the Secretary of Interior.
17 Censuses were not conducted until 1890 of Indian Territory.
Alaska's first census was conducted in 1880.
Hawaii was annexed by the United States on August 12, 1898.
Therefore, the 1900 Census was the first census of the islands taken under the supervision of the United States.
The Hawaiian Government, however, did conduct censuses every 6 years, from 1866 to 1896.

The Thirteenth Census: 1910 Under the provisions of the census act of July 2, 1909, the thirteenth census was administered.
In accordance with the provisions of the act, general population and Indian population schedules were prepared.
The schedules used for Hawaii and Puerto Rico, although similar to the general population schedule, differed slightly from those used within the United States.
Census enumerators began canvassing the Nation on April 15, 1910.18 The law gave census takers 2 weeks to complete their work in cities of 5,000 inhabitants or more, while enumerators in smaller and rural areas were allotted 30 days to complete their task.
The Fourteenth Census: 1920 The Fourteenth Census Act of July 2, 1909, provided for the 1920 and subsequent censuses; however, numerous minor changes were sought prior to the census, so a new law was enacted on March 3, 1919.
This act designated a 3-year decennial census period, beginning July 1, 1919.
During this 3-year period, the act provided for an increased work force at the Census Bureau's headquarters in Washington, DC, and for the creation of a special field force to collect census data.
Section 20, of the Fourteenth Census Act, provided that the enumeration of the population should be made as of January 1, 1920.19 Under the direction of the Director of the Census, Samuel L. Rogers, the work of actual enumeration began on January 2, 1920.
The census covered the United States, the outlying possessions (excluding the Philippines and the Virgin Islands, the military, Red Cross, consular services abroad, and the naval service abroad or in American waters, but not on a fixed station.)20 For the country as a whole and for states and political subdivisions within the country, the population enumerated was the resident population.
The enumerators (according to the census law), were instructed to enumerate persons at their ``usual place of abode''--i.e., their permanent home or
regular lodging place.
Persons were not always counted in the places where they happened to be found by the enumerators or where they transacted their daily business.
Persons temporarily absent from their usual places of abode (i.e., on business, traveling, attending school, or in hospitals) were enumerated at the places where they habitually resided and the information for these people was obtained from relatives or acquaintances.
Persons having no fixed place of abode were required by the census law to be enumerated where they slept on the night of January 1, 1920.
The Fifteenth Census: 1930 Under the direction of William M. Steuart, Director of the Census, and in accordance with the Fifteenth Census Act, approved June 18, 1929, ``a census of population, agriculture, irrigation, drainage, distribution, unemployment, and mines [was] taken by the Director of the Census'' on April 1, 1930.
The census encompassed each state and Washington, DC, Alaska, Hawaii, and Puerto Rico.
A census of Guam, Samoa, and the Virgin Islands was taken in the same year by the islands' respective governors, and a census of the Panama Canal Zone was taken by the governor of that area.
In addition to population data, the 1930 census also collected the following statistics: Â· Agriculture.
Acreage of farm; value of land and buildings; mortgage debt; expenditures for labor, feed, and fertilizer; farm machinery and facilities; acreage, yield, and value of crops; quantity and value of livestock.
Â· Manufacturing (with similar data collected from mines and quarries).
Quantity and value of products; the number of salaried employees and wage earners; aggregate payments for salaries and wages; the cost of materials and fuel.
Â· Distribution.
Kind of business; type of operation; net sales; number of employees; total amount paid in salaries and wages; stocks on hand.
Â· Construction.
Data was collected from general contractors, subcontractors, and operative builders regarding value of construction; wage payments; cost of materials; and subcontract work performed or let.
Â· Unemployment.
Data from families and establishments were transferred to punch cards--approximately 300,000,000 in all21-- and were processed by electronic sorting and ``automatic tabulating machine'' at the rate of approximately 400 per minute.
These tabulations provided the raw data necessary for the compilation of statistical tables prepared by clerks and statisticians.22 21 Approximately 125,000,000 punch cards were used to tabulate the data for the population.
Fifteen or more cards were required for each farm, thus, the census of agriculture comprised an additional 150,000,000 cards.

18 The change of ``census day'' from June 1 to April 15 was made upon the suggestion of the Census Bureau.
It was believed that the April 15 date would be more desirable, since a large number of people are away from their homes in June.
19 The date was changed upon the request of the Department of Agriculture and users of agricultural statistics.
The new date had advantages for the agricultural census--the past years work on all farms had been finished, and the new years work had not yet begun.
The majority of farmers would have been occupying the farms they had the previous year, whereas, a few months later, many renters would have moved to other farms.
Furthermore, the birth of livestock increases greatly during the Spring and early Summer.
Therefore, a livestock census referring to January 1, 1920, would be far more valuable than one taken several months later.
20 No provision was made by the Fourteenth Census Act for the enumeration of the Philippines.
Censuses of the Philippines were conducted by the Philippine Commission in 1903.
A second was conducted by the Philippines Government on December 31, 1918 (but called the ``1919 Census'').
A special census of the Virgin Islands was conducted by the United States, November 1, 1917.

1930 Census of Unemployment A Census of Unemployment was conducted, in conjunction with the 1930 census, by an act of May 3, 1928.
This special enumeration collected data on persons who usually worked for wages or a salary, but were not working at the time the census was taken.
William M. Steuart, Director of the Census, said ``the results of the [unemployment] census will furnish a picture of the unemployment situation as indicated not only by the number of unemployed but by the attendant circumstance of unemployment.
It will bring the answer to certain fundamental questions about which nothing definite is known at present.
Obviously, something more than a mere knowledge of the number of persons out of work is needed, if we are to measure fairly and accurately, without exaggeration and without understatement, the gravity of the unemployment situation.
We need the census to know the facts.23'' Enumerators were instructed to complete an unemployment schedule for every person responding ``No'' in column 25 of the general population schedule.
The ``unemployed'' were grouped into two classes--those having a job but temporarily laid-off on account of a lack of orders, weather, sickness, etc.; and those who were unemployed but want to work.
The unemployment census provided data concerning the number of men and women unemployed, the average age of the unemployed, how many of the unemployed were married and single, how long they had been out of work, and the leading reasons for unemployment in the United States.
Data were made available for the Nation, individual segments of the population (i.e., by age, race, marital status, etc.), and for the foreign-born and native populations.
The Sixteenth Census: 1940 The Sixteenth Census of the United States covered the continental United States, Alaska, American Samoa, Guam, Hawaii, the Panama Canal Zone, Puerto Rico, the Virgin Islands of the United States, the military and consular services abroad, and naval services abroad or in American waters, but not at a fixed station.24 Persons in the military services were enumerated as residents of the states, counties, and minor civil divisions in which their posts of duty were located (members of their families were enumerated at the place in which they resided).
The crews of American merchant marine vessels were enumerated as part of the population of the port from which the vessel operated.
23
No apportionment had been done after the 1920 Census-- the 1910 apportionment remained in effect.
Consequently, the 1929 act included provisions that, for the 1930 and subsequent censuses, (unless the Congress, within a specified time enacted legislation providing for apportionment on a different basis) the apportionment should automatically be made by the method last used.
In accordance with this act, a report was submitted by the President to the Congress on December 4, 1930, showing the apportionment computations both by the method of major fractions (which was used in 1910) and by the method of equal proportions.
In 1931, in the absence of additional legislation, the method of major fractions was automatically followed.25 In the application of this method, the Representatives are so assigned that the average population per Representative has the least possible variation as between one state and any other.
As a result, California gained three Representatives between 1930 and 1940 and six other states-- Arizona, Florida, New Mexico, North Carolina, Oregon, and Tennessee--each gained one.
To balance these gains (since the number of Representatives in the House was not changed), nine states lost one Representative each--Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Kansas, Massachusetts, Nebraska, Ohio, Oklahoma, and Pennsylvania.
Four notable changes were made to the 1940 Census, including the addition of the housing schedule, the sampling procedure (both discussed in further detail below), the incorporation of the questions on employment and unemployment onto the general population26 schedule, and inquiries into migration.27 1940 Census of Housing On August 11, 1939, a national census of housing was approved by the Congress, ``to provide information concerning the number, characteristics (including utilities and equipment), and geographic distribution of dwelling structures and dwelling units in the United States.
The Director of the Census shall take a census of housing in each state, the District of Columbia, Hawaii, Puerto Rico, the Virgin Islands, and Alaska, in the year 1940 in conjunction with, and at the same time, and as part of the population inquiry of the sixteenth decennial census.''
The housing inquiries were collected via a separate census, partly because they were added by legislation late in the census planning, and partly because the nature of the questions so differed from those of the census of population.
25 In 1941, this law was amended to the effect that apportionment based on the 1940 and subsequent censuses should be made by the method of equal proportions.
26 These inquiries had been made by special Census of Unemployment in 1930 (See 1930 Unemployment Census).
27 A question was added asking, for each person 5 years old and above, the residence on April 1, 1935.
These data were coded and compared to the place of residence in 1940, thus providing, for the first time, statistics on population movement.

The information collected by the two schedules was collected, however, by the same enumerator, at the same time as those for the population schedule.
Use of Sampling in the 1940 Census.
The 1940 sample was a representative cross-section of the entire population.
Tabulations made from the sample would be as nearly as possible the same as if information concerning every person had been obtained.
The sample enlarged the scope of the census and facilitated tabulations in the following ways: Â· Since the supplementary questions were asked only 1/20th (5-percent sample) as often as they would have in a complete census, the speed of field work was increased and carried out at a reduced cost, thus making it possible to carry more questions on the schedule.
Â· Tabulations based on the sample could be completed months ahead of the regular tabulations prepared from the general population--an especially important feature in times of national emergency and for obtaining quick preliminary counts of the distribution of the labor force by area, sex, age, etc.
Â· The reduced cost of sample tabulations permitted the publication of data that otherwise would not be possible.
Â· Sample cards could be stored for subsequent tabulations not feasible for the entire population as the need arose.
Â· Sampling helped to adapt the census to newly developed needs, and to maintain continuity from one census to another.
Participants were selected for the sample by designating 2 of the 40 lines on each side of the schedule as sample lines and instructing the enumerators to ask the supplementary questions for each person whose name happened to fall on these lines.
This method resulted in a 5-percent sample of all the lines in each geographic area.
The actual percentage of persons drawn from the sample from any district would vary by chance, depending on how the names happened to ``line up'' as the enumerators proceeded with their enumeration.
The Seventeenth Census: 1950 As in 1930 and 1940, the 1950 Census was conducted according to the terms of the Fifteenth Census Act.
The enumeration began on April 1, 1950, with 90 percent of the population having been enumerated by the end of the month (weather delayed enumeration in some areas until mid-May).
All but 1 percent of the population had been enumerated by the end of June 1950.
The 1950 census encompassed the continental United States, the Territories of Alaska and Hawaii, American Samoa, the Canal Zone, Guam, Puerto Rico, the Virgin Islands of the United States, and some of the smaller 136
islands and island groups within the United States' possession.28 The census also made special provisions for the enumeration of American citizens living abroad (and their dependents), including the armed forces of the United States, employees of the United States Government, and the crews of vessels in the American Merchant Marine at sea or in foreign ports.
The census of Americans living abroad was attempted through cooperative arrangements with the Department of Defense, the Department of State, the United States Maritime Administration, and other federal agencies concerned.
These agencies took the responsibility for the distribution and collection of specially designed census questionnaires for individuals and households.
Other persons living abroad were to be reported by their families or neighbors in the United States; however, the quality of these data was considered suspect and they were not included in the published statistics.
Procedures to improve coverage.
Several aids were employed to improve the completeness of the 1950 Census coverage.
The most prominent were as follows: Â· A longer and better planned period of training was provided for enumerators.
Â· Each enumerator was furnished with a map of his enumeration district, showing the boundaries of the area for which they were responsible.
Â· An infant card had to be completed for each baby born after January 1, 1950 (since experience had shown that babies are easily missed).
Â· A crew leader was assigned to supervise each group of approximately 15 enumerators.
The crew leader was responsible for helping enumerators with ``problem cases'' and for spot-checking a sample of the dwelling units assigned to them.
Â· A special enumeration of persons in hotels, tourist courts, and other places where transients usually pay for quarters was made the night of April 11, 1950.
``Missed Person'' forms were published in newspapers at the end of the field canvassing operations so persons who thought they had been missed could complete a form and mail it to the district supervisors.
Â· District supervisors made preliminary announcements of the population counted so that any complaints concerning the completeness of the enumeration could be submitted before the field offices were closed.
If the evidence indicated an appreciable undercount, a re-enumeration of the area was conducted.
28 Although some smaller islands and island groups did not participate in the census, data for their populations were collected from other sources and included in the 1950 census.
Measuring America U.S. Census Bureau
Â· Rates of population change were studied to evaluate the enumeration's completeness.
Â· Vital and immigration statistics were used in conjunction with census data.
(Since the population at a given census should represent the population at the previous census, with additions and subtractions resulting from births, deaths, and immigration, it is possible to calculate the expected population on a given census date and compare the actual total received.)
Following these procedures improved the coverage of the 1950 census over that of the 1940 census.29 (The components of population change were probably estimated more accurately during the 1940s than for the 1930s because not all states were consistently registering births and deaths until 1933.)
Post-Enumeration Survey.
The 1950 census was further checked using a post-enumeration survey, in which a re-enumeration, on a sample basis, was conducted.
The Census Bureau recanvassed a probability sample of about 3,500 small areas and compared these to the original census listings to identify households omitted from the enumeration.
In addition to the check for omitted households, a sample of about 22,000 households was reinterviewed to determine the number of persons omitted in cases where the household had been included.
The Post-Enumeration Survey interviewers were given intensive training and supervision.
Efforts were made to limit respondents to the person who was presumably best informed regarding the information desired, i.e., the person themselves.
These precautions resulted in an expense per case in the Post-Enumeration Survey many times that of the original enumeration, and affordable only on a samplebasis.
The Eighteenth Census: 1960 The 1960 census began on April 1, 1960, in accordance with the requirements of an act of August 31, 1954 (amended August 1957), which codified Title 13 of the United States Code.
By mid-April, 85 percent of the population of the United States had been enumerated with the count up to 98 percent by the end of the month.
Several notable changes were made in the procedures for taking and tabulating the census.
These changes were: 1) the greater use of sampling, 2) the development of procedures enabling most householders an opportunity to consult other members and available records when completing
the questionnaire for their families, and 3) the use of electronic equipment for nearly all data processing work.30 Sampling.
In the 1960 census, a 25-percent sample was used.
The greater use of sampling meant that the totals for some of the smaller areas were subject to a moderate amount of sampling variation, the usefulness of the statistics was not significantly impaired.
Using a 25-percent sample of households eliminated nearly 75 percent of the processing expenses otherwise required for the items in the sample.
Enumeration procedures.
The 1960 enumeration was divided into two stages--the first concentrating on quick coverage of the population and the collection of a few items for every person and dwelling unit, and the second devoted to the collection of the more detailed economic and social information required for sample households and dwelling units.
Both stages used questionnaires left at the residence to be filled out by one or more members of the family.
The enumeration began prior to April 1, 1960, when an advance census form was delivered by the U.S. Postal Service to each household.
The time between delivery of the form and the arrival of an enumerator to collect the household's information allowed the household to assemble information needed to respond to the census inquiries.
Shortly after April 1, 1960, the second stage of the enumeration began.
Enumerators made their rounds to collect the census data and left an additional form--containing the sample inquiries--at every fourth house visited.
Households receiving the sample form were asked to complete the form and mail it to their local census office in the postage-paid envelope provided by the enumerator.
When these mailed questionnaires were received at the census office, Census Bureau personnel checked the sample forms for accuracy and conducted telephone or personal inquiries to complete unanswered inquiries when necessary.
This two-stage enumeration was believed to be advantageous in that, in the past, enumerators were given only brief special training and were burdened with more instructions and work than they could effectively manage.
By creating a two-stage enumeration the field work and training were reduced.
Approximately one-third of the enumerator work force was retained for work in the second stage--receiving additional training that focused solely upon the content of the sample questions.
In specified areas (about 15 percent of the total population, characterized as living in areas of low population density and/or having inferior road networks), the two staged enumeration was combined, so that the enumerator collected and recorded sample data in the same interview in which the 100-percent inquiries were recorded.

The Nineteenth Census: 1970 When planning for the 1970 census, the need for an accurate count of the population was even greater than in the past because of the increasing tendency for governmental bodies to use population as a basis for distributing funds, and the more general awareness by local government officials and others of the potential effects of census undercounts.
Throughout the 1960s, researchers had reported that the population was increasingly resistant to the census.
Studies had shown more alienation and distrust of government, and there appeared to be more organized attempts to protest the census.
Furthermore, undercounts following the 1950 and 1960 censuses were blamed upon the enumerators' failure to follow instructions.
Hence, stress was placed on simplified procedures, training, and quality control.
Analysis of the results of the 1960 evaluation program and studies performed in the 1950s and 1960s indicated that the reasons for the undercounts were more complex.
In particular, a substantial part of the undercount appeared to be due to either deliberate attempts by some segments of the population to be omitted from the census or the fact that they did not fit into any households by the ``conventional rules'' of residence.
Even where the undercount was due to complete households being missed, the causes were frequently such that additional enumerator training produced only marginal gains.
This analysis led to a two-phase approach to coverage for the 1970 census.
The first phase was the use of a basic census methodology that permitted knowledgeable outside sources to have an offer input into the list of housing units established by the census, and provided for automatic checks that enumerators actually completed a questionnaire for all known units.31 This was done in areas containing about 60 percent of the population through the creation of an address register independent of the enumeration phase, correction and updating of the register by U.S. Post Office employees familiar with their routes, and checks by Census Bureau employees to ensure that all housing units on the address register were accounted for when enumerators had completed their assignments.
A self-enumeration questionnaire was used in 1970 (as in 1960 for 60 percent of the population).
Such questionnaires were believed to provide better reporting within households, because they provided respondents uniform census definitions and rules to follow for unusual household residence situations.
In the areas containing the remaining 40 31 Throughout the census history, a small percentage of enumerators completed questionnaires by ``curb stoning.''
Curb stoning meant the enumerator completed questionnaires for an individual or multiple households from the curb, without actually conducting an interview or checking the accuracy of their ``guesses.''
This practice was motivated, in part, by the requirement to meet quotas or payment for work done on a ``piece-of-work'' basis.
percent of the population, more conventional listing procedures were followed, but with self-enumeration features.
The second phase of the 1970 enumeration was to superimpose on the regular census procedures projects specifically designed to increase coverage.
Prior to 1970, studies of the effectiveness of a variety of devices for improving coverage were made, generally as part of large-scale tests conducted during the 1960s, which resulted in several coverage improvement initiatives.
The 1970 coverage improvement program included measures to improve coverage by (1) developing a more favorable public view of the census; (2) increasing the public's understanding of the importance of the census and its confidentiality; and (3) improving the enumerators' performance in hard-to-enumerate areas through intensive training and supervision.
The specific changes made included-- Â· A sharp reduction in the number of questions to be asked of households--the number of inquiries on the questionnaire intended for 3 million households had been reduced from 66 to 23.
Â· Questions on the adequacy of kitchen and bathroom facilities were reworded to remove any implication that the federal government was trying to ascertain with whom these were shared.
Â· The Secretary of Commerce increased his supervision of the census and retained independent experts as census advisors.
Â· A letter accompanied the census questionnaire that explained the need for data requested and emphasized the confidentiality of responses.32 Census questionnaires with instruction sheets were delivered by the U.S. Post Office to every household several days prior to ``Census Day''--April 1, 1970.
In areas with comparatively large populations of Spanish-speaking households, a Spanish-language version of the instruction sheet also was enclosed.
Households either received a short-form questionnaire, which contained questions asked of 100 percent of the population (80 percent of the population received this form), or a long-form questionnaire, sent to 20 percent of the population, containing questions asked of 15 and 5 percent of the population.
In larger metropolitan areas and some adjacent counties (approximately 60 percent of the United States' population), households were asked to complete and return the questionnaire by mail on April 1, 1970 (resulting in an 87 percent mailback response rate), which was then reviewed by an enumerator or census clerk.
Telephone or personal follow-up was made to complete or correct missing, incomplete, or inconsistent questionnaires.

percent of the United States' population, instructions asked that the householder complete the form and hold it for pick up by an enumerator.
The Twentieth Census: 1980 For most of the United States, ``Census Day'' for the 1980 enumeration was April 1, 1980.33 As in past censuses, all questionnaires were to be completed giving information as of that date, regardless of when the form was actually completed.
The 1980 census also included two small surveys--the Components of Inventory Change Survey, which obtained information on counts and characteristics of the housing units that changed or stayed the same between 1973 and 1980; and the Residential Finance Survey, requesting data on mortgages, shelter costs, selected housing characteristics, and owner characteristics.
The use of a mailout/mailback questionnaire in 1970 had proven successful, and eased the follow-up operation burden.
Furthermore, tests during the 1970 census indicated the feasibility of administering a mailout/mailback census in rural areas and small towns.
As a result, the mail census areas for 1980 covered 95.5 percent of the United States population.
Field Enumeration.
The 1980 field enumeration procedures were similar to those used in 1970, with the exception of the greatly expanded use of the mail for questionnaire delivery and return.
Households received a questionnaire in the mail, completed it, and mailed it back to their local census district office.
In those areas enumerated conventionally (i.e., through enumerator visits to the housing unit), the U.S. Postal Service delivered a questionnaire to each household 4 days prior to Census Day.
Respondents were instructed to complete their questionnaires, but hold them until an enumerator visited the household.
The enumerators collected the completed short-form questionnaires or helped the head of the household complete the form at the time of the visit, or completed a long-form questionnaire at designated housing units.
Enumerators also enumerated individuals living in group quarters.
Publicity.
The 1980 census incorporated an extensive advertising and promotion campaign.
The focus of the campaign was to increase public awareness and cooperation with the census, i.e., to encourage households to fill out their census forms, and in mail census areas, mail them back to their census district offices.
The campaign was directed by the Census Bureau's Census Promotion Office (CPO), established in the Summer 1978.
The CPO secured the free services of the Advertising Council in directing the advertising campaign.
The Council, in turn, hired the firm of Ogilvy 
The promotion campaign incorporated media advertising, the distribution of information kits to magazines and newspapers and census promotional kits to over 100,000 schools, and the development of an extensive network of partnerships with corporations and private organizations interested in supporting the census.
In addition, public relations specialists in the Census Bureau's regional and district offices handled a variety of more localized promotional activities, including obtaining time for public service announcements (PSAs) from local broadcast outlets, advising census managers on working with the press, partnering with local companies, and serving as liaisons with complete-count committees (over 4,000 complete count committees were organized throughout the country in an effort to generate local publicity and support for the census).
The Twenty-First Census: 1990 The twenty-first census of the United States was taken as of April 1, 1990.
The census covered the 50 states, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, the Virgin Islands, and the Pacific Island territories (American Samoa, the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands, Guam, and by special agreement, the Republic of Palau.)
The 1990 census used two questionnaires--a short-form containing questions asked of the entire population and a long-form with additional population and housing questions asked of approximately 1-in-6 households.
The content of the 1990 census questionnaire was similar to that for 1980.
The short-form questionnaire for households contained the items to be asked of all persons and for housing units.
Those items--plus the population and housing questions to be asked on a sample basis--appeared on the long-form questionnaire.
For the 1990 census, the Census Bureau introduced the Topologically Integrated Geographic Encoding and Referencing (TIGER) system, which was developed by the Census Bureau and the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS).
The TIGER system documented all streets, roads, rivers, lakes, railroads, and their attributes (names and address ranges, where appropriate), as well as the boundaries, names, and codes of all geographic entities used for data collection and tabulation for the entire United States, Puerto Rico, the Virgin Islands, and the Pacific Island territories.
In addition to supporting the geocoding requirement, the TIGER system also provided a means to produce the many different maps required for data collection and tabulation.

33 ``Census Day'' in northern and western Alaska was January 22, 1980, so the enumeration would be completed prior to the Spring thaw.
As part of an agreement with the local governments, Census Day in the Trust Territory of the Pacific Islands (excluding the commonwealth of Northern Mariana Islands) was September 15, 1980, so teachers could be used as enumerators.

With the mapping capabilities of the TIGER system and the use of a master address list, developed jointly between the Census Bureau and U.S. Postal Service, the Census Bureau mailed pre-addressed short- or long-form questionnaires to approximately 86.2 million households.
The 1990 census questionnaire packages were mailed to households beginning in February 1990.
Most post offices had delivered the initial mailings by March 23, 1990, followed by a mailed reminder card on March 30, 1990.
Occupants were asked to complete these questionnaires and return them by mail.
Nonrespondents to the questionnaire mailout received a personal visit from an enumerator seeking to complete a census questionnaire for the household.
Publicity.
As in 1980, the 1990 census was extensively advertised in television, radio, print, and public advertising.
The goal of this advertising was to encourage mail response, reduce differential undercount, and foster a positive atmosphere within which to take the census convincing people that the census was both important and safe.
Promotion activities included ``complete count'' committees, information kits for schools, churches (the Religious Organizations Project), and the media, workshops, ``pro bono'' PSAs sponsored by the Advertising Council; local government outreach and partnerships; and the Census Education Project (designed to educate students about the census).
Compared to the estimated $38 million worth of free commercial advertising received in 1980, an audit placed the 1990 figure at about $66.5 million.
Local television and radio stations were responsible for 69 percent of that value, followed by 21 percent for ethnic media.
The PSA campaign reached a potential audience of 99 percent of the adultaged population, with an average of 68 exposures to census related advertising per person.
The Twenty-Second Census: 2000 The twenty-second decennial census--Census 2000--enumerated the residents of the United States, Puerto Rico, and the Island Areas, and Federal employees and their dependents living overseas as of Census Day, April 1, 2000.
The majority of these households participated in the census through a mailout/mailback operation.34
In February 2000, the Census Bureau mailed advance letters to each household within the U.S. informing them that a Census 2000 questionnaire would soon be arriving.
The letter also included instructions on how to obtain an in-language questionnaire for non-English speaking households.
Beginning in early March 2000, the U.S. Postal Service began delivering approximately 98 million questionnaires to households throughout the U.S. and its territories.
The majority of households (83 percent) received a short-form questionnaire that asked for information on seven subjects (name, sex, age, relationship, Hispanic origin, and race).35 A sample of 1-in-6 households (17 percent) was selected to receive the long-form questionnaire, which in addition to the short-form questionnaire inquires, also contained 52 questions requesting more detailed information about housing, social, and economic characteristics of the household.
The questionnaire mailout was followed by the mailing of ``reminder cards'' to each household receiving a questionnaire.
In total, 65 percent of households responded to the mailout/mailback census.
The remaining 35 percent of households were visited by enumerators who attempted to complete a questionnaire via personal interviews.
Census 2000 Advertising Campaign.
Census 2000 featured the first ever paid advertising campaign.
So as to reach all adults living in the United States (including Puerto Rico and the Island areas), the Census Bureau awarded a contract to Young 
The advertising campaign consisted of more than 250 TV, radio, print, outdoor, and Internet advertisements--in 17 languages--reaching 99 percent of all U.S. residents.
By the end of the campaign, the census message--``This is your future.
Don't leave it blank.''--had been heard or seen an average of 50 times per person.
At its conclusion the campaign was ranked the second most effective campaign according to an AdTrack--USA TODAY consumer poll and for the first-half of 2000, the Census Bureau ranked 53rd in spending among all advertisers in the United States.
(For additional information on Census 2000 operations, see ``Census 2000 Operational Plan,'' U.S. Department of Commerce, Economics and Statistics Administration, U.S. Census Bureau, December 2000.)
35 For the first time, recipients of the short-form questionnaire had the option of providing their information by submitting electronic responses to the questionnaire via the Internet.
Although this option was not extensively promoted, approximately 66,000 households chose to respond electronically.
Puerto Rico was enumerated using Update/Leave methodology--enumerators personally delivered a questionnaire to each household, after which the household completed the questionnaire and mailed it back to the Census Bureau.
