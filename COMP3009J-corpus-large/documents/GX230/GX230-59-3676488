RBS Service Report 22
Preface This directory contains a listing, by State, of more than 400 farmer-owned marketing, farm supply, service, and bargaining cooperatives.
Where applicable, the e-mail and/or internet home page address was included.
Cooperatives are classified according to type, and are mostly marketing, farm supply, service, bargaining, or a combination.
Marketing cooperatives are those that assemble and market commodities produced mostly by their farmer-members.
Fishery cooperatives are also included.
Marketing cooperatives may or may not engage in processing.
Farm supply cooperatives purchase and/or manufacture farm supplies for distribution, mostly to farmer-members.
Service cooperatives perform a range of farm production- and managementrelated services, such as ginning, grove care, agronomic services, financial and management consulting, artificial insemination and herd management, transportation and storage.
Bargaining cooperatives negotiate price, quality, and delivery terms with buyers on behalf of their members.
They typically do not take title to commodities.
The directory also includes an alphabetical index of cooperatives and a listing of State councils or associations of cooperatives.
The authors extend their appreciation to the cooperatives that provided the information necessary for updating this report.
We urge readers to advise us of changes as they occur so the directory can be updated in a timely manner.
