Shoreline Plants and Landscaping A SERIES OF WATER QUALITY FACT SHEETS FOR RESIDENTIAL AREAS W isconsin's lakes and streams offer an escape for residents and visitors alike.
From northwoods flowages to southeastern glacial lakes laced throughout the state, our waters provide abundant recreational opportunities, as well as a chance to simply get away from the sights and sounds of an urbanizing society.
The escape has become so popular that many lakeshores and streambanks are now growing more houses than trees, often with more consequences than meet the eye.
Soil exposed during construction can wash into the water, and the development itself permanently alters a portion of the natural landscape.
Buildings and access drives replace vegetation, increasing the amount of storm water runoff and pollutants entering the lake or stream.
Owners of the new home often bring with them traditional landscaping ideas centered on the conventional yard.
Too often that means manicured lawns extending to the water's edge, along with the fertilizer and pesticide applications that are the norm in the cities and villages left behind.
Over time, and combined with other sources of pollution, shoreline development can have profound impacts on water quality.
The impacts can be minimized, however, with a landscaping plan that places less emphasis on lawns and incorporates a variety of plants adapted to conditions near the water's edge.
This publication offers suggestions for getting started, and an extensive list of landscape plants suited for Wisconsin's streambanks and lakeshores.
By following the practical suggestions offered inside, you can improve your property and contribute to the quality of our environment.
BEFORE 
G
rass planted to the water's edge (top illustration) is seldom the best choice, from either an esthetic or water quality standpoint.
Why not try an alternative (bottom illustration)? Substituting a variety of plants for at least parts of the lawn has numerous advantages:
Screens undesirable views while framing good ones.
Helps filter pollutants that wash off roofs, driveways and other hard surfaces.
Reduces the time spent on lawn maintenance and reliance on fertilizers and other lawn chemicals.
BEFORE
Preserves the natural appearance of the shoreline.
Offers better protection against shoreline erosion and requires less formal repair.
Provides increased diversity and improved habitat for wildlife.

GETTING STARTED Â­ LANDSCAPING AND PLANT SELECTION Protecting the Water During Construction With development comes bare soil, but careful planning can minimize erosion and the resulting water quality problems.
Â· The further the construction site is from the lake or stream and the less ground that is disturbed, the better for water quality.
Greater setbacks from the water can also help overcome site limitations such as wet soils or steep slopes.
Â· Indiscriminate removal of trees during construction promotes soil erosion and is also a questionable practice from the standpoint of property values.
A better alternative is to carefully trim trees to frame views of the lake and screen undesirable views.
Â· During construction, use filter fabric fences or straw bales as temporary sediment barriers along the shoreline.
Â· Immediately after construction of any soil-disturbing activity, the soil should be seeded, sodded or planted to natural vegetation and mulched.
Once established, the vegetation becomes a permanent sediment filter.
A fact sheet on Lawn Establishment (A3434) is available from county UW-Extension offices.
Landscaping for Established Yards Proper landscape design and selection of plant material can greatly reduce the effects of shoreline development on water quality.
Lawns groomed right up to the water's edge can be redesigned to allow a buffer zone along the lake or stream.
Banks can be planted to stabilize the soil and eliminate lawn mowing and fertilizing.
Treatments can vary from low-cost, limited alterations to moderate-cost, significant changes.
The specific treatment chose depends on the site and desires of the property owner, but here are a few basics: Â· Leaving a 35-foot (or wider) buffer of unmowed turf along shorelines is the first step in reducing runoff of soil, fertilizer and pesticides.
The grasses will grow 12-24" tall before going to seed.
Mow the buffer zone's inland edge along a natural-looking curve.
Also, use a smooth-flowing curve when mowing pathways through the buffer zone to the water's edge.
Â· Planting appropriate bulbs, perennial flowers, and groundcovers in the grasses of a buffer zone will add seasonal diversity.
Working up small areas and mulching around new plantings will reduce competition from the grasses and reduce runoff of rainfall or melting snow.
Â· Native plants are best adapted to Wisconsin's climate and blend in well with the natural shoreline landscape.
Â· Planted through the grass in the buffer zone, native flowers can provide an ever-changing foreground to the view of the water.
The buffer zone can be planted to native shore plants and prairie by gradually working up small areas (to reduce potential erosion) and seeding or transplanting shallow water plants or wet prairie grasses and forbs.
UW-Extension's Prairie Primer (G2736) provides prairie restoration and maintenance details.
Over time, the native plants will spread, filling in the buffer zone with drifts of color.
Â· Although the view toward the water is often pleasing, there may be visual elements that are unappealing.
The noise of lake activities may also be disruptive.
Trees and shrubs in the buffer zone can frame good views, screen poor views, and reduce sounds.
Incorporating trees and shrubs in mulched planting beds reduces runoff, improves moisture/temperature conditions and provides a natural appearance.
Gradually the whole shoreline can be planted to create a woodland setting with openings for visual and physical access to the water.

LANDSCAPE PLANT HARDINESS ZONES: When selecting shoreline landscape plants from the list that follows, be sure they are identified as hardy for your area.
While some plants may survive in a sheltered spot north of their recommended zone, it is usually best to plant reliable hardy species.

T
he list of plants on the following pages includes most of the better ornamental plant species and cultivars (cultivated varieties) that are usually available for sale in Wisconsin.
The list includes the botanical and common names of recommended plants, growth rate (F = fast, M = medium, S = slow), hardiness zone and plant characteristics.
When selecting plants, please keep the following points in mind:
Wisconsin is divided into six zones based on minimum winter temperatures.
(See map on previous page.)
Always try to select plants that are hardy in your area.
Be sure to review all the plant characteristics before you select trees, shrubs and ground covers for your situation.
Many plants are sensitive to poorly drained soil conditions.
Use only species tolerant of poor drainage in low, wet spots.
Where shade is indicated as one of the plant characteristics, it refers to tolerance, not a requirement for shade.
When selecting plants, one often tends to consider the flower display first.
However, it is also important to consider the year-round interest the plant will provide in the landscape.
Remember that a flower display often lasts only a week or two, while other interesting features such as the bark or fruits may be noticeable for several months.
Where the list includes no mention of flowers, fruits, fall color or other characteristics, those features are insignificant.
An asterisk (*) after a plant's botanical name denotes a species native to Wisconsin.
Most of the plants listed are available at local nurseries.
If the plant you desire is not available, the nursery dealer should be able to tell you where it can be obtained.
These concepts also apply to landscape plants away from the shoreline.
Refer to Extension publication A2865, A Guide to Selecting Landscape Plants for Wisconsin.

A FEW FINAL THOUGHTS Some factors affecting shoreline development are beyond an individual's control.
The property may have been developed and landscaped long ago; zoning code requirements may offer little flexibility for preserving vegetation on the lot; or options may be limited by surrounding properties.
However, there are probably some shoreline landscaping or plant selection tips described inside that can improve both your property and water quality.
If you are proceeding with plans and permits to build, proper construction site practices are summarized in the fact sheet, Erosion Control for Home Builders (GWQ001), available in county UW-Extension offices.
Remember, most Wisconsin lakeshores started out being wooded, and such lots today are the ones often commanding high selling prices.
If you want to maintain some conventional lawn away from the shoreline, refer to other facts sheets in the Yard Care and the Environment series for management suggestions.
If you have any questions about the suitability of a particular plant for your landscaping situation, contact your county UW-Extension office or a local nursery.
