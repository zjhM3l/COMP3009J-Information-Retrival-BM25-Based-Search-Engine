Capitol Holidays News 
The annual holiday lighting ceremony on December 6, immediately following the Big Jingle Jubilee Holiday Parade, officially starts the state's holiday season.
In preparation for this sixty-five year old tradition, many plans are in place to make this celebration at the Capitol exciting for you and your family.
Bringing in the New...
New features of the Capitol decorations include a poinsettia tree, placed in the first floor rotunda, new ribbon and garland throughout the building and new ornaments for the magnificent rotunda tree.
This year's tree, a live eastern red cedar donated by Mr. and Mrs. Bob Staton of Belleville, is approximately 20 feet tall and 12 feet in diameter.
New holiday tree ornaments, representing landmarks from Arkansas's 75 counties and handpainted by artists from the Cox Creative Center in Little Rock, adorn this spectacular tree.
At the official tree-trimming ceremony, scheduled for December 4 at 4 p.m., Secretary Daniels will join county representatives, artists and special guests in featuring the county ornaments on the tree.
These ornaments will be a focal point for the rotunda tree for many years to come.
Other new activities include a winter wonderland scene perfect for those family photos on the first floor of the Capitol and a performance at the December 6 lighting ceremony by the Arkansas Arts Center Tell a Tale Troupe. ...While Keeping the Old Favorites Many of the traditional favorites of the season will again make an appearance this year.
Once again, the Capitol will be ablaze with thousands of lights outlining the building.
The downtown Little Rock Christmas Parade will end at the Capitol, with the lighting ceremony immediately following the parade on December 6.
This year, the George Jernigan tree, a live cedar tree located on the front lawn of the Capitol, will once again serve as the state's official tree and will be decorated with hundreds of lights.
Secretary of State George Jernigan planted the tree in 1976 as the state's official holiday tree.
Of course, the season's most famous celebrity will make an appearance at the lighting ceremony to greet the children and find out who's been naughty or nice.

County Ornaments Debut on Rotunda Tree A new holiday tradition will make its debut at the State Capitol this year.
Seventy-five hand-painted ornaments, each celebrating an Arkansas county, will grace the holiday tree in the Capitol rotunda.
The large gold ornaments feature painted symbols of each county chosen by individual county representatives.
Placed together on the tree, the ornaments, featuring local landmarks, courthouses and various industries, represent not just the individual counties, but Arkansas as a whole.
"These beautiful ornaments provide a new tradition for families to enjoy and a way for visitors to learn more about the diversity of our state," said Secretary Daniels.
Arkansas artists from the Cox Creative Center decorated the 75 ornaments with the chosen symbol.
Artists providing their talents to create the ornaments were; Annette Kagy, Theda Scribner, Faye Rainwater, Jean Pennucci, Mary Rush, JoAn Knott, Arlette Miller, Judy Honey, David E. Coulter, Shirley Homsley and Sandy Felton.
The county judges, artists and members of the public are invited as special guests to the Tree-Trimming Ceremony, December 4th, 4:00 p.m. in the second floor rotunda of the state Capitol.
We hope you will come join us as we begin a new tradition for the holiday season! 2

Capitol Holidays Holiday Decorations at the Capitol: A long-burning tradition This winter marks the sixty-fifth anniversary of the Arkansas Capitol's first holiday illumination.
Secretary of State C. G. "Crip" Hall established the tradition of decorating the state's Capitol in honor of Christmas in the late 1930s.
Soon after taking office in January 1937, Hall began the process of "brightening up" the Capitol and its grounds.
His goal, he stated, was to "make the Capitol a showplace."
In the following year, Hall made good on his promise in time for the Christmas holiday.
On December 18, 1938, the Capitol's dome and central pediment came ablaze with the light of 1,000 red and blue electric bulbs.
Just above the Capitol Avenue steps, Hall placed a 25-foot evergreen on a turntable, its branches painted silver and illuminated by blue lights.
That same year Hall hosted a Christmas party for disabled and ill children from the nearby Arkansas Children's Home and Hospital.
As Santa Claus looked on, Hall helped distribute toys and games and other gifts donated by state employees.
Response was swift and overwhelmingly positive.
With public opinion behind him, Hall continued to decorate the Capitol for the Christmas season during his twenty-four years in office.
In 1939, the Capitol's lights and fir tree (placed just in front of the bronze doors) were lit on the evening of the 11th.
In 1940, a cedar tree was decorated on the east lawn.
In 1941, a paper-mÃ¢chÃ© Nativity scene was set up on the east plaza, the first incarnation of what would become ever more elaborate displays in years to come.
During the years of WWII, decorations were scaled back due to wartime materials restrictions.
The Capitol's holiday exterior remained dark until December 1945, when the multicolored dome lights, revolving tree and elaborate Nativity scene returned.
As the years passed, more lights were added.
In 1938, perhaps 1,000 lamps burned on the Capitol dome; by 1946, the figure had grown to over 4,000.
In post-war years the tradition evolved into the Capitol's lighting ceremony capping the Little Rock Christmas parade, and the celebration's fame even spread nationwide.
In 1954, a radio audience of perhaps 10 million heard the National Broadcasting Company's broadcast of "Christmas In 3
Arkansas" on 806 of its affiliated stations.
Tradition and affection for the ceremony proved to be effective preservatives.
After Hall's death in 1961, his successors have continued the Capitol's decoration, making adjustments for changing times and practical matters.
Nativity figures were updated from paper-mÃ¢chÃ© to more realistic rubber composition and finally to a hand carved catalpa wood nativity scene, the bright lights outlining the Capitol dome and walls returned, while other elements of the Capitol's holiday dÃ©cor were updated.
The "disco dome" made a brief appearance in 1987.
During the 1990s, the Capitol's holiday decorations continued their evolution.
By the mid-1990s, the privately-funded Nativity scene was relocated from the Capitol's east steps to a peaceful and more naturalistic setting on the building's North Mall.
Local businessman Jennings Osborne garnered much fame and some complaints during the late 1980s and early 90s from his extensive outdoor holiday decorations.
Ordered by the courts to scale back his home decorations, Osborne turned his attention to providing holiday lighting displays throughout Arkansas for cities and attractions, including the Capitol.
Osborne decked the Capitol with hundreds of thousands of lights from 1995 to 2002.
Along with these lights came more secular elements, including annual visits from Disneyland characters.
For 2003, the Capitol's decorations will evoke a more traditional look similar to those of earlier decades.
Ever changing, but remaining familiar, the holiday celebration at the Capitol continues as a beloved tradition and reminder of Secretary of State Hall's vision for the Capitol to be a showplace, especially during the holidays.
