Standards for USGS and USDA Forest Service Single Edition Quadrangle Maps Part 1: Template Development and Use 1.
TEMPLATE DEVELOPMENT AND USE The single edition feature templates were derived from the Standards for 1:24,000-Scale Digital Line Graphs and Quadrangle Maps.
Information about attribute coding was either eliminated or rewritten to make it more appropriate for use as a graphic standard.
This part of the standard explains the format, content, and use of the single edition feature templates.
See appendix 1-A for instructions on how to use the feature templates during revision.
The following sections explain what is included under each heading in the templates and any global rules that apply throughout the templates.
If a rule applies to all of the features, it is considered a global rule.
For example, the rule for how to measure a feature to determine if it meets the minimum size for depiction is a global rule.
The templates contain exceptions to the global rules or additional information that is unique to the feature.
If nothing appears in the template to change a global rule, then the rule applies.
Throughout the templates, if something being described meets the definition and depiction conditions for a feature, the feature name appears in upper case letters; for example, "BRIDGE".
Generic names appear in lower case letters to indicate that they may not meet the definition or depiction conditions for that feature.
If there is no applicable information under a heading, it is indicated by "N/A".

The feature templates are as concise and positive as possible.
Each template is meant to stand alone.
Therefore, the definitions and characteristics describe what a feature is and what its characteristics are, rather than what it is not or what its characteristics are not.
Similarly, the depiction conditions explain when to show a feature, rather than when not to show it.
The different characteristics are grouped together by feature, rather than having a separate feature template for each characteristic.
If this approach had not been used, the feature templates would have been much longer and more cumbersome.
1.1.1 Feature Definitions The feature definitions determine what a feature is.
The main goal of the feature definitions is to identify the features so that the distinctions between them are clear.
The features and their definitions were developed by studying a variety of sources including: National Mapping Program documentation; the Defense Mapping Agency's (now the National Imagery and Mapping Agency) Feature and Attribute Coding System; the Geographic Names Information System feature classes; the Spatial Data Transfer Standard feature list; publications from other Federal agencies, including the USDA Forest Service, the National Ocean Service, the Bureau of Land Management, and the Fish and Wildlife Service; and the Canadian National Topographic Data Base feature list.
Attempts were made to coordinate feature definitions with other organizations.
In some cases this was difficult because 5/03 Draft for Implementation 1-2
Standards for USGS and USDA Forest Service Single Edition Quadrangle Maps Part 1: Template Development and Use feature selection was somewhat different from one agency to another and even between units within each agency.
The feature definitions describe the nature or essential qualities that distinguish one feature from another.
For example, the difference between a stream or river and a canal or ditch may not be obvious to a casual observer.
However, the difference between the two features can be determined by comparing the definitions of STREAM/RIVER and CANAL/DITCH.
Although a CANAL/DITCH are both linear water bodies, STREAM/RIVER and a the definition for
CANAL/DITCH specifies that it is artificial and that it is used to transport water, to drain or irrigate land, to connect two or more water bodies, or to serve as a waterway for water craft.
Therefore, a CANAL/DITCH is distinguished from a STREAM/RIVER by (1) the fact that it is artificial, and (2) the fact that it has specific uses.
If the feature in question does not meet these two criteria, it should not considered a CANAL/DITCH.
Although the feature definitions describe the qualities of features that are used to distinguish one feature from another, the templates do not necessarily specify how to make the distinction between the qualities themselves.
How one goes about deciding if something is artificial or natural, or if it has some special use or not, is beyond the scope of these templates.
There are some cases where the distinction between features is not clear, usually because past practices are not compatible with the classification method that was used to develop the domain of features in this standard.
There are also cases where the definition is clear, but again, because of past practices, there may be some ambiguity.
For example, the definition of a LAKE/POND states that it is a "body of standing water", so a dry lake does not fit the definition of a LAKE/POND.
However, the symbol books list dry lakes along with other lakes and ponds.
In cases like this, rules have been developed in the Source Interpretation Guidelines to reinforce the definition.
The rule in this example is: "Do not depict dry lakes as LAKE/PONDS.
See PLAYA."

Standards for USGS and USDA Forest Service Single Edition Quadrangle Maps Part 1: Template Development and Use 1.1.2 Characteristics Characteristics distinguish between the character or peculiar qualities of a feature.
Many of these characteristics fall into one of three groups: (1) the function or purpose of the feature; (2) the form or nature of the feature; and (3) the state or existence of the feature (or characteristic).
The definitions for the characteristics are generic.
For instance,
the definition for "intermittent" is the same, regardless of what hydrographic feature it is applied to.
In some cases, more than one characteristic may apply to a feature.
The ability to distinguish multiple characteristics of features helps to keep the number of feature templates to a minimum.
For example, a MINE can be a "pit" with a product of "gravel" which distinguishes it from a MINE that is a "quarry" with an unspecified product, without having to create extra feature templates to accommodate every possible combination of characteristics.
For most features, there is a discrete list of appropriate characteristics.
However, for a few features, such as RESERVATION, the number of potential descriptors is quite large and it is not possible to create an exhaustive list of characteristics.
In the case of RESERVATION, the "name" characteristic provides the necessary flexibility to distinguish between the different types of RESERVATIONS.
In this standard, the characteristic "name" refers to the "proper name" of the feature, rather than any generic label that may be applicable.
If the name is always shown the following statement is used: Show the names of FEATURES.
If the name is shown only when it is known the following statement is used: Show the names of FEATURES if they are known.
5/03

Standards for USGS and USDA Forest Service Single Edition Quadrangle Maps Part 1: Template Development and Use The global characteristic "unspecified" can apply to any
characteristic.
"Unspecified" is used when a characteristic exists, but it is not necessary for it to be known to show the feature.
For example, a spring can be shown on a map characteristic of the water is unspecified.
even though the
The global characteristic "general case" applies only to features themselves, rather than to characteristics.
For instance, there are four water pipelines than can be shown: aqueducts, general case pipelines, penstocks, and siphons.
Aqueducts, penstocks, and siphons all have specific uses; however, a general case water pipeline does not have any specific designated use, beyond the fact that it is a water pipeline.
See appendix 1-B for a crosswalk between characteristics and the feature template/themes.
1.1.3 Delineation The delineation guidelines describe the limits of features which, in turn, help to determine if a feature meets the minimum size for depiction and where to position labels, when appropriate.
These guidelines generally describe real world entities, rather than the way the feature is represented on the source or the new map being prepared.
1.1.4 Depiction Conditions The depiction conditions specify which features should be shown.
Added features must meet the depiction conditions for those features.
In general, previously mapped features are retained unless they positively no longer exist.
(See section 1.1.5.2 for exceptions that are noted in the templates.)
Depiction conditions are generally independent of the source, although some information on feature depiction that pertains to specific sources can be found in the Source Interpretation Guidelines.
The depiction conditions reflect the National Mapping Program's policy of cartographic representation, which restricts data content and position based on graphic limitations of scale and legibility.
Only the content that can be displayed on the printed map is shown, including all offsets in position that are necessary to accommodate 5/03 Draft for Implementation 1-5 the feature/
Standards for USGS and USDA Forest Service Single Edition Quadrangle Maps Part 1: Template Development and Use symbolization.
See section 1.1.6 for information on symbolization.
The templates must contain the criteria necessary to ensure that maps are accurate and consistent in style and content.
Therefore, the depiction conditions present the requirements for map content, as well as the step-by-step decisions that are needed to determine whether or not to show a particular feature.
An "If...Then" format is used for the depiction conditions.
format is as follows: If a FEATURE is CONDITION, Then show.
Some features are shown by symbol and label, some are shown by either symbol or label (but not both), while other features are named but symbolized by another feature.
The phrase "Then show" is used when there is at least one limiting condition and the feature has its own symbol.
The phrase "Then show the name" is used when there is a limiting condition that the feature must be named and the feature has no symbol of its own.
The phrase "Show all" is used when there are no limiting conditions for depicting the feature.
When there are multiple depiction conditions, each statement stands alone.
If the feature meets one of the conditions, then it should be shown.
The
The depiction conditions based on minimum sizes are given in inches and in real world dimensions at 1:24,000 scale.
In general, measure features along the longest axis (length) and/or the shortest axis (width).
Measure square features along either axis, measure round features along the diameter, and measure irregular features against the axis of the best fitting non-oriented rectangle.
Measure the length of linear features along the centerline of the feature and measure their width perpendicular to the centerline.
Any specific or unique requirements for measurement are addressed separately for each feature.
For areal measurements, the depiction conditions are expressed as "X square inches".
Therefore, square inches indicate that the value 5/03 Draft for Implementation 1-6
Standards for USGS and USDA Forest Service Single Edition Quadrangle Maps Part 1: Template Development and Use is an areal value .
Thus, 4 square inches indicates an areal
equivalent in extent to a square which measures 2 inches by 2 inches, or to a rectangle which measures 1 inch by 4 inches.
Two examples of an area equal to 4 square inches are: 2" 2" 4" 1"
Decimal values are 0.01 square inches which measures 0.1 0.01 square inches
handled in the same way; an area described as indicates an area equivalent in size to a square inch by 0.1 inch.
An example of an area equal to is: 0.1" 0.1"
Do not confuse this terminology with phrases such as "2 foot square," where neither the value nor the unit is areal. example, an area that is 2 foot square is: 2 ft. 2 ft.
For
The areal value terminology is used in the templates because it allows an area to be defined independently of lengths and widths.
If there are also minimum length or width requirements, then these values are included in the depiction conditions along with the areal value.
For example: If a LAKE/POND is $ 0.025" (50 feet at 1:24,000 scale) along the shortest axis and is $ 0.0025 square inches (10,000 square feet at 1:24,000 scale), Then show.

Standards for USGS and USDA Forest Service Single Edition Quadrangle Maps Part 1: Template Development and Use The term "landmark" is used in the depiction conditions to refer to features that are culturally or physically distinctive in relation to surrounding features.
Their representation provides identifiable ground positions and improves the usefulness of the map.
1.1.5 Source Interpretation Guidelines The source interpretation guidelines provide information for interpreting the depiction specifications when using specific source materials.
They also contain any modifications to the depiction conditions specific to the source materials.
1.1.5.1 All The source interpretation guidelines in this section provide information on how to interpret the depiction specifications, regardless of the source.
Included are such things as when to show a coincident feature based on the depiction conditions, when to show more than one instance of the feature, when to show something as a different feature, how to select which features to show when there are several of the same features closely spaced together, and which theme a feature should be depicted in when a feature can occur in more than one theme.
1.1.5.2 Graphic The source interpretation guidelines in this section provide information on how to interpret the depiction specifications when the source is a map.
Most previously mapped features should be retained unless they positively no longer exist.
However, in some cases previously mapped features must meet current depiction conditions in order to be shown on the new map; for examples of statements pertaining to these features, see the Graphic sections for AREA TO BE SUBMERGED, FORESHORE, and WASH in the Hydrography theme.
There are also a number of offshore features shown on previously published maps prior to 1961 that are no longer required and should not be shown on revised maps for consistency reasons.
For examples of statements pertaining to these features, see the Graphic sections for HAZARD ZONE, POST, ROCK, and SNAG/STUMP in the Hydrography theme.
5/03 Draft for Implementation 1-8
Standards for USGS and USDA Forest Service Single Edition Quadrangle Maps Part 1: Template Development and Use Instructions are also given on how to depict features that were not symbolized on previously published maps because they were coincident with other features.
For example, the feature SURVEY LINE (Public Land Survey System theme) contains the following statement: PLSS lines may not have been shown on previously published maps because they were coincident with other features.
If the feature they were coincident with is deleted, restore the SURVEY LINE as originally surveyed.
1.1.6 Symbolization Feature symbolization is determined by the characteristics and dimensionality of the feature.
A crosswalk between the feature characteristics, symbols, and labels is presented in tabular form in this section.
1.1.6.1 Characteristics Column This column lists only those characteristics that affect symbolization.
If there is no applicable characteristic, this is indicated by "N/A".
Symbol Column This column lists the number of the symbol to use, as determined by the characteristics.

The information about attribute coding was either eliminated or rewritten to make it more suitable and understandable for use as a graphic standard.
The single edition feature templates were reviewed by the USGS and USDA Forest Service to ensure that they contain consistent, concise, unambiguous instructions that describe what to show on single edition maps.
The single edition feature templates provide the following information: Feature Definitions - a definition of the qualities that distinguish one feature from another Characteristics - a listing and definition of the characteristics that distinguish between the peculiar qualities of a feature Delineation - a description of the extent of a feature Depiction Conditions - the criteria a feature must meet to be shown on the map Source Interpretation Guidelines-All - instructions on how to interpret the depiction specifications, regardless of the source Source Interpretation Guidelines-Graphic instructions on how to

Standards for USGS and USDA Forest Service Single Edition Quadrangle Maps Part 1: Template Development and Use Appendix 1-A: Instructions for Using the Feature Templates During Revision "
Use the depiction conditions and the source interpretation guidelines to determine if the feature should be shown.
"
Use the characteristics to determine how the feature should be shown.
For example, a small standing (as opposed to flowing) water body appears in the imagery.
It is probably a LAKE/POND or a RESERVOIR (see Hydrography theme for both).
It appears to have a natural shoreline and it does not have a geometric shape, so it is not a constructed basin.
Based on the feature definition and the source interpretation guidelines, it is a LAKE/POND and not a RESERVOIR.
Use the delineation guidelines to determine the extent of the LAKE/POND.
It is
naturally formed and appears to be perennial, so based on the delineation guidelines and the characteristics, the edge of the LAKE/POND is the position of the shoreline when the water is at the stage that prevails for the greater part of the year (average water elevation.)
Use the depiction conditions to determine if this feature should be shown.
In this example, the State is South Carolina, which is not an arid area.
At average water elevation, the LAKE/POND is approximately 90 feet along the shortest axis and about 20,000 square feet in area.
The depiction conditions require that a LAKE/POND must be $ 0.025" (50 feet at 1:24,000 scale) along the shortest axis and $ 0.0025 square inches (10,000 square feet at 1:24,000 scale) in order to be shown.
The example above meets the depiction criteria, so it should be shown.
After the LAKE/POND is identified, delineated, and the decision to show it is made, the characteristic having to do with the portion of the year the feature contains water (intermittent vs. perennial) determines the proper symbolization to be used.
According to the source interpretation guidelines, the symbolization of the perimeter of the LAKE/POND is determined by the depiction specifications for SHORELINE, DAM/WEIR, NONEARTHEN SHORE, or SPILLWAY.
Symbol specifications are presented in the Standards for 1:24,000- and 1:25,000-Scale Quadrangle Maps, Part 5: Publication Symbols.
If necessary, use the crosswalk table to locate the Part 5 symbol.
The feature characteristics also determine how or whether the LAKE/POND is labeled, because there may be an elevation, proper name, or a water characteristic of "salt" associated with it.
Specifications for names and labels are shown on the style sheets in appendixes 2-C and 2-D in the Standards for 5/03 Draft for Implementation
1A-3
Standards for USGS and USDA Forest Service Single Edition Quadrangle Maps Part 1: Template Development and Use Appendix 1-A: Instructions for Using the Feature Templates During Revision Revised Primary Series Quadrangle Maps.
The characteristics of LAKE/POND in the feature templates indicate that the value for the elevation is required only if it is known.
According to the characteristics, the name of the LAKE/POND is shown, if it is known.
The Standards for Revised Primary Series Quadrangle Maps indicate that new names can be added to maps, if supported by Geographic Names Information System sources, although normally the only new names that are added are those that are identified during boundary update.
The feature template for LAKE/POND indicates that the distinctive characteristic of the water is identified only if the lake is known to be "salty".
Since there is no evidence from the imagery or from an ancillary source that the lake is "salty", a label describing the water characteristic is not necessary.
Summary The following is a summary of the revision procedure: 1.
