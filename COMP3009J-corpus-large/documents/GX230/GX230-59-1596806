NASS Monthly Agricultural Newsletter The following estimates, forecasts, and projections are mainly taken from recent publications of the National Agricultural Statistics Service, Economic Research Service, and the World Agricultural Outlook Board of the USDA.
Wheat - All wheat production totaled 1.62 billion bushels in 2002, down 4% from the last forecast and 17% below 2001.
This is the lowest production since 1972.
Grain area harvested is 46.0 million acres, down 5% from last year and the smallest area harvested since 1970.
The U.S. yield is 35.3 bushels per acre, down 0.1 bushel from the last forecast and down 4.9 bushels from last season.
The World Agricultural Outlook Board (WAOB) projected 2002/03 ending stocks are down 36 million bushels from last month as reduced production more than offset smaller use.
A market year average price between $3.55 and $3.95 per bushel is expected, compared to $2.78 for the 2001 crop.
Corn - The October forecast for 2002 corn production is 8.97 billion bushels, up 1% from the last forecast but down 6% from last year.
Based on October 1 conditions, yields are expected to average 127.2 bushels per acre, up 1.8 bushels from last month but down 11.0 bushels from a year ago.
If realized, this would be the lowest production since 1995.
WAOB projected U.S. ending stocks are up 35 million bushels from last month as the higher production more than offsets increased use and reduced beginning stocks.
A market year average price between $2.30 and $2.70 per bushel is expected, compared to $1.97 for the 2001 crop.
Soybeans - The 2002 soybean crop is forecast at 2.65 billion bushels, virtually unchanged from the September forecast but 8% below 2001.
The yield forecast, at 37.0 bushels per acre, was unchanged from last month but down 2.6 bushels from 2001.
Ending stocks are projected by the WAOB at 175 million bushels, up 15 million bushels from last month.
Soybean crush is unchanged this month as improved domestic meal use prospects offset a decline in soybean meal exports.
A market year average price is projected between $5.05 and $5.95 per bushel, compared to $4.35 for the 2001 crop.
Cotton - All cotton production is forecast at 18.1 million 480-pound bales, down less than 1% from last month and 11 percent below last year's record high production.
Yield is expected to average 674 pounds per harvested acre, down 1 pound from last month.
According to WAOB, domestic mill use is unchanged from last month.
Exports are reduced nearly 2%, reflecting sluggish demand by foreign mills.
These changes result in an increase in ending stocks to a level of 6.8 million bales.
The 2002/03 world outlook includes slightly lower consumption and trade.
World ending stocks are raised nearly 2% from last month.
Rice - Production is forecast at 212 million cwt, up 3% from September 1 but 1% below last year.
Area for harvest is expected to total 3.21 million acres, unchanged from last month but 3% below a year ago.
Yields are expected to average a record high 6,608 pounds per acre, an increase of 176 pounds from last month and up 179 pounds from 2001. Record high yields are forecast in Arkansas, Louisiana, Missouri, and Texas.
The market year average price is projected between $3.50 and $4.00 per cwt, compared to $4.17 per cwt for the 2001 crop.
Other Crops - Durum Wheat production, at 80.2 million bushels, is up 1% from August 1, but 4% less than last year.
Other Spring Wheat production is estimated at 402 million bushels, down 10% from the last forecast and 22% below a year ago.
Grain Sorghum production is forecast at 387 million bushels, up 1% from the September forecast but down 25% from 2001.
Barley production is estimated at 227 million bushels, down 10% from September and 9% below last year's estimate.
The peanut crop is expected to be down 12% from last year, and all tobacco production is down 11% from last year.
Cattle - Mid-October prices for choice steers (Nebraska direct, 1100-1300 pounds) averaged $66 per cwt, up $1 from mid-September.
Feeder steer prices (Oklahoma City, medium-large frame, 750-800 pounds) were $82 per cwt, $1 higher than a month ago.
Hogs - Through the first two weeks of October, hog slaughter was running roughly 101% of a year ago.
Cash prices at mid-October (Iowa-Southern Minnesota direct, 51-52% lean) averaged $33 per cwt, up $5 from the mid-September price.
Fourth quarter prices are expected to average $28 per cwt.
Agricultural Prices The preliminary All Farm Products Index of Prices Received by Farmers in October is 95, based on 1990-92=100, down 4 points (4.0 percent) from the September index.
Lower prices for broilers, potatoes, corn, and soybeans more than offset increased prices for hogs, wheat, milk, and tobacco.
The seasonal change in the mix of commodities farmers sell also affects the overall index.
Decreased marketings of wheat, milk, grapes, and tobacco more than offset increased marketings of soybeans, corn, cotton, and sorghum.
The current All Farm Products Index is 1 point (1.1 percent) above October 2001.
Lower prices for broilers, hogs, cattle, and peanuts are more than offset by higher prices for soybeans, corn, wheat, and sorghum.
The Food Commodities Index decreased 4 points (4.1 percent) below last month to 93, and is 3.1 percent below October last year.
The October Index of Prices Paid for Commodities and Services, Interest, Taxes, and Farm Wage Rates (PPITW) is 125 percent of the 1990-92 average.
The index is unchanged from September, but 2 points (1.6 percent) above October 2001.
Lower prices in October for milk cows, feed grains, nitrogen fertilizers, and hay and forages offset higher prices for complete feeds, feeder pigs, LP gas, and feeder cattle.
