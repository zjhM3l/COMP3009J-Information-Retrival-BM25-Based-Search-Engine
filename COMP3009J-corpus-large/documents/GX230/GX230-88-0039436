MICHAEL A. LIDSKY, USDA MR. LIDSKY: Good morning, and welcome to the 5 Animal and Plant Health Inspection Services public meeting 6 to discuss issues related to the administration of the 7 imported fire ant program by Plant Protection and Quarantine 8 in light of reduced funding for fiscal year 2000.
9 My name is Mike Lidsky.
I've been asked by the 10 Deputy Administrator for Plant Protection and Quarantine to 11 be the moderator for today's meeting.
With me are Mr. Ron 12 Milberg and Mr. Homer Collins.
13 Mr. Milberg is on my left, and he is the Senior 14 Staff Officer for the Invasive Species and Pest Management 15 Staff in Riverdale, Maryland.
This is the staff that 16 provides headquarters support to the imported fire ant 17 program.
18 Mr. Homer Collins is the research leader at the 19 Gulfport, Mississippi, Plant Methods Lab, and this lab is 20 charged with developing regulatory treatments for the 21 imported fire ant program.
He's on my right.
22 The purpose of today's meeting in Santa Ana is to 23 give interested persons an opportunity to present their 24 views or questions on the three options that APHIS has 25 presented for comment, as well as to present other possible 4 1 options for administering the imported fire ant regulatory 2 program in light of reduced funding.
3 Notice of today's meeting was published in the 4 Federal Register on March 2nd, on pages 11281 through 11283, 5 and extra copies of this notice are available at the 6 registration table.
7 Today's meeting in Santa Ana is the last of four 8 public meetings we're holding to solicit views from 9 interested persons.
The first three meetings were held in 10 Raleigh, North Carolina, Orlando, Florida, and Austin, 11 Texas.
12 The format for today's meeting will be as follows.
13 After I complete my remarks on the procedural aspect of the 14 meeting, Mr. Milberg will make a short presentation on the 15 history of the imported fire ant regulatory program, as well 16 as regulatory options we've asked persons to comment on.
17 Should any questions arise about the regulatory 18 treatments that are currently available or new regulatory or 19 control strategies that the Agency is pursuing, Mr. Collins 20 would be the best person to answer those questions.
21 Persons who have registered to speak will be given 22 an opportunity to speak before unregistered persons.
23 Today's meeting is scheduled to conclude at 24 5:00 p.m.
However, we will conclude the meeting before 5:00 25 if all persons who have registered to participate have been 5 1 heard and there are no other persons that wish to speak.
2 I will announce any other procedural rules for the 3 conduct of today's meeting as may be necessary.
All 4 comments made here today are being recorded and will be 5 transcribed.
The court reporter for today's meeting is 6 Ms. Nancy Paladino, who is associated with the Heritage 7 Reporting Corporation in Washington, D.C. 8 Those persons wishing to receive a copy of the 9 transcript should contact the Heritage Reporting Service at 10 (202) 628-4888.
A copy of the transcript shall be posted on 11 the APHIS web site at www.aphis.usda.gov in approximately 12 eight business days.
13 A copy of the transcript shall also be made 14 available for public inspection at the APHIS Reading Room in 15 Room 1141 of USDA South Building, 14th and Independence, 16 Washington, D.C. 17 As the moderator, I'll call each person that's 18 registered to make a prepared statement.

16 When submitting such comments by mail, please submit an 17 original and three copies.
18 Lastly, we ask that, before you leave today, if 19 you'd please take a minute or two to complete a brief survey 20 on the quality of today's meeting.
We'd like to get some 21 information as to accommodations and how we've been 22 conducting these meetings, to see if it's been satisfactory 23 to you.
Copies of the survey are available at the 24 registration desk, or I have some up front.
25 After Ron Milberg's presentation, I will call our 7 1 first registered speaker, who is Secretary of Agriculture 2 William Lyons.
3 4 5 6 Ron, why don't you commence.
RONALD P. MILBERG, USDA MR. MILBERG: Thank you, Mike.
This is my telephone number and so on, if anyone 7 wishes to contact me.
Today I'll provide some background 8 information on the IFA program, and then talk about how it's 9 evolved over the years, and, finally, discuss today's 10 situation a little bit.
11 Imported fire ants, or IFA, were introduced into 12 the southern states 60 to 80 years ago.
After the ants were 13 first observed, around 1920, landowners in infested areas 14 began applying available insecticides, such as calcium 15 cyanide.
16 With the advent of chlorinated hydrocarbons to 17 cost-effectively control ants, a federal quarantine was 18 established in 1958 to regulate infested areas.
The 19 quarantine currently regulates all or portions of Alabama, 20 Arkansas, California, Florida, Georgia, Louisiana, 21 Mississippi, New Mexico, North Carolina, Oklahoma, Puerto 22 Rico, South Carolina, Tennessee, and Texas.
The federal 23 quarantine regulates movement of articles known to spread 24 IFA, including nursery stock and soil.
25 Next slide, Tim.
8 1 The original program was a cooperative effort 2 between APHIS and the states in three areas, including 3 detection to find and eradicate isolated infestations, 4 regulatory activity to slow IFA spread by controlling the 5 movement of regulated articles, and, finally, control 6 activity to reduce populations using wide-area pesticide 7 applications.
8 9 Next slide.
As registrations and food tolerances for 10 chlorinated hydrocarbons were canceled in the 1960s and 11 '70s, wide-area pesticide applications were no longer 12 practical due to the poor efficacy of available pesticides.
13 The IFA program then shifted to baits and organophosphates.
14 Unfortunately, some of these compounds, such as 15 chloropyrifos, were less effective than previously used 16 materials.
17 During the 1980s, with the continued loss of 18 chemicals, the federal program focused on methods 19 development, primarily testing of new treatments.
This was 20 to certify regulated articles for interstate movement.
21 22 Next slide.
During the 1990s, appropriations for many federal 23 domestic programs declined or were capped, and the states 24 assumed more IFA survey and regulatory responsibility.
25 State activities were conducted in part using cooperative 9 1 funding agreements with APHIS.
Most federal dollars were 2 passed through to the states to ensure compliance with the 3 federal quarantine.
4 Tim, if we could put the graph up that shows the 5 funding, please.
6 As shown by this graph, the IFA program funding 7 declined from about $5,000,000 in 1990 to $100,000 in 2000.
8 Of this year's $100,000 appropriation, Congress earmarked 9 $58,000 for IFA work in New Mexico.
So, given the current 10 funding level, essentially no dollars are available for 11 pass-through to the other states.
12 13 Now let's go back to today's situation.
Despite the low funding level, APHIS continues to 14 maintain the federal quarantine by annually updating the 15 list of infested areas in the Federal Register.
In 16 addition, our investigative and enforcement services staff 17 looks into about 10 to 20 quarantine violations annually.
18 About a third of these cases are closed with 19 warnings issued by the local plant protection and quarantine 20 officer for a first-time violation.
21 Another third are closed with no action if the 22 shipping facility was under a compliance agreement and the 23 treatments were applied in accordance with that agreement.
24 The remaining third are assessed civil penalties 25 of up to $1,000 per violation, which is the maximum allowed 10 1 by statute.
A typical fine ranges from $500 to $2,000, 2 depending on the severity and the number of violations we 3 can charge.
4 5 Next slide.
Let me just say, before we go on here to the 6 current thing, that, in addition to the IES activity, APHIS 7 continues to focus on development of new regulatory 8 treatments and nursery compliance protocols to control or 9 reduce ant levels in nursery production areas.
About 10 $350,000 is allocated annually to Gulfport, Mississippi, for 11 methods development work, and, to our knowledge, Gulfport is 12 the only facility in the country that is developing IFA 13 regulatory treatments.
14 15 Now we'll go to potential options.
Given the above background, we decided to hold 16 public meetings and to get input on what direction the IFA 17 program should take.
To help stimulate discussion on this 18 issue, we proposed the three options shown.
19 Under option one, we would maintain our imported 20 fire ant program with minimal regulatory activity, in line 21 with current funding.
This option would provide uniform 22 standards and consistent interstate shipping requirements 23 for the regulated industry.
Under this option, with the 24 current funding level, most states would enforce the federal 25 quarantine without federal dollars.
11 1 Under option two, we would also eliminate the 2 federal quarantine and develop model guidelines for states 3 to use in harmonizing their quarantines.
This option would 4 reduce federal costs and may provide uniformity without 5 federal regulation.
However, under this option, states may 6 impose more or less stringent requirements, and these 7 requirements could differ from state to state.
8 Under option three, we would eliminate the IFA 9 regulations and would participate in establishing a 10 voluntary nursery certification program.
This option would 11 also reduce federal costs and may provide uniformity with 12 federal regulation.
However, such a certification program 13 is not mandatory and could result in less than 100-percent 14 participation.
15 At this time, the Agency has made no decision on 16 how to proceed.
All options, including any submitted in 17 writing or presented at this meeting, will be considered 18 before a final decision is proposed.
19 Thank you again for your interest today, and that 20 concludes my briefing.
21 MR. LIDSKY: Okay.
Our first speaker will be the 22 California Secretary of Agriculture, Mr. William Lyons.
23 24 25 WILLIAM J. LYONS, JR. CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF FOOD AND AGRICULTURE MR. LYONS: Thank you, Mr. Chairman, for the 12 1 opportunity to provide California's perspective regarding 2 the USDA's Imported Fire Ant Regulation.
California 3 Department of Food and Ag has enjoyed its relationship with 4 APHIS and looks forward to many more relationships.
5 California is the largest agricultural state in 6 the United States.
Our almost $27 billion industry provides 7 over 350 different commodities, including 55 percent of the 8 fruits and nuts that are consumed in the United States.
9 Over 11 percent of the U.S. agricultural exports come from 10 California.
11 My family has been in production agriculture in 12 Central Valley of California for 75 years.
As a rancher and 13 as a grower, as well as of a citizen of our beautiful state, 14 I am keenly aware of the serious impact that newly 15 introduced plant pests can have.
16 The California Department of Food and Agriculture 17 has reviewed the USDA's proposed regulatory strategies and 18 consulted with a number of our industry stakeholders and 19 many of our public leaders.
After consideration, we find 20 that none of the proposed options will meet the needs of our 21 agricultural community, the business community, or the 22 general public of the state of California.
23 Instead, CDFA recommends a fourth option, that the 24 federal domestic quarantine be maintained, and that funding 25 be restored for enforcement, research, and applied 13 1 technology to reduce the artificial spread of this serious 2 pest.
There is a consensus among the California ag industry 3 that maintaining the federal quarantine is necessary to 4 provide business with a level playing field across the 5 nation.
6 In addition to this, my department is under 7 mandate to protect the state from the entry and the 8 establishment of invasive pests.
Experience with the 9 imported fire ant in recent years has shown that the lack of 10 enforcement at the federal level has resulted in recent and 11 repeated introductions of imported fire ant into California.
12 As a result, we now have over 200 square miles infested with 13 red imported fire ant. 14 California is fighting a serious public and 15 environmental health problem, and has committed $10.7 16 million this year and over $40 million in the next five 17 years in an effort to eradicate this pest from our state.
18 This infestation also has placed a new and 19 difficult regulatory burden on California's ag industry.
20 Our nursery industry estimates it's spending $4 million 21 annually just to comply with the quarantine requirements.
22 As mentioned, our regulatory and control costs 23 will be in excess of $10 million this year alone, and we 24 urge the federal government to reimburse the California 25 Department of Food and Ag at least $1 million of this cost.
14 1 Nationally, federal inaction on fire ant 2 quarantines must not continue.
The USDA must provide 3 adequate resources, guidance, leadership, and a consistency 4 into enforcing and regulating the existing quarantine.
5 These actions will prevent individual states from creating a 6 host of regulations that are inconsistent, unenforceable, 7 and actually injure our agricultural community.
8 California nurserymen experienced firsthand when 9 the red imported fire ant was first found in our state.
For 10 this reason, option two, which recommends rescinding the 11 federal quarantine, is not acceptable.
12 As for option three, we do not believe that 13 repealing the quarantine and replacing it with a voluntary 14 self-certification program is an option at all.
The federal 15 notice itself mentions a serious weakness of this approach.
16 There would be no legal mandate for participation in a self17 certification program.
There would be little interest in a 18 voluntary program that would require additional costs for 19 production.
In any case, there would be no legal means to 20 keep states from enacting their own quarantines.
21 Again, California Department of Food and 22 Agriculture strongly recommends the maintenance of the 23 federal domestic quarantine and adequate funding for the 24 imported fire ant program.
25 Current funding for RIFA eradication programs 15 1 totals $100,000.
Over half of that amount is earmarked for 2 just one state, leaving less than $50,000 to be split 3 between the 13 states within the quarantine area.
The 4 National Plant Board recently identified a need to increase 5 the baseline budget of the USDA by $7.5 million to fund all 6 aspects of the imported fire ant regulatory program 7 nationwide.
8 On our part, states must work with the USDA and 9 our congressional delegations to secure these and other 10 funds to restore important domestic programs like fire ant 11 quarantine enforcement.
To assist in this, New Mexico, 12 Florida, Arizona, California, and Texas Departments of 13 Agriculture have formed a coalition to address these types 14 of funding issues.
The NFACT coalition is currently working 15 to inform our congressional delegations about the economic 16 devastation caused by the red imported fire ant for our ag 17 industries.
18 We appreciate USDA holding three of the four red 19 imported fire ant funding hearings in NFACT states, Florida, 20 Texas, and California.
However, we believe that USDA should 21 aggressively pursue additional emergency funding to prevent 22 the establishment of this pest in the border states.
NFACT 23 is the United States' first line of defense from foreign 24 pests and diseases along the southern border.
It is 25 imperative that adequate funding for all pest prevention and 16 1 detection programs be allocated.
2 NFACT has recently met with the USDA, U.S. Customs 3 Service, and the Office of Management and Budget in 4 Washington, D.C., to discuss this other invasive species 5 that negatively affects specialty crops and livestock.
6 NFACT will continue to be a strong advocate on behalf of 7 specialty crop and livestock ag to ensure their due 8 representation at the federal level.
9 For the record, I would like to submit the 10 following letter regarding the position of NFACT, which was 11 signed by all the five Secretaries and Directors of 12 Agriculture.
I think I've given you a copy of that letter.
13 14 MR. LIDSKY: Yes, sir.
MR. LYONS: Again, I'd like to thank you for the 15 opportunity to provide the California perspective on this 16 very important issue.
Thank you.
17 MR. LIDSKY: Mr. Secretary, thank you very much 18 for your comments, sir.
Appreciate it.
19 20 21 Our next speaker will be Supervisor Todd Spitzer.
TODD SPITZER, ORANGE COUNTY BOARD OF SUPERVISORS MR. SPITZER: Good morning, Mr. Chairman and 22 fellow Hearing Commissioners.
My name is Todd Spitzer, 23 Orange County supervisor, and I want to welcome you to 24 Orange County.
I hope you enjoy your stay here, and we are 25 very, very pleased to have you, the fact that you took the 17 1 time to not only come here, but hold your hearing here.
2 As you can see by the concerned citizens and 3 employees of both the county and state agencies behind me, 4 we are obviously very concerned about the future impact of 5 what the United States Government does with respect to red 6 imported fire ant. 7 I can tell you that we are your frontline troops, 8 and I think we've stepped up and taken a very proactive and 9 active role.
In fact, some days, I feel like we're actually 10 doing the hand-to-hand combat with these red imported fire 11 ants.
12 We're certainly at an important crossroads, 13 because we can win the battle here in Orange County and the 14 state of California, other southern California 15 jurisdictions, and then lose the war, because this pest 16 knows no jurisdictional or political boundaries.
This pest 17 doesn't say, "Oh, I'm going to remain in southern California 18 or Texas or Alabama."
19 In fact, by looking at your funding, it's pretty 20 important to me that, for a national program, the funding 21 has not only been abysmal in its heyday, but the steady 22 decrease, I think, is really quite offensive.
I mean, I 23 certainly recognize, nationwide, the pests and the role that 24 you must play, but I think that's why the Secretary has 25 ventured here with his staff from Sacramento, and I commend 18 1 him for being here, and I must commend him and his staff for 2 taking such a proactive role in working with Orange County.
3 Legislative leaders, Assemblyman Bill Campbell and 4 State Senator John Lewis, our representatives here, have 5 really carried the legislative front in Sacramento, and then 6 Doctor Bob Sjogren, who is in the audience today and has 7 been the leader at Vector Control, and, of course, Rick Le 8 Feuvre, who is our Agricultural Commissioner.
We've been 9 doing that battle.
So, if we do knock down this 10 enforcement, really, what good does it do? 11 We have said, time and time again, both as elected 12 officials and leaders in the community, that we are going to 13 do everything in our power not only to protect the industry, 14 which I think the Secretary highlighted very acutely this 15 morning, but we're talking about a quality of life here in 16 this region which has not yet been diminished by the red 17 imported fire ant. 18 Now, I recognize, in other parts of the country -- 19 and people who come here, in fact, during our hearings on 20 the red imported fire ant, people who have come to 21 California, and Orange County now, to live, have said, "Are 22 you crazy? I just came from those regions, and there's no 23 way you're going to be able to wipe out or control this red 24 imported fire ant." 25 Well, I heard earlier, and I saw the description, 19 1 of the types of pesticides and control mechanisms that we 2 now have in place.
When this pest came here so many years 3 ago, we were using pesticides that obviously were very 4 harsh, potentially harmful to the environment, and may have 5 worked, but either the pest became immune or they had such 6 offensive characteristics to the environment that, in terms 7 of the measures gained, it was too much of a risk, but we 8 have the technology,
in terms of fenoxycarbs that have been 9 employed, and the measures to control the red imported fire 10 ant have been amazing.
11 The harm to the community is virtually nil, based 12 upon the research that I have personally read, and the 13 testimony of experts in the field, not only entomologists, 14 biologists and those who deal with pesticides, have attested 15 to the fact that there is really an opportunity here to 16 knock down this pest, if not eradicate it, certainly control 17 it in a very serious way .
18 So I say that, and I lay that as my foundation, 19 because certainly the time is critical for leadership to 20 maintain, and not only maintain, the federal domestic 21 quarantine for the red imported fire ant, but to help us, 22 and we've already done some of this work, lay the 23 foundation, and be proactive in terms of getting our 24 congressional -- because we've already done it with the 25 state delegation -- getting our congressional delegation to 20 1 start to whip up the frenzy in Washington to get you the 2 funding to make this program work.
3 I understand, because I sit on that side most of 4 the time -- in fact, my nameplate is still up there, so it's 5 kind of interesting for me to be on this side of the dias -6 but I understand it's very hard to come forward with a very 7 proactive program when you don't have the funding to back up 8 that program.
So you'd better believe that we have, as the 9 Secretary has indicated, not only communicated with our 10 congressional members and our United States Senators, but 11 the Chairman of the Board, Chuck Smith.
12 I recently read -- in fact, the first week in 13 March, we sent a letter to all the delegates, and we will 14 follow up, because we understand that it's not just us 15 asking you to do something.
You need the tools to make it 16 happen, and you can only make a recommendation that's 17 consistent with the money that backs up that program.
18 We've been very fortunate, because of the 19 leadership of Secretary Lyons, Doctor Sjogren, and Rick Le 20 Feuvre, that we have brought the funding to Orange County, 21 but our funding is greater in total for this region than it 22 is for you for the entire nation.
Tell me there isn't an 23 inconsistency there, or something that our leaders should 24 not blink their eyes at.
25 Without the federal quarantine, then -- and, so, 21 1 recognizing that, we are embarked on this -- as the 2 Secretary, he's already put together this multiagricultural 3 Secretary group through many of the affected states, but, 4 assuming that we can get that support, then let me tell you 5 what, obviously, we're looking for.
6 We need that federal quarantine, because many of 7 the noninfested states certainly could implement different 8 and possibly tougher shipping requirements for their 9 commodities, and the lack of uniformity -- certainly, 10 Mr. Chairman, I don't need to tell you, as a lawyer, but 11 certainly a lack of uniformity, without that quarantine, 12 could certainly result in confusion in interstate commerce, 13 and we know that, you know, states are pretty much free to 14 do what they want under the Interstate Commerce Clause.
15 Related ongoing research programs would also be eliminated, 16 and we've been very proactive in that venture.
17 With a federal quarantine, we can help prevent a 18 patchwork of state fire ant quarantines throughout the 19 nation, and I think consistency is important.
Especially, 20 in my opinion, one of the things we've been very concerned 21 about is the widespread application of pesticides, and 22 that's why I've been very pleased by the advance in the use 23 of fenoxycarbs, and I think that if we stop that research, 24 then we're doing all of ourselves harm.
25 The Orange County Board of Supervisors, the state 22 1 elected officials that I've mentioned, the California 2 Department of Food and Ag, and the industry have worked 3 together to implement the state-funded eradication plan 4 right throughout the state and certainly here in southern 5 California.
We have a $26 billion industry in California, 6 and it's a $300 million industry to Orange County.
7 The red imported fire ant was first discovered in 8 Trabuco Canyon, which is in the Third Supervisorial 9 District, my district, and throughout my district we have 10 just a phenomenal amount of nurseries and nursery products.
11 We export products all over the world, and it's been very 12 burdensome, I think, the demands we've put on the industry 13 in terms of treating their soil.
14 As you know, they don't use the -- they can use 15 the fenoxycarb, but, pretty much, they do the dredge system 16 with the diazinon, and even though they internally control 17 that and recover that pesticide, I don't think any of us 18 like the fact that we are introducing large amounts of 19 pesticides in our environment.
20
Certainly the infestation has already caused an 21 estimated $1 billion annually in losses and control costs in 22 the 11 southeastern states, and the University of California 23 economists have estimated that the long-term costs to our 24 residents and industries could likely total more than 25 $1 billion annually if those fire ants were allowed to be 23 1 spread just throughout California alone
.
2 It's certainly hard to put a price tag on the 3 consequences of RIFA to our quality of life and our wildland 4 biodiversity, but we know those little pests, you know, can 5 take down small animals.
They can certainly invade our 6 NCCP, which is our conservation program, which we work very 7 hard on with the federal government, for set-asides, the 8 cooperative federal, state, and local government efforts, 9 then, to stop the red imported fire ant will possibly 10 eliminate this problem which has been so devastating in 11 other states.
12 I therefore join with the Secretary, William 13 Lyons, in urging you to consider and then make a 14 recommendation on that fourth option, which is to maintain 15 the quarantine and work with us, and make recommendations to 16 secure the funding.
I don't think it's realistic to come 17 forward with a program in which funding is as de minimis as 18 the funding that is currently allocated in this particular 19 arena.
20 So, that being said, we are your frontline troops.
21 We will continue to be your frontline troops.
We are waging 22 this war because we think it's a war that needs to be 23 fought.
However, if we don't have any of the resources 24 behind us, and we have nothing to help us, to alleviate us 25 when we run out of our, you know, red imported fire ant 24 1 strength, if you will, we can't afford to have those states 2 behind us not bringing in the resources and fighting the 3 battle on their own fronts.
4 Otherwise, our battle is going to be wasted.
It 5 will actually mean nothing.
I want to qualify that, because 6 I think it's important that we have a local program, but we 7 know our battle just will wage on if we don't have the 8 protections from the other states.
9 Mr. Chairman, I appreciate very much your time.
10 Certainly my comments, most of it, a lot of it, was more 11 impromptu, but I do have at least a synopsis of my main 12 points that I will give to the clerk.
Thank you very much, 13 gentlemen, for your time.
I appreciate it very much.
14 MR. LIDSKY: Thank you, Supervisor Spitzer.
Also, 15 USDA would like to thank you for the use of this hearing 16 facility.
It's a great room.
Thank you for your time.
17 18 MR. SPITZER: Thank you, sir.
MR. LIDSKY: Our next registered speaker is 19 Mr. John -- looks like Caravetta, and I apologize for the 20 mispronunciation of your name.
21 22 JOHN CARAVETTA, ARIZONA DEPARTMENT OF AGRICULTURE MR. CARAVETTA: Good morning, Mr. Chairman.
My 23 name is John Caravetta.
24 25 MR. LIDSKY: Thank you, sir.
MR. CARAVETTA: I'm the Associate Director 25 1 representing the Arizona Department of Agriculture.
We 2 appreciate the opportunity the USDA-APHIS-PPQ has presented 3 for affected stakeholders to comment on the proposed Agency 4 course of action relevant to the federal fire ant 5 quarantine.
6 The red imported fire ant, or IFA, is a serious 7 pest currently found in 13 states.
This situation has 8 forced producers, residents, and municipalities to spend 9 millions in each state annually to achieve a modest level of 10 suppression.
With the advent of isolated infested regions 11 of California and New Mexico, Arizona is under even greater 12 pressure to continue successful exclusion and detection 13 activities to bar this scourge from establishment in the 14 state.
15 To assist my department's efforts, Governor J.D. 16 Hull, in January 1999, declared a state of emergency, 17 releasing some $200,000 in funds to bolster the highly 18 successful exclusion and detection efforts of the Arizona 19 Department of Agriculture.
20 To date, Arizona remains free from established 21 infestations of the red imported fire ant.
This success 22 would be severely jeopardized had the federal quarantine not 23 been in place.
Arizona needs USDA's continued and increased 24 involvement to prevent the spread of IFA into the state and 25 other areas currently not infested.
26 1 The federal quarantine, in the past, has served to 2 slow the spread of IFA and provide a level playing field in 3 the regulation of a variety of conveyance methods associated 4 with this pest.
The absence of this broad quarantine would 5 force regulatory agencies such as the Arizona Department of 6 Agriculture to impose a substantial external quarantine to 7 protect the state's agricultural industry, public well8 being, and associated quality of life.
Most likely, Arizona 9 would not be alone in this action, creating havoc for the 10 industries impacted by such a quarantine.
11 For fiscal year 2000, PPQ is proposing three 12 options: one, maintain the federal quarantine; two, rescind 13 the federal quarantine and develop model quarantine 14 guidelines for states; three, rescind and develop a 15 voluntary nursery self-certification program.
The Arizona 16 Department of Agriculture recommends USDA-APHIS-PPQ continue 17 with and improve the existing quarantine, while restoring 18 funding to the $1 million level established since 1996 for 19 the current fiscal year.
20 Furthermore, the Arizona Department of Agriculture 21 supports the National Plant Board's proposal to increase the 22 baseline budget of PPQ in fiscal year 2001 by $7.5 million 23 to fund the IFA quarantine program, with the understanding 24 this money would not be allowed to be redirected to other 25 PPQ programs.
27 1 The ADA has taken an active role in advocating 2 this appropriation through both NFACT, a regional coalition, 3 and NASDA.
The Arizona Department of Agriculture thanks 4 USDA-APHIS-PPQ for the opportunity to comment on this issue, 5 and remains committed to the continued cooperation in 6 addressing invasive species to the benefit of our 7 stakeholders.
Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
8 MR. LIDSKY: We thank you, sir.
Sir, could you 9 spell your last name for the benefit of the court reporter? 10 MR. CARAVETTA: Yes.
The last name is spelled 11 C-A-R-A, V as in Victor, E-T-T-A.
Thank you.
12 13 14 15 MR. LIDSKY: Thanks.
Thanks very much.
Ms. Sherry Sanderson, please.
SHERRY SANDERSON, NEW MEXICO DEPARTMENT OF AGRICULTURE MS. SANDERSON: Good morning, Mr. Chairman, and 16 thank you for holding this hearing today.
I'm Sherry 17 Sanderson, and I am the Bureau Chief of the Entomology and 18 Nursery Industry Bureau of the New Mexico Department of 19 Agriculture, and MDA would like to thank the United States 20 Department of Agriculture Animal and Plant Health Inspection 21 Service for holding this hearing on the red imported fire 22 ant quarantine and taking testimony from the affected 23 stakeholders.
24 In 1998, an ant sample was collected from a small 25 residential community in Dona Ana County, New Mexico, and 28 1 was confirmed by USDA as red imported fire ants.
Surveys 2 performed have identified an infested area in Dona Ana 3 County.
Fire ant infestations have been found in public, 4 residential, industrial, and agricultural areas where water 5 is available.
It's very crucial to our area.
6 Survey results and technical advice received from 7 the United States Department of Agriculture Plant Health 8 Inspection Service, Plant Protection and Quarantine Section, 9 indicated that eradication of a red imported fire ant 10 infestation of this magnitude would be cost-prohibitive and 11 likely unobtainable.
12 In August of 1998, Dona Ana County, New Mexico, 13 was placed under an interior state quarantine.
In February 14 of 2000, Dona Ana County was added to the federal fire ant 15 quarantine.
Currently, the fire ant infestation is 16 contained to Dona Ana County, and the remaining 32 counties 17 of New Mexico remain uninfested.
18 The New Mexico Department of Agriculture has just 19 embarked upon the regulation of red imported fire ants in 20 New Mexico, and has found it is not an easy task.
Many 21 valuable lessons were learned this year, this past year, 22 during the first few weeks of the infested status.
Many 23 phone calls were made to the United States Department of 24 Agriculture and other states to obtain information on 25 compliance agreements, chemical treatments, and 29 1 interpretations of approved treatments.
2 One message I received from colleagues of infested 3 states was that the emphasis of the quarantine was gone.
4 Many of the original participants of your quarantine program 5 had been replaced, and the original importance and emphasis 6 on the quarantine had been lost.
It is believed that this 7 lack of enthusiasm was directly related to the lack of 8 funding and minimal oversight of the quarantine program.
9 At this time, the United States Department of 10 Agriculture has proposed three potential courses of action 11 with respect to the red imported fire ant program, the first 12 being to maintain the program with minimal funding.
As 13 stated by APHIS, "Under this option, states would continue 14 to enforce the federal quarantine without federal funding."
15 Unfunded mandates, as we all know, are difficult, if not 16 impossible, for states to carry out.
Without proper 17 funding, there will be no fire ant quarantine.
18 As a second option, the United States Department 19 of Agriculture has proposed to eliminate the imported fire 20 ant regulations and develop a model guideline for states to 21 use in harmonizing their quarantine, but, as seen with the 22 Japanese beetle harmonization plans, all states will not 23 choose to participate under the same guidelines, and there 24 is a fear for states of imposing their own quarantines.
25 This will result in a nightmare of regulations for those 30 1 companies shipping nursery products in interstate commerce.
2 The third proposal, of eliminating the imported 3 fire ant regulations and establishing a voluntary nursery 4 self-certification program -- the quarantine is in effect 5 now, and there are problems with certification of products.
6 How is a voluntary program going to be an improvement? We 7 don't see that that is a viable option.
8 The fire ant infestation in New Mexico is proof 9 that the ants are still spreading.
The New Mexico 10 Department of Agriculture is in full support of the federal 11 imported fire ant quarantine, and supports the National 12 Plant Board and NFACT's recommendation to restore and 13 increase USDA's funding to a level that will support the 14 efforts of the regulatory agencies responsible for the 15 administration of the quarantine.
16 Without proper funding levels to support the 17 biocontrol options, the development of efficacious pesticide 18 treatments, and proper quality assurance of the 19 certification program, uninfested states will not remain 20 uninfested.
21 The imported fire ant not only causes economic 22 problems for the agricultural and commercial nurseries 23 shipping products out of the quarantine area, but it also 24 decreases the quality of life in an infested area.
The New 25 Mexico Department of Agriculture is dedicated to preserving 31 1 the quality of life in New Mexico by preventing the spread 2 and further invasion of the red imported fire ant. 3 The New Mexico Department of Agriculture would 4 like to urge Congress to restore and increase funding to 5 maintain the federal imported fire ant regulations, as this 6 funding is necessary to keep the remaining uninfested states 7 free of fire ants.
8 I would like to thank you for this opportunity to 9 comment on these proposed changes, and offer New Mexico's 10 complete support for the federal fire ant program.
Thank 11 you, Mr. Chairman.
12 MR. LIDSKY: And thank you very much for your 13 comments.
14 15 16 Mr. Jack Wick, please.
JACK WICK, CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATION OF NURSERYMEN MR. WICK: Good morning.
My name is Jack Wick, 17 W-I-C-K.
I'm the Regulatory Consultant for the California 18 Association of Nurserymen.
19 I would like to compliment the USDA-APHIS for 20 maintaining the fire ant quarantine through these many years 21 of the chart you showed with the funding dropping down to 22 zilch.
You've maintained it, and we've been grateful to you 23 for that.
24 I might as well give my commendation to Congress 25 and the Budget Office or whoever keeps reducing that 32 1 funding, because they are apparently quite unaware there is 2 a lot of California that doesn't have a red imported fire 3 ant at this time.
We'd like to keep it that way, and get 4 rid of it where we do have it.
5 We also see the last speaker had 32 counties that 6 didn't have the red imported fire ant, and the Congress 7 doesn't seem to care a great deal about that as far as what 8 might transpire in the future.
9 I guess I'm getting to the point that we support 10 APHIS maintaining the quarantine.
If you get the additional 11 funding, wonderful, but it might take some while to do that.
12 I would recommend or encourage, as much as possible -- maybe 13 you already do it -- cooperating with everybody else that's 14 interested in this issue, university researchers.
15 EPA, for example, has funding occasionally, and 16 they would like to see less pesticides used.
See if they 17 can help you in your research department by granting for 18 various kinds of research that might be helpful on this 19 problem, to reduce the use of pesticides but still eliminate 20 the ants, and I think that type of liaison might be an area 21 that APHIS could be helpful in, with many, many different 22 kinds of interested people.
23 The health departments don't like to have people 24 bitten, stung, and so forth.
Maybe they would be, in some 25 states, willing to help on it, if they're in a position to 33 1 do so.
That needs some coordination, however, and right now 2 I don't know of any coordination of who's all interested in 3 this problem, and recommendations as to some coordination 4 and cooperation in this regard.
5 I think research is the key for our future here, 6 and imported red fire ant problems.
I've been around for 50 7 years in this industry, the nursery industry in California, 8 and this is the worst pest we've ever had.
It is a 9 miserable one, and I sure hope you fellows can come up with 10 some brilliant idea how to reduce the impact to us.
Thank 11 you very much.
12 MR. LIDSKY: Thank you very much, sir.
Mr. Burt 13 Tibbet, please.
14 15 BURT TIBBET, NURSERY GROWERS ASSOCIATION OF CALIFORNIA MR. TIBBET: My name is Burt Tibbet.
I'm 16 President of the Nursery Growers Association of California.
17 Tibbet is spelled T-I-B-B-E-T.
18 I, as the others have, want to thank you for the 19 opportunity to speak to you on this subject that we'd rather 20 not have to talk about at all.
Members of our association 21 are spending tens of millions of dollars a year in a control 22 mode of the red imported fire ant.
It is our commitment to 23 assist all of the other allied interests in California to 24 eradicate the RIFA from the state.
25 We also would like to encourage you folks to 34 1 maintain the program, increase the funding, as the Secretary 2 said, develop the fourth option, and develop a program that 3 looks beyond the nursery industry as the focal point for 4 transporting the red imported fire ant. 5 In the state of California, our exclusion program 6 has determined that the RIFA has been brought to our state 7 by many, many vehicles, including air conditioning units, 8 beehives, hay haulers, land developers, dirt excavators, and 9 the list goes on, and yet the program, overall, seems to 10 lack any consistent effort in eliminating these other 11 sources as transfer agents for this pest.
12 I, like others in our association, believe this is 13 a health and safety issue as well as an economic issue, and 14 for that reason, we believe that with environmental 15 interests and personal interests of the consumers of the 16 state, the fourth option needs to be developed fully.
17 We are interested only in an eradication program.
18 You can't have Congress hitting us with an increase in the 19 minimum hourly wage rate and continue to heap control costs 20 for RIFA on top of us, too.
We appreciate whatever effort 21 you make, and if you will direct to us any effort that you 22 think we can make to help you in a grassroots effort, we'll 23 certainly work towards that end.
Thank you.
24 25 MR. LIDSKY: Thank you very much, sir.
Mr. R.D. Sjogren, please.
35 1 2 ROBERT SJOGREN MR. SJOGREN: Good morning.
My name is Doctor 3 Robert Sjogren, S-J-O-G-R-E-N.
I am speaking in support of 4 the unanimous comments that have been offered this morning 5 to maintain the quarantine, and I'd like to speak from the 6 background of a medical entomologist.
7 I have worked in vector control for over 30 years, 8 and I am a medical entomologist by profession, and this, as 9 has been mentioned to you this morning, obviously, it is a 10 serious problem for the nursery industry and agriculture in 11 California.
12 Also, as the previous speaker spoke, it is a very 13 serious concern to those of us in public health and 14 entomology in California that this ant be addressed and 15 eradicated, if possible, in California, and it is something 16 that obviously a great amount of education is needed for our 17 federal legislators, to let them know what is the insect, 18 and that's something that we'll be working very strongly 19 with.
20 I am the Director of the Orange County Vector 21 Control District, working under a subcontract with the 22 county of Orange and funded by the state of California, 23 which we will be responsible for the field program under a 24 banner of Orange County fire ant authority.
25 We're grateful for Doctor Collins' work over the 36 1 years that has provided us the expertise and the basic 2 information that we are able to go forward with from this 3 time, but, very definitely, as has been mentioned 4 previously, much more money needs to be put into work such 5 as Doctor Collins is doing.
6 So I think that's the main point, that this is a 7 public health problem, and it's one which, as a member of 8 some 60 vector control districts in California -- the 9 California Mosquito and Vector Control Association, they are 10 very concerned, also, that this pest does not spread 11 throughout California, and endanger the high quality of life 12 that we enjoy so much here.
Thank you very much.
13 14 MR. LIDSKY: Thank you very much.
Our next speaker is Ms. Cheryl -- I believe it's 15 Guar, G-U-A-R (sic)? 16 17 CHERYL GOAR, ARIZONA NURSERY ASSOCIATION MS. GOAR: My name is Cheryl Goar, G-O-A-R.
I'm 18 Executive Director of the Arizona Nursery Association.
We 19 are a 400-member association which represents retail 20 nurseries, wholesale nurseries, and associated businesses in 21 the state of Arizona.
22 According to Arizona's latest economic impact 23 survey of the green industry, we contribute 947 million to 24 the state's economy.
We continue to be one of the most 25 rapidly growing sectors in our state, with 9.4 percent 37 1 annual growth, and, important to this issue, 50.8 million in 2 exports to other states.
Our industry ships and receives a 3 lot of product.
4 Our members believe APHIS should maintain the 5 federal fire ant program.
From the Arizona industry's 6 perspective, this quarantine allows for a coordinated, 7 consistent approach to stopping or at least slowing the fire 8 ant spread.
For the nursery and greenhouse industry, the 9 quarantine means one set of uniform rules for shipping 10 products interstate.
11 It would be extremely difficult for our member 12 nurseries to track and comply with different rules in five, 13 10, or even more states.
We do not support adding to the 14 burden already placed on our nurseries striving to currently 15 comply with regulations.
Our member nurseries are already 16 bearing costs to comply with this quarantine, because they 17 view it as vital to their continued business.
18 Specifically in Arizona, our nurseries develop 19 special quarantine holding areas, and they are willing to 20 increase the time it takes to turn around that nursery stock 21 while waiting for insect identification from the Department 22 of Agriculture.
We believe the federal government should be 23 involved in this program, because the imported fire ant is a 24 very troublesome health and agricultural pest.
25 As a still-uninfested state, Arizona is committing 38 1 a large amount of dollars in our effort to remain 2 uninfested.
This task is becoming harder for Arizona, as 3 our neighbors to the east and west, California and New 4 Mexico, are now fighting their own battles with this pest.
5 Our members have never worked more closely with 6 our friends at the Arizona Department of Agriculture to help 7 combat the introduction of this pest into our state.
We do 8 recognize that this program is a cooperative federal and 9 state effort, and we encourage APHIS to keep the program in 10 that direction.
11 In closing, we not only advocate that APHIS retain 12 the federal quarantine partnership between the state and 13 federal government, but, also, we encourage restoration of 14 the estimated 3.5 million in funding for the USDA-APHIS fire 15 ant line item, to help ensure a viable and effective 16 quarantine which is proposed by the National Plant Board, 17 although we realize you do not have the power to restore the 18 funding, but we are committed and will be working on 19 potential methods to secure this funding.
Thank you for the 20 opportunity to speak with you today.
21 MR. LIDSKY: And thank you very much for your 22 comments.
23 Is Mr. Robert Gronowski here from the Nevada 24 Department of Agriculture? 25 (No response.)
39 1 MR. LIDSKY: He asked that we keep the meeting 2 open until his arrival.
He expected to arrive at 10:00 a.m. 3 So we will do that.
4 I have just run through the list of people that 5 have registered to speak, and now what I'd like to do is 6 call persons that may be in the audience that have some 7 comments they would like to have entered into the record, 8 people that are so-called unregistered speakers, if there 9 are any.
10 If you could spell your name, please, for the 11 court reporter, please, sir.
12 13 DON GILCHRIST, OFFICE OF STATE SENATOR JOHN LEWIS MR. GILCHRIST: Certainly, yes.
Thank you.
My 14 name is Don Gilchrist, spelled G-I-L-C-H-R-I-S-T.
I'm 15 administrative assistant to State Senator John Lewis.
16 State Senator Lewis' legislative district includes 17 the north and eastern portion of Orange County, and includes 18 the largest nursery/growing area in Orange County, and 19 includes a large section of the Cleveland National Forest, 20 as well, and extends from the northern boundary of Orange 21 County down to the area of San Clemente on the San Diego 22 County border.
23 The residents of our district and the many 24 jurisdictions, political jurisdictions, within our district 25 are very concerned about the spread of the fire ant, and 40 1 including the many school districts, golf courses, 2 condominium associations, as well as all the nursery growers 3 whom you've already heard from.
4 It was Senator Lewis' initial sponsorship, 5 authorship of SB204 in the state of California which began 6 the process that led to the establishment of the state 7 program that you heard about from Secretary Lyons.
8 I'd like to just point out for the record that 9 this legislation passed through the houses, the two houses 10 of our legislature, with no negative votes.
We have an 8011 house assembly -- 80-member assembly and a 40-member senate 12 in California, so there was a clear recognition by the 13 members in our state legislature of the importance and the 14 potential hazard that this pest represents, and I think we 15 have a better-than-good chance of making this case known to 16 our congressional representatives.
17 They all recognize the importance of agriculture 18 to our state, the importance of our lifestyle to the 19 citizens of our communities, and will be willing to assist 20 with programs such as you're proposing and such as the other 21 speakers are proposing for the augmentation of your budget 22 and augmentation of your quarantine programs.
23 Again, thank you for the opportunity to speak 24 unplanned, unannounced, and without comments for the record.
25 Thank you.
41 1 2 MR. LIDSKY: And thank you very much, sir.
Are there any other persons in the audiences that 3 would like to speak or have any questions they'd like to ask 4 the panel? 5 6 (No response.)
MR. LIDSKY: Ron, would you like to make a 7 statement about the funding situation? 8 MR. MILBERG: I think most people in the audience 9 understand that -- or you may not know, but the Agency has 10 not requested funding for the IFA program since 1994.
11 It's basically, I guess, a political shell game, 12 where Congress -- you know, the Agency would not request the 13 funding, and Congress would put it back year after year, and 14 then the politics of the situation change, or the budget 15 processes get so complicated -- it fell in a crack this 16 year, and Congress did not put the money in. 17 Even so, I think it mentions in the Federal 18 Register notice that they did give us $100,000, although we 19 again asked for nothing.
So, I mean, that's better than 20 nothing.
21 The fact is, APHIS has to -- our managers have to 22 stay within the present budget, and we're only allocated so 23 many dollars, and the Agency's management gets together and 24 ranks all the various programs, and they're basically 25 numbered 1 through 30, and IFA has come out below the cut 42 1 where funding is requested, and that's how the Agency winds 2 up not requesting money for it.
3 So we just need to understand that it's not the 4 fact that Congress has said, "We're going to cut the funding 5 in the program."
They just, I don't know, went along with 6 the Agency this year.
So what happens in the future remains 7 to be seen.
8 MR. LIDSKY: Right.
We didn't want to leave 9 anyone with the impression that we're blaming Congress.
10 Certainly your remarks today, if they're known to Congress, 11 that will be very helpful.
And as far as where we are in 12 the budget process, we have submitted our budget for fiscal 13 year 2001.
14 The administrator, Doctor Craig Regelbrugge, 15 testified in mid-March about the APHIS budget, and the way 16 the appropriations process works is the Agency -- or the 17 President actually submits a budget, and then Congress, 18 through the appropriations process, has the option of adding 19 to the Agency's request, and usually the budget is put in 20 place before the start of the next fiscal year, which would 21 be October 1.
So we're hoping that, as a result of these 22 hearings and your concerns, that money will be added for the 23 2001 budget and for future years, as well.
24 25 MR. PROFFITT: Excuse me.
MR. LIDSKY: Yes, sir.
43 1 MR. PROFFITT: There were three other meetings, in 2 Raleigh -3 MR. LIDSKY: Sir, we're going to need you to come 4 to the podium, and spell your name for the record, please.
5 6 MIKE PROFFITT MR. PROFFITT: Okay.
Mike Proffitt, last name 7 spelled P-R-O-F-F-I-T-T, almost like making money, but not 8 quite.
There is a little humor in that, but today, with 9 RIFA and other things, the money end is getting narrower.
10 Margins are getting much, much more less.
11 Being a member of a local nursery in Irvine, 12 Almadino (phonetic) Gardens, we, of course, being part of 13 the quarantine, have been asked to supplement our soil with 14 chemicals to keep RIFA from being spread, et cetera, setting 15 up trapping every three months, going along with the 16 quarantine basis.
That's a good thing, and it has been for 17 over a year now.
18 The problem I see is, if we take funding away, we 19 let people do whatever they want to do, this is going to 20 become a national pest.
It's going to become detrimental to 21 not only agriculture, but everything else everybody has seen 22 today.
That's my three cents' worth this morning.
23 I'd like to sit here and say, "Thank you for 24 coming," but I'd really rather sit here and say, "I wouldn't 25 want to see you here, anyway, because we have the funding to 44 1 do this.
We don't have to sit here and go through the 2 political process."
3 There were three other meetings, one in Raleigh, 4 one in Orlando, one in Austin.
Could you give us a quick 5 synopsis -- I'm supposing that you all were at those 6 hearings, too -- of what happened at those meetings, what 7 the outcome -- what those people's feelings were, and where 8 we kind of have a comparison of what's going on? 9 10 11 MR. LIDSKY: Sure.
MR. PROFFITT: Thank you.
MR. LIDSKY: The meeting in Orange County is not 12 unlike the other three meetings we've held.
There was very 13 strong and unequivocal support for maintaining the 14 quarantine and continuing the cooperative relationship we 15 have with the states through the plant boards and state 16 departments of agriculture, and there were comments that 17 requested Congress to add between 3.5 million and 7.5 18 million to the APHIS budget.
19 So you're right on target as far as the comments 20 that we've heard elsewhere.
I'm glad you asked the 21 question.
Thank you.
22 MR. MILBERG: I think one thing that was mentioned 23 at the other meetings that hasn't come up here today, maybe, 24 is the concept of user fees, where the regulated industry 25 helps pay for the quarantine, and I just would like to say 45 1 there are no plans to do that.
That's not even under 2 consideration.
3 It's been pointed out, at the other meetings and 4 here, that the nurseries do spend a lot of money on these 5 treating materials already, and the benefits of the 6 quarantine, as Craig Regelbrugge has said, accrue to 7 communities widely in terms of the reduction in danger to 8 health and equipment and so on that also comes along with 9 IFA.
So it's not just the nursery industry that's being 10 singled out here, and there are no plans to try and develop 11 a domestic user fee program.
12 13 14 MR. LIDSKY: Any other comments or questions? (No response.)
MR. LIDSKY: I think what we should do, since 15 Mr. Gronowski hasn't arrived, is take a short recess, and 16 resume, say, at 10:45, please.
Thank you very much.
17 18 (Whereupon, a brief recess was taken.)
MR. LIDSKY: All right.
Our next speaker is 19 Mr. Robert Gronowski, and if you could spell your name for 20 the benefit of the court reporter, please.
21 22 ROBERT GRONOWSKI, NEVADA DEPARTMENT OF AGRICULTURE MR. GRONOWSKI: Yes.
My name is Robert Gronowski, 23 G-R-O-N-O-W-S-K-I.
Good morning.
I'm the Administrator of 24 the Plant Industry Division of the Nevada Department of 25 Agriculture, and I'm here today representing the Nevada 46 1 Department of Agriculture, and also representing the Western 2 Plant Board.
3 The Western Plant Board is a group of state and 4 province plant administrators throughout the West, the 13 5 states.
The province of British Columbia, the province of 6 Alberta, and the Republic of Mexico are all members of the 7 Western Plant Board.
8 We applaud USDA-APHIS for holding this meeting and 9 permitting affected stakeholders to comment on the course of 10 action the Agency should take on the imported fire ant 11 program.
That profoundly affects the uninfested western 12 states.
It also provides a forum whereby congressional 13 leaders, those who provide the Agency with the necessary 14 level of funding and authority, have the opportunity to 15 listen to the concerns of the Agency's stakeholders.
16 The red imported fire ant is a serious pest that 17 currently infests 13 states.
This pest causes undesirable 18 economic, environmental, and public health effects.
These 19 effects have been documented in every infested state.
20 The minimization of the artificial spread of the 21 imported fire ant has been the goal of the imported fire ant 22 quarantine since it was enacted.
It provides a level 23 playing field for the industries that ship nursery stock and 24 other regulated articles interstate.
25 Without the existence of the federal quarantine, 47 1 individual states, most likely, and I almost would guarantee 2 it, will pass their own state quarantine.
This is going to 3 make it very difficult, because there might be 50 4 quarantines established with different kinds of standards 5 that would be applied, very difficult for the nursery 6 industry to separate them and certify them to the various 7 states.
8 In recent years, imported fire ant populations 9 within the quarantine area have increased in size 10 exponentially due to the loss of effective control tools and 11 underfunding for quality control measures within the federal 12 regulatory program.
13 As the pest population has increased within the 14 infested area, it has put additional pressures on the 15 ability of regulatory programs to prevent the spread through 16 both natural and artificial means.
The states need USDA's 17 continued and increased involvement to prevent IFA spread in 18 new areas, and development and implementation of biocontrol 19 tools for the suppression of imported fire ant populations 20 within the infested states.
21 Shipments of regulated articles that are certified 22 free of imported fire ant are arriving in uninfested states 23 with imported fire ant present in those shipments.
This 24 should not happen if a plant quarantine program is 25 effective.
The USDA-PPQ needs to provide increased 48 1 oversight of cooperative programs with the state regulatory 2 agencies for quarantine compliance.
3 Current funding allocated by PPQ to infested 4 states for ensuring compliance is not sufficient.
5 Enforcement of a federal quarantine within an underfunded, 6 infested state may not be a high priority for the 7 cooperating state to dedicate state funds for the delivery 8 of that federal program.
9 The USDA needs to adequately fund these states, 10 and provide oversight of the state programs to ensure 11 quarantine and delimiting surveys are being adequately 12 addressed.
Uninfested states are demanding the protection 13 that a strong enforced federal quarantine is designed to 14 afford them.
Even partially infested states are demanding 15 this protection.
16 Since 1996, PPQ has funded the imported fire ant 17 through a $1 million appropriation.
Prior to 1996, funding 18 was at a much higher level.
A $1 million program does not 19 provide adequate protection.
Artificial spread has been 20 substantive in the recent years due to the reduction of 21 federal resources into the program.
California alone will 22 spend over $10 million in the next five years in an attempt 23 to eradicate imported fire ants.
Arizona is also conducting 24 expensive imported fire ant eradication in Yuma, Arizona.
25 There are some promising biological control agents 49 1 that have recently been discovered.
Additional funding 2 would assist in evaluating these new agents in using them to 3 lower the pest pressure in infested areas.
New insect 4 growth regulators have also proven to be effective in 5 eradication of newly established infestation outside the 6 generally infested area.
There may be a method to use 7 biocontrol agents and chemicals in a slow-the-spread program 8 in the future.
9 For FY '92 (sic), PPQ is proposing three options: 10 one, maintain the federal quarantine; two, rescind the 11 federal quarantine and develop model state requirements; or, 12 three, establish a voluntary self-certification program.
13 The Nevada Department of Agriculture recommends PPQ maintain 14 the federal program.
15 I'd like to read a few letters that I will put 16 into the record from Nevada.
The first one is from Jay 17 Harrison, owner of Plant World Nurseries in Las Vegas: 18 "As a member of the Nevada Board of Agriculture, 19 representing the nursery industry, and the owner of Plant 20 World Nurseries in Las Vegas, I support the continuation of 21 the strong federal fire ant quarantine.
22 The Nevada legislature approved additional funding 23 in the last legislative session to help increase prevention, 24 detection, and eradication of imported fire ants.
These 25 funds have helped in the detection of five infestations of 50 1 imported fire ants in Las Vegas last year.
Rapid response 2 to these infestations prevented the establishment and spread 3 of the fire ants.
4 Without maintaining a strong federal quarantine, 5 the number of infestations will increase.
Detection efforts 6 may not discover infestations until they become established.
7 This will increase undesirable effects on the economy, 8 environment, and public health in Nevada.
9 The nursery industry in Nevada aggressively 10 supports a strong federal fire ant quarantine.
It will not 11 accept the position from USDA-APHIS Plant Protection and 12 Quarantine -- that will increase our chances of receiving 13 infested nursery stock.
14 We feel it is our responsibility, along with the 15 Nevada Department of Agriculture, to keep pests that may 16 cause economic, environmental, and public health impact out 17 of Nevada.
Sincerely, Jay Harrison."
18 I have another letter here from the Nevada Pest 19 Control Association: 20 "The Nevada Pest Control Association, Southern 21 Region, supports the continuation of the federal imported 22 fire ant quarantine.
Without maintaining a strong federal 23 quarantine, the odds of the entry and establishment of 24 imported fire ant will dramatically increase.
The 25 establishment of these ants will increase undesirable 51 1 economic, environmental, public health effects in Nevada.
2 The Nevada Pest Control Association, Southern 3 Nevada Region, supports continuation of a strong federal 4 fire ant quarantine in order to prevent undesirable effects 5 they may cause when they become established."
6 I asked John from Colorado, the Western Plant 7 Board president, to poll the Western Plant Board, and the 8 Western Plant Board supports maintaining the quarantine.
9 I have one additional letter that was sent to me 10 to ask me to present on behalf of Oregon, and it reads: 11 "Thank you for the opportunity to comment on 12 Docket Number 00-0008-1, concerning USDA's imported fire ant 13 program.
We would like to urge the USDA to maintain the 14 quarantine and fund a federal cooperative state program that 15 prevents the artificial spread of this pest to uninfested 16 areas.
17 Our position is based on three facts: one, 18 imported fire ant is a serious pest that has negative 19 impacts on human agriculture and native ecosystems; two, 20 large parts of the United States, especially the West, are 21 vulnerable and have not yet become infested; three, fire ant 22 colonies are easily moved in nursery stock and many other 23 commodities that contact the grounds, even the walls of cars 24 and rail trucks.
25 Imported fire ants were intercepted in Oregon in 52 1 railcars full of cottonseed in 1992.
Based on the frequency 2 of interceptions at border stations in California, we 3 suspect that they actually enter our state and other 4 infested states many times a year.
Most of these 5 introductions do not cause problems, but recently discovered 6 infestations in California and New Mexico are proof that 7 long-distance artificial spread can result in establishment 8 in new areas.
9 These newly infested area, far from the leading 10 edge of natural spread, also indicate that the federal 11 imported fire ant quarantine is leaking.
It is probably not 12 a coincidence that the new infestations are on the rise 13 while funding and enforcement has fallen."
14 All of the members of the Nevada Department of 15 Agriculture, the Western Plant Board, believe that the fire 16 ant quarantine for FY 2000 needs to maintained, and we are 17 recommending a fourth option for 2001.
That would be 18 increasing the baseline budget of PPQ by $7.5 million to 19 fund the IFA program.
This will require additional money 20 from Congress, and require that Congress mandate that the 21 money not be redirected to other PPQ programs.
We recognize 22 that PPQ has other higher plant protection priorities with 23 their current funding levels.
24 An increase in global trade, new emerging plant 25 pests, emergency plant protection programs such as Asian 53 1 long-horned beetle in New York, citrus canker in Florida, 2 medfly in California and Florida, and now plumpox in 3 Pennsylvania, have caused PPQ to place an increased emphasis 4 on AQI activities, and have diminished the amount of funds 5 available for domestic plant protection programs.
6 AQI and emerging plant pest programs have 7 rightfully been identified a high priorities within the 8 Agency for the states as PPQ cooperators.
There is still a 9 need, however, for PPQ to maintain an oversight and 10 enforcement in domestic plant protection programs.
11 Therefore, any additional money specifically directed to the 12 Agency as a result of this effort must be directed 13 specifically for imported fire ant quarantine and methods 14 development activity, or they will quickly be targeted by 15 the Agency for AQI emergency plant programs.
16 We feel that $1 million of the $7.5 million -- 17 this is the increase that we believe needs to be put in the 18 program -- should be directed toward implementation of 19 biocontrol for imported fire ants.
There are several things 20 that are being developed that look very promising.
These 21 need encouraging, trial releases, and evaluation.
22 From the short-term standpoint, biological 23 controls are needed in infested areas to reduce the pest 24 pressure that causes natural and artificial spread of 25 imported fire ant.
If the currently high imported fire ant 54 1 pressure can be reduced within the infested area, the need 2 for federal oversight and quality control of domestic 3 quarantine may also be reduced.
4 The Nevada Department of Agriculture and the 5 Western Plant Board thanks USDA-APHIS-PPQ for the 6 opportunity to comment on this and offer our complete 7 cooperation in developing an adequately funded program.
8 The identification of USDA funding for IFA 9 program -- for the USDA programs, we recommend $1.3 million 10 for quarantine and oversight, 100,000 for information and 11 outreach, 100,000 for investigation of violations, and 12 $1 million for development of biocontrol.
For state 13 programs, we recommend a funding of $3 million, and for 14 quarantine enforcement and monitoring, we recommend 15 $2 million, for a total of $7.5 million.
16 I firmly believe this is not the time to stop this 17 program, when we have new chemical tools, new biological 18 tools on the horizon.
I think we can prevent it from 19 becoming established in the western states, and can actually 20 slow the spread in the future.
Thank you.
21 MR. MILBERG: Mr. Gronowski, I have a question.
22 You mentioned John in Colorado supported the -- I think as 23 president of the Western Plant Board -24 25 MR. GRONOWSKI: He took a poll.
MR. MILBERG: I'd like just to get his full name 55 1 for the record, that's all.
2 3 4 MR. GRONOWSKI: Slipped my mind.
MR. MILBERG: Gerhardt, is that right? MR. GRONOWSKI: Gerhardt.
John Gerhardt took a 5 poll of the Western Plant Board members, and no dissension, 6 no dissension at all, to continue the quarantine.
7 MR. MILBERG: And for the reporter, that's 8 G-E-R-H-A-R-D-T.
9 MR. LIDSKY: Thank you.
If you could leave a copy 10 of your -11 12 MR. GRONOWSKI: That's what I intend to do.
MR. LIDSKY: -- statement with Sue McAuley.
Thank 13 you very much.
14 Are there any other persons that may have come in 15 during the recess that were not present earlier that would 16 like to make a statement for the record? 17 18 Please come up, sir.
GARY HAYAKAWA, THREE-STAR NURSERY 19 MR. HAYAKAWA: First of all, I'd like to thank you 20 for the opportunity to speak on this important issue.
My 21 name is Gary Hayakawa, Three-Star Nursery here in Orange 22 County.
I am the legislative chairman for the California 23 Association of Nurserymen.
I also serve on the oversight 24 committee for the county of Orange, representing the nursery 25 industry.
56 1 It will be short and concise.
It's going to be 2 where we feel -- the family business has been in the 3 business for 54 years here in southern California, 25 here 4 in Orange County, and we really feel that, even though we're 5 under the quarantine, we still need to have it, to believe 6 in keeping the ants from spreading, especially up into 7 Northern California.
We need to be able to do the research, 8 with state and local funds as (phonetic) back East and 9 Southeast have the funding there.
10 I believe $7.5 million was mentioned.
I was 11 thinking about 3,000,000, but 7.5 sounds better.
The 12 ability to keep the fire ants at bay in the southeastern 13 states, and not have it spread throughout Oregon and 14 Washington, and just -- you know, coming here into 15 California was bad enough, but to have it even spread even 16 further, this would prevent the action of keeping the 17 quarantine in place.
18 So I, on behalf of the California Association of 19 Nurserymen and a family business, would ask that the 20 quarantine be kept in place, and that $7.5 million would be 21 in place for the research and for the system.
Thank you.
22 MR. LIDSKY: Thank you, sir.
Could you spell your 23 last name for the benefit of the court reporter, please.
24 25 MR. HAYAKAWA: Okay.
It's H-A-Y-A-K-A-W-A.
MR. LIDSKY: Thank you, sir.
57 1 2 3 4 MR. HAYAKAWA: Thank you.
MR. LIDSKY: Any other comments or questions? (No response.)
MR. LIDSKY: I'd like to make some closing 5 remarks.
USDA would like to thank everyone for taking time 6 out of their schedules today to share your comments with us.
7 We've received some very useful information.
We'd like to 8 thank our cooperators that have come in from out of state, 9 and people that have traveled within state.
It's a big 10 state, and we know that for the nursery industry this is a 11 busy time.
So we do appreciate it.
12 The comments that were made here today will be 13 carefully reviewed by the management team of Plant 14 Protection and Quarantine.
That's the Deputy Administrator, 15 Doctor Rick Dunkle, and the regional directors, and other 16 top executives of PPQ.
They'll also be reviewed by the 17 National Plant Board and the Regional Plant Board, as well.
18 We appreciate the unequivocal message that has 19 been sent here today, delivered.
It's very helpful.
Just 20 as a reminder, we'd like to ask you, if you would, to fill 21 out the survey.
Take a minute or two to do that, and, if 22 you have any copies of your testimony, to provide it to 23 Ms. McAuley.
24 Lastly, I'd like to thank Rick Le Feuvre for 25 helping organize this meeting today.
Thank you very much.
58 1 Any comments from any of the other panel members? 2 MR. MILBERG: Well, I'd like to echo your thanks 3 to all the states, Nevada, New Mexico, Arizona, for coming 4 so far to give us your input here, appreciate it.
5 Special thanks to Dan Hammond for getting us the 6 facilities here, and the hotel that we're in.
It's all very 7 nice.
Thank you.
8 MR. LIDSKY: Okay.
Without further ado, we'll 9 adjourn.
Thank you very much.
