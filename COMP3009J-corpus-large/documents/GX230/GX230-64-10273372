BACKGROUND AND
N
EED FOR THE
LEGISLATION
The bill as reported fully authorizes U.S. participation in the modified Heavily Indebted Poor Countries Initiative.
it authorizes the Executive Branch to cancel 100% of the debt owed to the U.S. by up to 45 eligible heavily indebted poor countries.
It urges the President to seek several reforms in the modified HIPC Initiative.
It also provides authorization for U.S. contributions to the World Bank's HIPC Trust, as well as U.S. agreement to mobilizing IMF gold reserves and the transfer of resources from an IMF reserve account to finance the Fund's participation in the modified HIPC Initiative.
It requires the advocacy of certain policies by the U.S. in the international financial institutions, particularly regarding reform of ESAF, and requires the production of several reports by the Secretary of the Treasury.
Relieving the debt burdens of the world's poorest countries is one of foremost economic, humanitarian, and moral challenges of the late 20th century.
Seldom has three been such a compelling conjunction between abstract economics, ethics, and public policy.
In addition, because the Heavily Indebted Poor Countries (HIPC) Initiative represents a uniquely comprehensive approach to debt reduction, multilateral and bilateral issues are interwoven in ways that challenge traditional approaches to foreign policy of all creditor countries.
In this context, the HIPC Initiative raises authorization and policy issues that overlap the jurisdictions of this Committee and the Committee on International Relations.
The Banking Committee is extremely grateful to the International Relations Committee for its gracious cooperation and understanding on this most complex and important subject.
The goal of the H.R. 1095 is simple: to provide faster and deeper debt relief to more countries provided they are committed to reform as well as translating savings from debt relief into poverty reduction and sustainable development.
The Committee on Banking and Financial Services strongly supports international efforts to relieve the debt burdens of the world's poorest countries.
As the president of the World Bank recently observed, more than one billion people around the world still live in extreme poverty.
Nearly 1.4 billion people lack access to clean water.
Approximately three billion live without basic sanitation.
In 1999, 11 million children under the age of five will die of preventable diseases.
For those children who live past five, more than 250 million of them will work instead of going to school.
Yet several hundred million of the world's poor live in countries where crushing foreign debt obligations, almost exclusively to official bilateral and multilateral creditors, stand in the way of economic growth and poverty reduction.
At the request of the GÂ­7 industrial nations for a comprehensive framework to relieve the debt burdens of heavily indebted poor countries, the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund (IMF) proposed the HIPC Debt Initiative in 1996.
The HIPC Initiative is the first coordinated effort to include all creditors, particu-
17 larly the international financial institutions, in addressing the debt problems of poor developing countries.
The goal of the original HIPC Initiative was solely to bring countries' debts to ``sustainable'' levels, meaning that in the future they would be able to make debt payments on time and without rescheduling.
As a condition of receiving the exceptional levels of debt relief provided under the initiative, countries were required to successfully complete as much as six years of economic reform under ESAF.
The World Bank and the IMF originally classified a group of 41 developing countries as heavily indebted poor countries.
The 41 countries are the following: Angola, Benin, Burkina Faso, Burundi, Cameroon, Central African Republic, Chad, Congo, Cote d'Ivoire, Democratic Republic of the Congo, Equatorial Guinea, Ethiopia, Ghana, Guinea, Guinea-Bissau, Guyana, Honduras, Kenya, Lao PDR, Liberia, Madagascar, Mali, Mauritania, Mozambique, Myanmar, Nicaragua, Niger, Nigeria, Rwanda, Sao Tome and Principe, Senegal, Sierra Leone, Somalia, Sudan, Tanzania, Togo, Uganda, Vietnam, Yemen, and Zambia.
Nigeria was subsequently dropped off the original list.
As introduced, H.R. 1095 would extend eligibility to 4 additional countries: Bangladesh, Cambodia, Comoros, and Haiti.
During Committee markup Nigeria was subsequently added as an additional eligible country.
The original HIPC Initiative, however, failed to fulfill its early promise.
The common refrain was that debt relief was ``too little'' and ``too late.''
As of September 14, 1999, eligibility has been reviewed for 14 countries.
Relief has been agreed to for 7 countries: Bolivia, Burkina Faso, Cote d'Ivoire, Guyana, Mali, Mozambique, and Uganda, yielding debt relief of $3.4 billion in net present value (NPV) terms.
Four countries (Bolivia, Uganda, Guyana and Mozambique) have already received debt relief amounting to an NPV of $2.8 billion.
Preliminary review has been completed for five more countries, Ethiopia, Guinea-Bissau, Nicaragua, Mauritania, and Tanzania.
In response to widespread criticism of the original program, in June 1999 at the GÂ­7 summit in Cologne, Germany, the World Bank and IMF endorsed proposals to modify the HIPC Initiative.
The goal of the so-called ``modified'' HIPC Initiative is to provide faster, broader, and deeper debt relief, while strengthening the links between debt relief and poverty reduction.
In contrast to the original framework, the newly modified HIPC Initiative is designed to increase the safety cushion against unanticipated economic shocks and to increase the probability of a permanent exit from unsustainable debt relief.
Deeper debt relief will be provided through a lowering of the NPV debt-to-export target from 200Â­ 250% to 150%; a lowering of the NPV debt-to-fiscal revenue target for countries with very open economies from 280 to 250% and a lowering of the qualifying thresholds from 40 to 30% (export-toGDP ratio) and from 20 to 15% (revenue-to-GDP ratio).
Similarly, in response to concerns that the original Initiative was insufficiently linked to poverty reduction, the modified HIPC attempts to free up resources for high levels of social spending aimed at poverty reduction through: more generous ``interim'' relief between the decision and completion points; and the introduction of ``floating completion points'' which would shift the focus of assess-
18 ment more towards achievements and outcomes rather than the length of the track record of reform.
Strong performers could reach the completion point earlier by accelerating key reforms while maintaining macroeconomics stability.
It also envisions ``front-loading'' the delivery of debt relief by the international financial institutions (IFIs) on a ``case-by-case'' basis.
On September 29, 1999, President Clinton announced that the U.S. would increase the amount of bilateral debt relief available to eligible countries to 100% of all market-based loans ``when needed to help them finance basic human needs'' and when the money will be used to do so.
This follows agreement at the GÂ­7 summit in Cologne to reduce non-concession debt owed to governments by HIPCs by up to 90% and concessional debt by 100%.
The authorization provided by this legislation is necessary to enable the U.S. to fulfill this commitment.
Creditors may provide relief through several means, such as rescheduling debt payments through lower interest rates, buying back the debt, making debt service payments as they come due, and/or lending new funds on concessional terms to make debt service payments.
Multilateral creditors have said they will not forgive debt outright; instead, they intend to provide debt relief in ways that preserve their preferred creditor status.
The World Bank's participation in the HIPC Initiative is to be funded solely from the Bank's own resources.
Debt relief provided by the Bank takes place primarily through contributions to its HIPC Trust Fund from transfers of net income.
The World Bank's HIPC Trust Fund also receives contributions from the U.S. and other participating creditors that are to be used primarily to help other multilateral development banks, such as the African Development Bank, to finance their share of HIPC debt relief.
Because providing the necessary financing is crucial to turning the promise of the modified HIPC Initiative into reality, the committee included an authorization of such sums as may be necessary for the U.S. contribution to the HIPC Trust Fund.
The IMF is participating in the Initiative through the ESAF/ HIPC Trust, which is to finance both debt relief and the subsidy cost of ESAF loans from 2000 to approximately 2005 (the ``interim'' ESAF).
At the completion point, ESAF grants are deposited into escrow accounts to meet the debt service payments owed to the IMF under a predetermined schedule.
The enhancements to the Initiative agreed to in Cologne will more than double the estimated costs from $12.5 billion to about $27 billion in NPV terms, divided roughly between bilateral and multilateral creditors.
Of this, the costs to the Bank would amount to about $5 billion, to the Fund about $2.3 billion, and to other multilateral institutions just under $6 billion.
If Liberia, Somalia, and Sudan are added to the 33 countries thought likely to qualify for HIPC relief, the estimated NPV cost to all creditors would rise to $36 billion.
To fund U.S. participation, the Administration requested $120 million for debt relief programs in FY 2000 (only $70 million of which was HIPC-related).
The amended budget request for FY 2000Â­2004 asked for an additional $850 million.
Of the total $970 million requested for debt relief, $270 is for bilateral relief;
19 $650 is for the World Bank's HIPC Trust; and $50 million is for a debt-for-tropical rainforest initiative.
The Committee applauds U.S.-led efforts to strengthen the linkage between debt relief and poverty reduction.
The new framework agreed to during the World Bank--IMF annual meetings in September 1999 would foster a much closer collaboration between the IMF, the World Bank, recipient governments, and civil society.
The IMF's concessional lending facility and the vehicle for its participation in the Initiative--ESAF--will be required to take into account more fully the potential impact of macroeconomic reforms on programs aimed at poverty reduction and renamed the Poverty Reduction and Growth Facility (PRGF).
Many questions have been raised about the IMF's involvement in concessional lending.
The first IMF facility to make concessional loans to low-income countries was the Trust Fund established in 1976, financed primarily by profits on the sale of 25 million ounces of gold by the IMF.
The Trust Fund was terminated in 1981.
Repayments of loans made by the Trust Fund went to the Special Disbursement Account (SDA) and were used to finance the establishment of the Structural Adjustment Facility (SAF) in 1986.
ESAF was established in 1987 and subsequently expanded in 1993.
In 1996, it was decided that the ESAF would be a permanent, rather than a temporary, facility, as the centerpiece of the IMF's strategy to help low-income countries.
ESAF arrangements are made available to eligible low income countries, those with a per capita GDP of $925 or less and eligible for borrowing under the International Development Association (IDA), that agree to three-year macroeconomic structural and reform plans.
According to the IMF, key to the arrangements are Policy Framework Papers (PFPs), which are drafted by the debtor governments in collaboration with the staffs of the IMF and world Bank.
Loans under the ESAF carry an annual interest rate of 0.5%, with repayments made semiannually, beginning in 51/2 years and ending 10 years after disbursement.
Resources to finance lending in support of ESAF arrangements-- which consist of loans and subsidy contributions--are administered by the IMF through the ESAF Trust.
The trust conducts its operations through three accounts: the Loan Account, to administer the funds needed for trust loans; the Subsidy Account, to subsidize the rate of interest paid by borrowers on loans from the trust; and the Reserve Account, to secure lenders' claims on the trust.
The Loan Account has received its resources from loans made to the IMF by 12 countries at market rates.
The subsidy Account has received grants from 33 countries (including a U.S. contribution in FY 1995 of $75 million), plus some funds from the SDA. Reflows (repaid loans) from SDA-financed SAF and ESAF loans go to the Reserve Account, which will become available for future concessional operations when balances exceed the amount owed to the creditors (about $4.3 billion by early 2007), or as agreed by the creditors.
The ESAF and other so-called ``Administered Accounts'' are legally and financially separate from all other accounts of the IMF.
They represent resources held by the Fund for purposes, such as financial and technical assistance, that are consistent with the Fund's Articles.
20 The Committee is cognizant of the controversy surrounding the IMF's involvement in the HIPC initiative.
The IMF has been at the center of international debt workouts since the early 1980's.
Its relationship to debtor and creditor countries, as well as other international financial institutions managing sovereign debt workouts, is analogous to a ``hub and spoke.''
During the Latin American debt crisis, the IMF played a key role negotiating economic reform programs with debtor countries and in coordinating the contributions of other creditors groups.
In order to ensure that the debtor is undertaking economic reforms, bilateral creditors insist that the country negotiate an adjustment program with the IMF before it comes to the Paris Club.
If the debtor is a poor developing country, the IMF adjustment program will take the form of ESAF loan.
In the same vein, the original HIPC Initiative required that eligible countries successfully complete two successive ESAF programs in order to receive full debt relief.
The IMF projects that by the end of this year the ESAF Trust will reach its cumulative lending target of SDR 10.1 billion, precluding new lending.
The ``Interim'' ESAF would continue IMF concessional lending until the ``self-financed'' ESAF or its successor facility begins operations sometime between year 2005 and 2007.
The Interim ESAF faces a funding shortfall for loan principal of between SDR 5Â­7 billion.
The IMF has not yet identified a source for the principal of ESAF loans.
It could seek new loans from bilateral creditors or subsidize the interest rate on three year loans (``extended arrangements'') made from the IMF's ordinary resources (the General Resources Account).
The ESAFÂ­HIPC Trust, which is separate from the ``interim'' ESAF, was established in February 1997, to finance both ESAF grants (for debt service payments) under the HIPC Initiative and interim ESAF subsidy operations.
Disbursements to fund the IMF contribution to the HIPC Initiative have already begun, pre-financed by transfers from the Reserve Account (with the permission of creditors).
The ESAFÂ­HIPC Trust currently faces a funding shortfall of $3.5 billion (in present value terms).
About $2.3 billion is needed for HIPC operations, and about $1.2 billion for Interim ESAF subsidies.
The resources of the ESAFÂ­HIPC Trust (apart from the principal amount of Interim ESAF loans) are to be derived primarily from a combination of bilateral contributions (including foregone SCAÂ­2 refunds) and the income on profits from the proposed sales of gold.
Two main criticisms have been leveled against ESAF.
First is the charge that it has applied inappropriate and counterproductive ``austerity'' policies in developing countries.
In this regard, the 1980's and the early 1990's were a difficult period for low-income developing countries, particularly those in Africa.
Per capita incomes stagnated or declined.
This led many observers to question the effectiveness of the remedies embodied in IMF-supported adjustment programs--especially those backed by ESAF.
Criticisms of ESAF have continued in the context of the HIPC debt initiative, which conditions debt relief on adherence to ESAF-supported programs.
Second, some critics suggest that ESAF represents IMF represents IMF ``mission creep'' into areas of development assistance that are properly the domain of the World Bank and other multi-
21 lateral development banks.
On the other hand, ESAF supporters point out that the world's poorest countries cannot afford IMF balance of payments support at market rates of interest, and that any fund lending operations to such members countries should properly be concessional.
Proposals for a ``reformed ESAF'' and a new ``poverty reduction and growth strategy'' were unveiled at the IMF--World Bank annual meetings in September 1999.
Under the new strategy, the design of IMF-supported macroeconomic policies would take more fully into account their potential impact on social and sectoral programs aimed at poverty reduction while ensuring macroeconomic stability.
The new approach envisions much closer interaction with the World Bank in order to make the linkage to poverty reduction an operational reality.
Similar to previous Bank-Fund efforts to produce a ``policy framework paper,'' EASF lending operations would be guided by a comprehensive Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper (PRSP) prepared by the national authorities with assistance from the World Bank, the IMF and others.
The PRSP would have to be endorsed by the Executive Boards of both the World Bank and the IMF.
ESAF performance measures would explicitly incorporate a set of key poverty reduction targets set out in the PRSP.
According to Treasury Secretary Summers, adoption of these reforms ``marks a profound change which will put poverty reduction at the center of IMF and World Bank supported programs in HIPC and other low income countries.''
During the World Bank--IMF annual meetings this September, agreement was reached on the main elements of a financing package that would allow the IMF to mobilize a portion of its gold reserves to contribute to the HIPC Initiative and to continue ESAF operations through at least 2005.
The total to be financed is $3.5 billion in 1998 present value terms, and is largely composed of bilateral contributions made by member countries as well as the use of the investment income on the sale of a portion of up to 14 million ounces of the IMF's gold reserves.
Bilateral pledges are $1.4 billion in present value terms while contributions from the IMF total $2.1 billion.
Because legal title to the gold resides with the Fund, IMF gold sales do not have any budgetary implications for the U.S. and no appropriations is required.
Under the Bretton Woods Agreement Act, however, authorization is required for any gold sale that is to be used for the benefit of a single member or a particular segment of the IMF's membership.
Because member countries have not pledged enough to fully fund both debt relief and ESAF, use of IMF resources has become an integral part of the overall financing package.
In this regard, the Treasury Department has requested congressional authorization for: (1) approval of off-market sales of up to 14 million ounces of IMF gold, with the transfer of the earnings on the invested profit from the sale to the ESAF; and (2) making available to the ESAFÂ­ HIPC Trust Fund about $300 million attributable to U.S. participation in a now unneeded IMF reserve account called the Special Contingency Account Number 2 (SCAÂ­2).
These authorizations were included in H.R. 1095, as amended.
The IMF originally proposed to sell at public auction between 5Â­ 10% of its gold holdings to finance debt relief and ESAF.
The IMF
22 would retain the book value of the gold.
The net proceeds of sale would be transferred to the Special Disbursement Account (SDA) and be invested in low-risk securities.
The interest earnings would be used to finance IMF participation in the HIPC Initiative.
The grants for HIPC and interest rate subsidies for the ``Interim'' ESAF would be provided through the ESAFÂ­HIPC Trust Fund.
But with the price of gold hovering around historic lows of $250 an ounce throughout much of 1999, vehement opposition by the gold industry and key Members of Congress eventually forced Treasury and the IMF to consider alternative ways of mobilizing IMF gold reserves.
The new plan is for the IMF to sell up to 14 million ounces of gold without having an impact on the gold market.
In essence, it is a complicated way to revalue the IMF's gold.
There are two parts to the transaction.
The first part is that the IMF would sell gold at the market price to one or more member countries that have obligations due to the Fund.
The Fund would then receive the full proceeds of the gold sales in foreign currency.
It would keep the book value, which is SDR 35 per ounce, on the balance sheet of its main capital account (the General Resources Account or GRA) and transfers the profits--the difference between the book value and the realized price--to an account called the Special Disbursement Account (SDA).
The profits would then be invested and earn interest over approximately the next 18 years.
The interest earnings would be transferred to the ESAFÂ­HIPC Trust and used for financing HIPC as well as interest rate subsidies for loans made by the Interim ESAF.
In the second part, the Fund would simultaneously agree to accept the same amount of gold, valued at the same price, in repayment for obligation coming due.
There would be no sale in the market; the gold would be available to the member only to settle its obligations and thus would effectively remain in the IMF.
It is expected that the profits would eventually be returned to the GRA.
The IMF holds 103.4 million fine ounces of gold.
It values its gold at SDR 35 per ounce (about $48 per ounce).
Under its amended charter, there are significant legal limitations on IMF transactions in gold.
The Fund can only sell gold on the basis of market prices.
It may accept gold to discharge a member's obligations to the IMF.
But it cannot engage in gold leasing or gold lending, enter into gold swaps, utilize gold options or other transactions (including a pure revaluation) that do not involve the transfer of ownership of the gold.
Any IMF transactions in gold require an 85% majority of the total voting power of the Fund.
Because the United States has a 17.5% share of the IMF's voting power, it could unilaterally block a gold sale.
The IMF's gold is held in the GRA.
The book value of any sales must remain in the GRA (thus increasing the capacity of the IMF to generate income through loans).
The profits must be placed in the SDA. Use of SDA assets for concessional assistance to developing members is permitted, in contrast to the general prohibition of such targeted use of GRA resources, if approved by an 85% majority.
The Fund currently invests the assets held in so-called ``administered accounts,'' such as the ESAFÂ­HIPC Trust and the SDA (which holds the profits of the gold sales), in SDR-denominated deposits at the Bank for International Settlements.
23 In 1995, the IMF's Executive Board adopted a policy on gold.
The policy contains the following principles: (1) any mobilization of IMF gold should avoid weakening its overall financial position; (2) the IMF should continue to hold a relatively large amount of gold among its assets; (3) the IMF has a responsibility avoid causing disruptions to the functioning of the gold market; and (4) the profits from any gold sales should be retained, and only the invested income used for IMF operations.
The IMF has established Special Contingency Accounts (SCAs) in the GRA to serve as precautionary balances on certain IMF lending.
Resources for these SCAs are obtained by increasing the rate of charge to borrowing countries and decreasing the rate of remuneration to lending countries.
The SCAÂ­2 has accumulated the SDR 1 billion (about $1.4 billion) that it was designed to achieve, and no further funding is required.
Contributions to the SCAÂ­2 are to be returned to Members when no longer required for their original purpose.
The U.S. share is SDR 220 million or about $300 million.
In order to ensure that none of the earnings on the invested profits of IM gold sales will be used to finance ESAF, the Committee conditioned the authorization for the U.S. to consent to the arrangement on the creation of a separate sub-account for the interest earnings and that the earnings may only be used to finance the IMF's contribution to debt relief under the modified HIPC Initiative.
A similar requirement was established of the transfer of funds from the SCAÂ­2 to the ESAF/HIPC Trust.
Under the Bretton Woods Agreements Act, as amended (Sec. 22 U.S.C. 26(c)), congressional authorization is required for the U.S. to approve the proposed IMF gold sales.

Waters ensuring that countries that support or condone the practice of slavery will not be eligible to receive bilateral debt relief; (5) an amendment offered by Rep. Waters (as modified by Rep. Watt) requiring the Secretary of the Treasury to provide or arrange for technical assistance to countries regarding the establishment and management of Human Development Funds; (6) an amendment offered by Rep. Frank (as modified by Rep. Watt) providing that in carrying out bilateral debt relief under the Act, the President should seek to leverage scarce foreign assistance dollars and give priority to those heavily indebted poor countries with demonstrated need and the capacity to use such relief effectively; (7) an amendment offered by Rep. Campbell stating the sense of the Congress providing that future bilateral assistance to poor countries receiving debt relief should be in the form of grants only; (8) an amendment offered by Rep. Bentsen to include in an annual reporting requirement an additional requirement that Congress be advised on country compliance and accomplishment in achieving poverty reduction reform goals under the Act; (9) a technical amendment offered by Rep. LaFalce to the certification language on IMF gold sales; (10) and amendment offered by Rep. Sherman inserting a requirement that Southeast Asian countries receiving debt relief cooperate in POW/MIA recovery efforts; (11) an amendment offered by Rep. Maloney inserting the country's record on female genital mutilation as a consideration in granting bilateral debt relief; (12) an amendment offered by Rep. Waters stating that the amount of debt relief provided to a country under the modified HIPC Initiative should be sufficient to ensure that the size of the country's outstanding debt does not exceed the value of its annual exports; (13) an amendment offered by Rep. Waters stating that the amount of debt relief provided to a country under the modified HIPC Initiative be sufficient to reduce the country's annual debt service payment to no greater than ten percent of the country's annual revenues; (14) an amendment offered by Rep. Bachus requiring the U.S. Executive Directors at the IMF and World Bank to abolish ESAF and replace it with a Poverty Reduction and Growth Facility; and (15) an amendment offered by Rep.

S ECTION-BY
-SECTION ANALYSIS OF THE DEBT RELIEF REDUCTION ACT OF 1999
FOR
POVERTY
Sec. 1.
Short title this section designates the bill as the ``Debt Relief for Poverty Reduction Act of 1999''.
Sec. 2.
Actions to provide bilateral debt relief and procedures for new loans, credits, and guarantees Subsection (a) amends the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 (``the Act'') by adding new sections 901Â­907.
Sec. 901--Cancellation of Debt.
Section 901(a) amends the Act to require the President to cancel, prior to September 30, 2004, all amounts owed to the U.S. or any agency thereof by eligible countries described in section 902 as a result of concessional loans made or credits extended prior to June 20,1 999.
This section includes bilateral economic assistance, including loans made under Title I of the PL 480 Food for Peace program.
Section 901(b) amends the Act to require the President to cancel, prior to September 30, 2004, all amounts owed to the U.S. or any agency thereof by eligible countries under section 902 as a result of nonconcessional loans, guarantees or insurance, or credits provided prior to June 20, 1999.
This section includes housing guarantees and loans made to finance defense sales under the Arms Export Control Act.
Sections 901(a) and 901(b) are subject to amounts provided in advance in appropriations acts.
Section 901(c) amends the Act by requiring the U.S. to provide immediate relief form debt service payments with respect to amounts owed to the U.S. for which debt cancellation is
33 to be provided beginning on the date on which the country is determined to be so eligible under sec. 902 so long as the country remains in compliance with the eligibility criteria and maintains the link to poverty reduction described below.
None of the provisions of sec. 901 are intended to apply to the U.S. Overseas Private Investment Corporation.
Sec. 902--Eligible Countries.
Section 902(a) amends the Act by establishing eligibility criteria for cancellation of debts owed to the Untied States, First, the President must be satisfied that the country is performing satisfactorily under an economic program.
Second, as of December 31, 2000, the country must be eligible to borrow from the International Development Association (the concessional lending facility of the World Bank Group) and must be ineligible to borrow from the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development (the market rate lending facility of the World Bank Group) or is Nigeria.
If the country meets the general eligibility criteria established above, it must also meet one of two indebtedness tests.
Section 902(a)(3)(A) defines an indebtedness test that would make the original 41 HIPC countries including Bangladesh, Cambodia, Comoros, and Haiti eligible for U.S. debt cancellation.
Section 902(a)(3)(B) states the revised debt sustainability targets agreed to by the GÂ­7 at Cologne in June 1999.
However, the determination of country eligibility under Section 902(a)(3)(B) is to be made by the President and is not linked to the modified HIPC Initiative.
Current estimates are that between 33Â­37 countries will ultimately qualify for enhanced relief under the Cologne criteria.
Section 902(b) establishes six exceptions to country eligibility: (1) excessive military spending; (2) support for acts of international terrorism; (3) failure to cooperate on international narcotics control matters; (4) gross violations of internationally recognized human rights; (5) support for the practice of slavery or failing to make a concerted effort to eradicate the practice; or (6) if the country is located in Southeast Asia and is failing to fully cooperate with the U.S. on POW/MIA issues.
Section 902(c) establishes an additional requirement to strengthen the linkage between debt relief and poverty reduction.
Eligible countries have the choice of either establishing this linkage, through transparent and participatory processes, through one of two mechanisms: a Human Development Fund or Integrated Poverty Reduction Strategy.
Section 902(c)(1) elaborates the requirements for Human Development Fund (HDF), the resources of which shall be dedicated reducing poverty and expanding access to the poorest members of society to basic social services, including education, health, clean water, and sanitation.
There is no requirement that the country be performing satisfactorily under IMF or World Bank economic and social reform programs.
Section 902(c)(2) elaborates the requirements of an integrated strategy for poverty reduction, developed in cooperation with the World Bank and IMF.
On the request of the country, the Secretary of the Treasury is required to provide or otherwise arrange for technical assistance to the country to help establish and manage a HDF.
Similarly, the Secretary is urged to encourage the international financial institutions to provide funds for the country to hire technical assistance
34 in the establishment and management of the HDF.
Section 902(d) defines the modified HIPC Initiative.
Sec. 903--Priority.
This section provides that in carrying out debt relief under the Act, the President should seek to leverage scarce foreign assistance dollars and give priority to those heavily indebted poor countries with demonstrated need and the capacity to use such relief effectively.
Sec. 904--Special Provisions.
Section 904(a) provides that a cancellation of debt under section 901 shall not be considered to be assistance for any provision of law that limits assistance to a country, except as the President may determine for reasons of national security.
Section 904(b) states that the authority to provide for debt cancellation may be exercised notwithstanding sec. 620(r) of the Act, which provides that no recipient of a loan made under the Act shall be relieved of liability for the repayment of any part of the principal of or interest on such loan.
Section 904(c) states that cancellation of debt under section 901 is an additional authority and does not limit the authority to cancel debt under any other provision of law.
Section 904(d) states that in exercising the authority under sec. 901, the President shall take into account the country's record on child labor and workers rights.
Section 904(e) further states that in exercising his authority under section 901, the President shall take into account the country's record with regard to female genital mutilation.
Sec. 905--Annual Reports to Congress.
This provision requires the President to issue a comprehensive public report to the appropriate congressional committees regarding U.S. bilateral debt relief for eligible heavily indebted poor countries.
The report shall be completed by not later than December 31 of each year.
Appropriate committees are the Banking, Appropriations, and International Relations Committees of the House, and the Banking, Foreign Relations, and Appropriations Committees of the Senate.
Sec. 906--Sense of the Congress.
This section states that it is the sense of the Congress that the amounts that would otherwise be provided by the U.S. for development aid or other debt relief should not be reduced on account of any appropriations made pursuant to section 907.
Sec. 907--Authorization of Appropriations.
For the cost (as defined in section 502(5) of the Federal Credit Reform Act of 1990) of the cancellation or reduction of any debt under section 901 of this Act, the section authorizes to be appropriated to the President such sums as may be necessary for each of the fiscal years 2000 and 2001.
(b) Annual Report on Paris Club Debt Rescheduling Actions and Cancellations.
This provision requires an annual report by the Secretary of the Treasury on Paris Club debt restructuring actions and cancellations shall be prepared no later than Jan. 1, 2000.
The report submitted to Congress shall contain (1) a description of debt restructuring actions and cancellations undertaken the U.S. in the Paris Club for the prior fiscal year and (A)(i) describe the amount of debt restructured with respect to each member country; (ii) the new maturity of each such debt restructured; (iii) the new interest rates and other costs of such restructured; (iv) any other terms and conditions of each such debt restructured; and (B) an assessment
35 of the debt restructuring, including an assessment of the effect of the restructuring on the debt service payments of the debtor country; and (2) a description of all amounts owed to the U.S. Government by foreign countries as a result of loans, guarantees or insurance, or credits extended.
(c) Cancellation of Debt Owed to the Export-Import Bank or the Commodity Credit Corporation.--Subsection (c)(1)(A) states that subject to amounts provided in advance in appropriations Acts, the President shall cancel all amounts owed to the Ex-Im Bank of the U.S. by each country eligible for debt reduction as a result of loans, guarantees, or insurance, provided prior to June 20, 1999.
This provision covers the Export-Import Bank and the Commodity Credit Corporation.
Subsections (c)(2)Â­(c)(4) repeat provisions on country eligibility, exceptions, and in the Foreign Assistance Act.
Section (c)(5) defines the ``modified HIPC Initiative.''
Subsections (c)(6)-- (c)(8) restate the funding priority, requirement on child labor and workers rights, and female genital mutilation as in sections 903 and 904 amending the Foreign Assistance Act.
Subsection (c)(9) states that the authority to reduce debt is an additional authority.

Sec. 3.
Actions to improve the provision of multilateral debt relief and procedures for new lending Section 3 adds new sections 1623--1625 to amend title XVI of the International Financial Institutions Act.
36 Sec. 1623--Improvement of the Heavily Indebted Poor Countries Initiative; Ensuring Equitable Burden Sharing.
Section 1623(a) urges the President to commence efforts to accomplish the following modifications in the HIPC Initiative: (1) de-linking debt reduction from IMF programs; (2) promoting poverty alleviation and environmental protection; (3) revising the Cologne eligibility criteria to include Nigeria; (4) requiring as a condition of debt relief an action plan for human development that includes a HDF; (5) requiring as a condition of debt relief a requirement that Southeast Asian countries cooperate with the U.S. on POW/MIA issues; (6) requiring a natural resources development plan, which (A) covers at least a 5-year period for the development of the country's natural resources in a manner that will benefit the people of the country, (B) includes provisions for transparency of government contracts with foreign or multinational corporations, and (c) provides technical assistance from the IFIs to countries in developing such plans and negotiating or renegotiating contract with foreign or multinational corporations for the development of natural resources; (7) provides an amount of debt reduction sufficient to reduce the net present value of country's debt to less than 100% of its annual exports and annual debt service payments not greater than 10% of government revenues; (8) provides greater transparency and participation in HIPC decision making; (9) fosters additional or faster relief for countries with a sustained commitment to poverty reduction and special consideration for a country emerging from civil conflict or that has recently suffered a natural disaster; (10) requires an external assessment of the modified HIPC Initiative, including the reformed ESAF as it relates to that Initiative, by December 31, 2001; and (11) terminating of the HIPC Initiative when all contemplated debt relief is accomplished.
In addition, a freestanding provision is added stating that on the request of the country, the World Bank should provide technical assistance to the country regarding the establishment and management of the HDF. Sec. 1623(b)--Promotion of Equitable Burden Sharing.--This subsection urges the President to commence efforts to ensure that creditors draw upon their own resources to finance debt reduction under the modified HIPC Initiative without diverting funds from other high priority poverty alleviation programs.
Sec. 1623(c)--Contributions to the HIPC Trust Fund.--This subsection authorizes such sums as may be necessary for the World Bank's HIPC Trust Fund, but only for the purposes of debt relief, for FY 2000Â­2004, except that no sums are authorized for such purpose for the fiscal year unless the President determines that, during the preceding fiscal year (1) satisfactory progress was made in accomplishing improvements in the HIPC Initiative and (2) the United States' contributions to multilateral debt relief under the Initiative were matched, by a ratio of at least two to one by resources provided in the aggregate by all other donors.
Sec. 1623(e)--Report to Congress.--This subsection requires that not later than December 31 of each year, the President shall submit to the appropriate congressional committees a public report on the progress made in reforming the HIPC Initiative and achieving multilateral debt relief.
37 Sec. 1623(f)--Definitions.--This subsection repeats the definition of ``modified HIPC Initiative'' and ``decision point.''
Sec. 1624--Reform of the Enhanced Structural Adjustment Facility.
This section requires the Secretary of the Treasury to instruct the U.S. Executive Directors at the World Bank and IMF to use their voice and vote to promote the establishment of poverty reduction strategy policies and procedures at those institutions which have the following components: (1) the development of country-specific poverty reduction strategies, that (A) will be set out in poverty reduction strategy papers (PRSPs); (B) will reflect the relevant expertise of the World Bank and IMF; (C) will make Fund and Bank advice and operations fully consistent with the objectives of poverty reduction and broad-based growth; (D) should include a participatory poverty assessment, social impact assessments, a balance between poverty reduction and macroeconomic objectives, and transparent budget procedures; (2) the adoption of periodic comprehensive reviews of ESAF and IDA programs; (3) the publication of PRSPs; (4) the establishment of a standing evaluation unit at the IMF, similar to the Operations Evaluation Department at the World Bank, that would report directly to the Executive Board of the Fund and that would undertake periodic reviews of IMF operations, including ESAF, with all such reports released promptly to the public; (5) the promotion of simpler and clearer conditionality in IDA and ESAF programs; (6) the reform of ESAF programs that are consistent with the Poverty Reduction Strategies; (7) policies that ensure that IDA lending operations in HIPC countries are consistent with the Poverty Reduction Strategies; (8) strengthening the linkage between borrower country performance and lending operations by IDA and ESAF; (9) the full public disclosure of the proposed objectives, financial organization and operations of the successor to ESAF at least 90 days before any decision by the Executive Board to consider its adoption; and (10) the abolishment of ESAF, and its replacement with a Poverty Reduction and Growth Facility, which will be a subordinate part of a new approach to defining the economic framework for low-income countries.
Sec. 1625--Transparency and Participation of Civil Society in new IFI Lending.
This section requires the Secretary of the Treasury to instruct the U.S. Executive Directors at the international financial institutions to use their voice and votes to vigorously encourage their respective institutions to adopt transparency and other measures to facilitate participation of civil society in developing countries in the design of poverty reduction strategies and in decisions to borrow from such institutions in support of such strategies, including: (1) the disclosure of Policy Framework Papers, Public Expenditure Reviews, Country Assistance Strategies, IMF Letters of Intent, appraisal documents and other similar reports; and (2) the provision of detailed information to the Board of Directors of such an institution and to the public, prior to the approval of a lending operation for a developing country, as to the nature and extent of civil society participation in the design of, and approval process for, such operation.
38 Sec. 4.
Enhanced Structural Adjustment Facility/HIPC Trust Fund Section 4 amends the Bretton Woods Agreements by adding at the end the following new Section 62.
Sec. 62--Approval of Contributions to the ESAF/HIPC Trust Fund.
Subsection (a)(1) authorizes the Secretary of the Treasury to instruct the U.S. Executive Director of the IMF to vote to approve the sale of up to 14 million ounces at a market-related price to a member of members that have large repayment obligations to the IMF.
Simultaneously, the IMF agrees to accept the same amount of gold, valued at the same market-related price, in settlement of some or all of the member's repayment obligations.
It is the Committee's understanding that under the mechanics of the contemplated transaction, the IMF's gold would be available to the member only to settle its obligations and thus would effectively remain in the IMF's possession.
This provision further requires that the earnings on the invested profits of such sales be placed within a separate subaccount within the ESAF/HIPC Trust, and used only for providing debt relief from the Fund under the modified HIPC Initiative.
Subsection (a)(2) authorizes the U.S. to support the transfer of resources from the SCAÂ­2 to the ESAF/HIPC Trust, including some $330 million attributable to the United States, which funds shall be used only for debt relief.
Section 62(b) adds a requirement that within 15 days after the U.S. Executive Director consents to mobilizing IMF gold holds and the SCAÂ­2 transfer, the Secretary of the Treasury shall certify to the appropriate congressional committees that: (1) the IMF's estimate of the net present value of the interest earnings on the total amount of gold sold shall not be greater than the net present value of the costs of the Fund's participation in the modified HIPC Initiative; (2) the interest earnings on the invested profits shall be deposited in a separate subaccount and used only for debt relief from the Fund under the Initiatives; and (3) any funds attributable to the U.S. participation in the transfer of resources from SCAÂ­2 shall be used only for debt relief from the Fund under the Initiative.
Sec. 5.
U.S. international financial agreements; transmission to Congress Section 5 amends Sec. 112b of Title 1, U.S.C., the so-called ``Case Act,'' to require the Treasury Department to transmit to the House and Senate Banking Committees a copy of any international financial agreements entered into by the government of the United States.
The Committee is seriously disturbed that the Department of the Treasury has failed to notify it of international financial agreements, most recently the renewal of the North American Framework Agreement.
This provision is intended to remedy that egregious lack of consultation and notice with this Committee and, more generally, the Congress as a coequal branch of government on fundamental issues of U.S. international economic and financial policy.
Sec. 6.
Corruption in foreign governments Subsection (a) states the Sense of the Congress with respect to U.S. government policies to prevent money laundering and systemic corruption in other countries, and (b) amends Title XV of the
39 International Financial Institutions Act to add a new section 1504.
Section 1504 requires the Secretary of the Treasury to instruct the U.S. Executive Directors of the multilateral development banks to use aggressively their voice and vote to promote policies that would make their institutions more effective mechanisms for promoting good governance and anti-corruption principles within recipient countries.
An identical statutory provision already applies to the IMF.
Subsection (c) adds an annual reporting requirement on U.S. efforts consistent with the above objectives.
Sec. 7.
Safeguards on the use of IMF resources The Bretton Woods Agreements Act, (22 U.S.C. 286Â­286mm) is amended by adding a new Section 63.
Section 63 requires the Secretary of the Treasury to instruct the U.S. Executive Director at the IMF to use their voice and vote to: (1) require independent audits of central banks on a more systematic basis; (2) ensure such audits occur before IMF financing is disbursed; (3) develop a systematic approach to reducing inappropriate uses of foreign exchange reserves; and (4) strongly encourage countries receiving exceptional levels of financial support to adopt and comply with Fund standards on foreign reserve management.
In the wake of the FIMACO scandal involving efforts by the Central Bank of Russia to mislead the IMF, these provisions reflect the Committee's deep concern that safeguards should be significantly strengthened on the use of IMF resources by borrowing countries.
Sec. 8.
U.S. lending policies toward countries receiving debt relief This section of the bill requires the GAO to prepare a report on efforts to ensure that the lending policies of the U.S. and the IFIs toward countries eligible for debt relief avoid moral hazard and promote economic growth and poverty reduction.
The report shall be submitted to the appropriate congressional committees not later than September 30, 2000.

(11) TERMINATION OF THE MODIFIED HIPC INITIATIVE.--The modified HIPC Initiative shall not terminate until all the debt reduction contemplated by this section has been carried out.
(b) PROMOTION OF EQUITABLE BURDEN SHARING.--In order to promote equitable burden-sharing by bilateral, multilateral, and private creditors under the modified HIPC Initiative, the Congress urges the President to commence immediately efforts to ensure that such creditors draw upon their own resources to finance debt reduction under the modified HIPC Initiative to the extent possible without diverting funds from other high priority poverty alleviation programs.
(c) CONTRIBUTIONS TO THE HIPC TRUST FUND.--For payment to the Heavily Indebted Poor Countries Trust Fund of the Inter-
49 national Bank for Reconstruction and Development, but only for purposes of debt relief, there are authorized to be appropriated to the President such sums as may be necessary for fiscal years 2000 through 2004, except that if, with respect to fiscal year 2001, 2002, 2003, or 2004, the President has not determined that, during the then preceding fiscal year-- (1) satisfactory progress was made in accomplishing the improvements in the HIPC initiative described in subsections (a) and (b); and (2) the United States' contributions to the reduction of multilateral debt pursuant to the modified HIPC Initiative were matched, by a ratio of at least two to one, by resources provided in the aggregate by all other donors, then no sums are authorized to be appropriated for such purpose for the fiscal year.
(d) SENSE OF CONGRESS.--It is the sense of Congress that the amounts that would otherwise be provided by the United States for development aid or other debt relief should not be reduced on account of any appropriations pursuant to subsection (c). (e) REPORT TO THE CONGRESS.--Not later than December 31 of each year, the President shall submit to the Committees on Banking and Financial Services, on Appropriations, and on International Relations of the House of Representatives and the Committees on Foreign Relations, on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs, and on Appropriations of the Senate a report, which shall be made available to the public, on the activities undertaken under this section, and on the progress made in accomplishing the purposes of this section, for the prior fiscal year.
The report shall include a list of the countries that have received debt relief under the original or modified HIPC Initiative, a list of the countries whose request for such debt relief has been denied and the reasons therefor, and a list of the countries whose requests for such debt relief are under consideration.
The report shall also include a description of the extent to which countries that receive debt relief under the modified HIPC Initiative have complied with the requirements described in subsection (a)(4). (f) DEFINITIONS.--In this section: (1) MODIFIED HIPC INITIATIVE.--The term ``modified HIPC Initiative'' means the multilateral debt initiative Â¨presented in the Report of the GÂ­7 Finance Ministers on the Koln Debt IniÂ¨ tiative to the Koln Economic Summit, Cologne, 18Â­20 June, 1999.
(2) DECISION POINT.--The term ``decision point'' means the point in time at which the Executive Boards of the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development and the International Monetary Fund review the debt sustainability analysis for a country and decide that the country is eligible for debt relief under the modified Heavily Indebted Poor Countries Initiative.

REFORM OF THE ENHANCED STRUCTURAL ADJUSTMENT FACILITY.
The Secretary of the Treasury shall instruct the United States Executive Directors at the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development and the International Monetary Fund to use the voice
50 and vote of the United States to promote the establishment of poverty reduction strategy policies and procedures at the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development and the International Monetary Fund which support countries' efforts to honor the commitments as set forth in lending operations under programs developed and jointly administered by the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development and the International Monetary Fund that have the following components: (1) The development of country-specific poverty reduction strategies (Poverty Reduction Strategies) under the leadership of such countries, that-- (A) will be set out in poverty reduction strategy papers (PRSPs) to provide the basis for the lending operations of the International Development Association (IDA) and the Enhanced Structural Adjustment Facility and its successors (ESAF); (B) will reflect the role of the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development in social sector development, structural policies, and poverty reduction, and the role of the International Monetary Fund in macroeconomic issues; and (C) will make the advice and operations of the International Monetary Fund and the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development fully consistent with the objectives of poverty reduction and broad-based growth; and (D) should include-- (i) a participatory poverty assessment, undertaken as a systematic part of the design of the Poverty Reduction Strategy, involving collaboration between the government, civil society, the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development, organizations with expertise in the social sector, including United Nations agencies, and donors, which analyzes, among other things, the economic and social needs of the poor and the policy reforms and public investments that will best address these needs; (ii) social impact assessments, undertaken as a systematic part of the design of the Poverty Reduction Strategy, involving collaboration between the government, civil society, the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development, and organizations with expertise in the social sector, including United Nations agencies, and donors, which analyze the impact of policies implemented under the Poverty Reduction Strategy and related lending operations and which are completed before International Bank for Reconstruction and Development and International Monetary Fund Executive Board consideration of such operations; (iii) explicit consideration of the short- and long-term tradeoffs between alternative policy decisions, such as the distributional, equity, and poverty reduction implications of monetary and fiscal policies or the pace and sequencing of structural reforms;
51 (iv) implementation of transparent budget procedures and mechanisms to help ensure that the financial benefits of debt relief under the modified HIPC Initiative result in increased national expenditures on poverty reduction programs; and (v) monitorable indicators of progress in poverty reduction; (2) the adoption of procedures for periodic comprehensive reviews of ESAF and IDA programs to help ensure progress toward poverty goals outlined in the Poverty Reduction Strategies and to allow adjustments in such programs; (3) the publication of the PRSPs (including social impact assessments) prior to Executive Board review of related programs under IDA and the ESAF; (4) the establishment of a standing evaluation unit at the International Monetary Fund, similar to the Operations Evaluation Department of the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development, that would report directly to the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund and that would undertake periodic reviews of International Monetary Fund operations, including the operations of the ESAF, including-- (A) assessments of experience under the ESAF programs in the areas of poverty reduction, rapid growth, and access to basic social services; (B) assessments of the extent and quality of participation in program design by civil society; and (C) verifications that ESAF programs are designed in a manner consistent with the Poverty Reduction Strategies; and (D) prompt release to the public of all reviews by the standing evaluation unit; (5) the promotion of simpler and clearer conditionality in IDA and ESAF programs that focuses on reforms most likely to support poverty reduction and broad-based growth; (6) the adoption by the International Monetary Fund of policies aimed at reforming the Enhanced Structural Adjustment Facility so that ESAF programs are consistent with the Poverty Reduction Strategies; (7) the adoption by the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development of policies to ensure that International Bank for Reconstruction and Development lending operations in HIPC countries are consistent with the Poverty Reduction Strategies; (8) strengthening the linkage between borrower country performance and lending operations by IDA and the ESAF on the basis of clear and monitorable indicators; (9) full public disclosure of the proposed objectives, financial organization and operations of the successor to the Enhanced Structural Adjustment Facility of the International Monetary Fund at least 90 days before any decision by the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund to consider its adoption; and (10) the abolishment of ESAF, and its replacement with a Poverty Reduction and Growth Facility (PRGF), which will be
52 a subordinate part of a new approach to defining the economic framework for low-income countries, in that the new approach will give to the government of a borrowing country the ability to construct its own comprehensive development strategy, and will allow the borrowing country government, at its sole discretion, to request technical assistance, in creating the comprehensive development strategy, from international institutions, such as the World Health Organization, the Food and Agricultural Organization, the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development, and the International Monetary Fund, and from private organizations, businesses, or civil society organizations.

ADDITIONAL VIEWS Debt relief for heavily indebted poor countries is one of the most important matters before Congress this year.
The governments of these countries have been forced to make drastic cuts in essential social services such as health and education in order to make payments on their debts.
In Mozambique, debt service payments in 1997 absorbed about half of all government revenue or $7 per person, while only $3 per person was spent on health services.
In Tanzania, 1997 debt service payments equaled nine times the spending on basic health services and four times the spending on basic education.
In Nicaragua, over half of the government's revenue was allocated to debt service payments in 1997.
This was equivalent to two and a half times the spending on health and education combined.
H.R. 1095, the Debt Relief for Poverty Reduction Act of 1999, as passed by the Committee on Banking and Financial Services of the House of Representatives, requires the complete cancellation of debts owed by heavily indebted poor countries to the United States and makes substantial improvements in the Heavily Indebted Poor Countries (HIPC) Initiative of the International Monetary Fund (IMF).
The bill requires that poor countries establish Human Development Funds or develop Integrated Poverty Reduction Strategies to target the savings from debt relief to HIV/AIDS treatment and prevention, health care, education and poverty reduction programs.
The bill also includes several amendments that were offered during committee consideration to expand and improve bilateral and multilateral debt relief programs.
THE INCLUSION OF NIGERIA
H.R. 1095 includes an important amendment that I offered to include Nigeria in bilateral and multilateral debt relief programs.
Nigeria is currently in the process of making a transition to democracy and would receive tremendous benefits from debt relief.
Under the authoritarian rule of General Sani Abacha, Nigeria's resources were depleted and the human rights of the Nigerian people were routinely violated.
Now Nigeria is at a turning point and support from the international community could make a crucial difference in Nigeria's future.
Although Nigeria is currently eligible to borrow from the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development, it is a deeply impoverished country.
Nigeria's per capita income is only $300 per year and the country spends no more than $5 per person per year on health services.
Nevertheless, Nigeria owes $871 million in debts to the United States and the country's total debt stock is over $28 billion.
Debt relief will give Nigeria a fresh start and a sound basis for a democratic future.
(55)
56 The United States has a history of providing assistance to countries overcoming crises and building democracies.
Earlier this year, the United States led the world in providing assistance to the people of Kosovo as they struggled against genocide.
The United States also provided considerable economic assistance and debt relief to Poland, other countries in Eastern Europe and the newly independent states of the former Soviet Union following the fall of communism.
Now the United States has an historic opportunity to set an example to the rest of the world and support Nigeria's transition to democracy.
CONDITIONS FOR BILATERAL DEBT RELIEF
I am also pleased that H.R. 1095 includes two amendments offered by Congressman Barney Frank to improve the conditions for bilateral debt relief.
One amendment assures that a country's eligibility for bilateral relief is determined by the government of the United States and does not depend on terms set by the IMF.
The other provides that eligible countries will not have to make payments on their debts while they are implementing policies on which bilateral debt relief is conditioned.
TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE
H.R. 1095 includes important provisions to ensure that technical assistance is available to countries that request it.
Specifically, the bill requires the Secretary of the Treasury to provide or arrange for technical assistance to countries regarding the establishment and management of their Human Development Funds.
The bill also states that Treasury should encourage international financial institutions to provide funds for countries to hire technical consultants.
Finally, the bill states that the World Bank should provide technical assistance to countries that request it.
Many poor countries may not have the technical knowledge necessary to comply with the conditions in this bill.
If poor countries are going to be required to establish Human Development Funds or develop Integrated Poverty Reduction Strategies in order to receive debt relief, it is only reasonable that they be provided technical assistance to enable them to do so.
AMOUNT OF MULTILATERAL DEBT RELIEF
H.R. 1095 includes several provisions to urge the President to commence efforts within the Paris Club of Official Creditors, the IMF and the World Bank to make several important changes in the Heavily Indebted Poor Countries (HIPC) Initiative.
One of these changes would require deeper multilateral debt relief for poor countries.
Specifically, the bill states that the amount of debt relief provided to a country should be sufficient to ensure that the value of the country's outstanding debts does not exceed the value of the country's annual exports.
The bill also states that poor countries should not have to spend more than ten percent of their annual revenues on debt service payments.
57 ELIMINATION OF STRUCTURAL ADJUSTMENT PROGRAMS
H.R. 1095 also urges the President to support the elimination of the requirement that countries complete a structural adjustment program approved by the IMF as a condition for receiving debt relief under the HIPC Initiative.
Under the current HIPC Initiative, poor countries are required to adopt structural adjustment programs as a condition for debt relief and implement them over a sixyear period.
These programs usually require cuts in health care, education and other social services.
Most poor countries have been unable to implement the economic reforms required by these programs.
Many poor countries have become even more impoverished as a result of structural adjustment programs.
Zimbabwe, for example, began implementation of a structural adjustment program in 1991.
Between 1991 and 1996, manufacturing output in Zimbabwe declined by 14% and real gross domestic product (GDP) per capita declined by 5.8%.
Furthermore, spending on health care declined as a share of the budget from 6.4% to 4.3% and as a share of GDP from 3.1% to 2.1%.
The real wages of health care workers in the public sector were reduced, causing many doctors to move to the private sector.
As a result, the quality of public health care dropped and health services became less accessible to the poor.
Government spending on education was also drastically reduced.
Between 1991 and 1994, real per capita expenditures on primary education were cut by 36%.
The inability of poor countries to implement painful structural adjustment programs should not be an impediment to their ability to receive debt relief.
Once poor countries have made a commitment to use the savings from debt relief to provide health care, education and other vital social services to their impoverished populations, they should be able to receive immediate debt relief.
OVERSIGHT PANELS
H.R. 1095 includes a requirement that poor countries establish oversight panels to monitor the use of their Human Development Funds.
The bill also includes a provision to ensure that these oversight panels will be consulted by the IMF and the World Bank in the making of key decisions regarding debt relief in their respective countries and will be given the opportunity to review the published content of these decisions as well as all relevant analytical, legal, and policy documents.
The bill also states that each oversight panel shall include representatives of civil society and a majority of its members shall be citizens of that country.
The oversight panels should include representatives of civil society such as individuals representing labor unions, environmental organizations, human rights organizations, religious organizations, farmers' organizations, women's organizations, indigenous people's organizations and other community organizations.
The oversight panels may also include representatives of UNICEF or other United Nations agencies.
Each oversight panel should review all conditions for debt relief imposed by the United States, other creditor governments, the IMF or the World Bank; all actions of its own government to comply
58 with those conditions, including the establishment and use of the country's Human Development Fund; and all actions by its own government, other creditor governments and all international financial institutions affecting the progress of the country's debt relief program.
The oversight panel should meet regularly to evaluate and report on the progress of the country's debt relief program, and its reports should be made available to the public.
The IMF or the World Bank should provide travel and administrative expenses to each oversight panel to allow the panel to fulfill its functions.
These oversight panels will ensure that debt relief programs will be participatory and transparent and the people that are the most directly affected by these programs will be consulted regarding the conditions for debt relief.
CONCLUSION
H.R. 1095, the Debt Relief for Poverty Reduction Act, as passed by the Committee on Banking and Financial Services of the House of Representatives, will break the cycle of debt and enable the world's poorest countries to invest in health care, education and other essential services for their impoverished populations.
I am proud to support this landmark legislation to wipe away the debts of heavily indebted poor countries throughout the world.
MAXINE WATERS.
DISSENTING VIEWS I am a cosponsor of H.R. 1095, the Debt Relief for Poverty Reduction Act, and have been a consistent advocate for international debt relief in the past.
However, I have two particular concerns about the current version of H.R. 1095 as passed by the House Banking Committee.
Due to my attendance at University of Nebraska Master's Week activities in Lincoln, Nebraska, on November 3, 1999, I was unable to voice these two particular concerns at the Banking Committee markup of H.R. 1095.
My two concerns with the Committee markup of H.R. 1095.
My two concerns with the Committeepassed version of H.R. 1095 are as follows: 1.
I am opposed to the amendment, adopted at the House Banking Committee markup, which provides that Nigera is eligible to receive Highly Indebted Poor Countries (HIPC) debt relief.
My opposition to this inclusion is based upon Nigeria's wealth of oil reserves.
Nigeria is the world's 6th largest exporter of oil, producing over 2.012 million bbl/day (barrels of oil a day).
In addition, given the rise in price in oil over the past year, Nigeria's oil earnings are estimated to be up 29% in 1999 over 1998.
Nigeria's overall bilateral debt to the United States is $871 million.
This equals a mere 22 days of gross oil exports at the current rate of production with the current price of $23/bbl.
Moreover, Nigeria has already received substantial US debt relief.
In 1990Â­91, Nigeria received $64.8 million in bilateral debt cancellation through Section 572 Debt Relief.
Furthermore, Western officials believe that the corrupt government of General Sani Abacha of Nigeria may have stolen over $3.5 billion.
Since Abacha's death, $750 million of this has been successfully recovered from the Abacha family and more than $250 million has been recovered from Abacha's former national security adviser.
This recovery alone ($1 billion) represents $129 million more than Nigeria's outstanding $871 million in bilateral debt to the United States.
On January 25, 1999, Nigeria and the IMF reached an agreement that paved the way for debt rescheduling and the resumption of World Bank funding.
I do believe that the answer for Nigeria is debt rescheduling, which is outside the scope of H.R. 1095, not HIPC debt relief.
Including Nigeria in HIPC will result in the failure of other poor countries in Africa and elsewhere to receive sufficient debt relief.
The choice here, for example, is between Nigeria and Tanzania, Madagascar, Niger or the Central African Republic.
There will not be enough appropriated funds to cover Nigeria and the other HIPC countries.
2.
My second concern regarding H.R. 1095, as amended by the House Banking Committee, relates to Section 903 which sets priorities for providing bilateral debt relief by the United States.
Using the current definition in H.R. 1095, I am concerned that a very deserving Bangladesh, which is one of 45 countries eligible for debt (59)
60 relief under H.R. 1095, will be put at the end of the line for HIPC debt relief.
My concern is based on the limited resources for overall debt relief and suggestions from the Administration that Bangladesh, given its responsible handling of its debt, would not be considered as a priority for debt relief.
I was ready to offer a prepared amendment at the markup, which I was unable to offer for the reason stated above, that would have amended the priority section of H.R. 1095.
This amendment would have required the President to give debt relief priority to the HIPC countries.
Then, after a reasonable two year period, it allows Bangladesh to be equally considered for debt relief with the HIPC countries.
Designating Bangladesh in this manner is justified both because it is one of the few countries that has already undertaken the kind of forward-looking, poverty alleviation and human development reforms called for in H.R. 1095 and it has acted responsibly in paying its debt.
Its failure to receive debt relief previously really is the result of errors and failures: it is deserving but its case has previously ``fallen through the cracks.''
Without my amendment, H.R. 1095 seems to penalize--or at least disregard--one of only a few countries whose actions should serve as a model development partner for other very poor, indebted countries.
Since the House International Relations Committee has subject matter jurisdiction over bilateral debt relief, I plan to offer amendments to remedy my two concerns at a future H.R. 1095 markup by the House International Relations Committee.
DOUG BEREUTER.
DISSENTING VIEWS This bill confirms what opponents of the International Monetary Fund and World Bank have been saying for some time: more money for these institutions is the wrong medicine for a serious problem.
Every dollar the IMF lends to a poor country adds to that country's debt burden.
The IMF policy of lending new money to pay the debt due by a developing country (plus additional interest) is the root of the problem.
Decades of misguided ``development'' policies have resulted in poverty for masses of people and increasing debt burdens for developing countries.
These policies have finally become unsustainable.
The jig is up.
These policies do not work--not for the poor, at least.
For a select few (politically well connected) officials, these policies are working just fine.
According to Macroscope, ``Au Revoir,'' Investor's Business Daily, November 11, 1999, IMF bureaucrats average about $114,000 a year (with staffing growing five percent annually over the past decade).
The agency has more than 80 division directors, each making more than $180,000 a year--plus benefits.
Since 1990, IMF lending has soared by about 100 percent.
Its assets now total more than $80 billion.
These policies work well for them.
IMF largesse feeds corruption in developing countries as well.
The Bank Bali scandal in Indonesia and the ever-unfolding embarrassment in Russia are but the latest examples.
IMF money feeds this endemic corruption that sustains inept governments.
Propping up unpopular governments postpones economic policies that promote growth and prosperity.
These policies then trap the poor in a vicious cycle.
The best way to help the poor and encourage economic growth and prosperity is to end this damaging cycle.
This bill throws more money at the cause of the problem.
Such an approach will only begin a new cycle of indebtedness and renew the poverty trap.
The amendment I offered with Representatives Tom Campbell, Bill McCollum and Walter Jones to sunset the Bretton Woods Act (after three years with a report from Treasury on alternatives after two years) was the best way to stop the cycle of ever-greater debt burdens of poor countries.
Through the IMF and World Bank, we take money from the working poor of rich countries to give to the rich people in poor countries.
The poor everywhere deserve better.
