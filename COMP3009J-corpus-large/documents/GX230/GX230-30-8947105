Mindful that many Alabamians are involved in the actions of all branches of the United States Armed Forces, we wish them Godspeed.
They and their families will be ever in our prayers.
We extend to the families of all those who have lost loved ones in the War On Terrorism, as well as those who suffered from the cowardly, terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001, our prayers for strength and comfort.
