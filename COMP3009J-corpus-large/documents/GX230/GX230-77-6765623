VOCATIONAL EDUCATION Purpose Vocational Education is an essential component of the high school curriculum.
For many students, it represents as much as a third of their high school experience.
It is a critical component in meeting the needs of students in academic achievement, career exploration, career preparation, and leadership development.
Successful transition to postsecondary education, work, or the military is one of the goals of Kentucky's educational system.
The percentage of students making successful transition is a component of the high school accountability index.
High quality vocational education programs are critical in preparing students for further study at the postsecondary level in a technical field or successful entry into the workforce following high school graduation.
Therefore, a well-planned sequence of courses, which is focused on a career cluster, has a positive impact on student achievement during high school and student success following high school graduation.
When high-quality vocational programs are integrated with high-quality academic core content, students understand the relevance of curriculum in preparation for their future.
Employers are demanding that their future employees be able to apply academic and technical skills to real-world problems that are encountered in the workplace.
Occupational outlook information indicates that eighty percent of the jobs will require some level of postsecondary education in a technical field.
Vocational Education at the secondary level is critical in meeting this demand.
Significance to the Individual Graduation Plan The high school graduation requirements include the expectation that all students will develop and follow an Individual Graduation Plan which emphasizes career development.
It is important that a sequence of academic and vocational courses provide students the maximum opportunity to develop academic and technical skills based on their career goals within one of the following career clusters: Agriculture Arts and Humanities Business and Marketing Communication Construction Education Health Sciences Human Services Manufacturing Mining Public Service Science and Math Social Sciences Transportation
It is essential that administrators, guidance counselors, and faculty work together in identifying courses of study that maximize the students' potential for success at the postsecondary level or entry into the workforce based on their career goals.
It is recommended that students develop an Individual Graduation Plan which includes the academic core specified in the graduation requirements and at least four credits within a OCTOBER 1998 VOCATIONAL EDUCATION OVERVIEW 1
career cluster.
Examples of recommended courses of study based on career clusters are included in this document within each of the vocational program area sections.
Planning Vocational Education Programs Vocational education programs and sequences of courses within each program area should be carefully planned in order to maximize the vocational course offerings at any one school.
The decisions about which programs and courses that are provided should be made through consultation with employers, faculty, parents, and students.
In all cases, vocational programs should be offered that meet the needs of the students and the community.
Consideration must be given to offering or providing courses over a two-tothree year period of time, on a rotational basis, in order to maximize the potential for career exploration and preparation for all students.
It is not necessary to offer each vocational course every year, especially the preparatory classes, which students may be taking during their sophomore, junior, and senior year.
More importantly students should have the opportunity to take vocational courses that will prepare them in the area of their career goals.
This document provides a recommended framework of Vocational Education programs and courses appropriate for specific career clusters.
These courses should be selected to complement the required academic courses that prepare students for successful transition to postsecondary education or the workforce within their area of career interest.
Recommended courses are included for each of the following areas: Agriculture Business Education Family and Consumer Sciences Health Sciences Industrial Education Technology Education Marketing Education Pathway to Careers Jobs for Kentucky's Graduates
Schools have the flexibility of offering vocational education courses other than those identified in this document.
However, it is expected that any vocational course offered would be beneficial to a specific career cluster and the content include broad based technical skills applicable to the workplace.
Vocational Student Organizations Vocational Student Organizations (VSO's) are recognized as integral to the vocational education program.
VSO's provide a unique program of career and leadership development, motivation and recognition exclusively for middle/junior high and secondary students enrolled (or who were enrolled) in vocational programs.
It is recommended that all vocational education programs provide access to vocational student organizations.
VSO's are not "clubs" to which only a few vocational students belong.
Rather, a VSO is a powerful instructional tool that works best when integrated into the vocational curriculum and classroom by a vocational instructor who is committed to the development of the total person.
Vocational educators recognize the importance of providing students 2 VOCATIONAL EDUCATION OVERVIEW OCTOBER 1998
with job and career-related training that complements the job-specific skills needed for entry into a particular field.
The Vocational Student Organizations and their related field are: DECA FBLA FFA FHA HOSA TSA VICA Marketing Education Business Education Agriculture Education Family and Consumer Sciences Education Health Occupations Education Technology Education Industrial Technology Education/Secondary and Postsecondary
Vocational Student Organizations are extremely effective as "instructional tools" when used properly by trained vocational educators.
VSO's activities are integral to vocational education when they: a. provide instructional strategies used to develop, improve and expand occupational competencies related to a particular vocational subject matter area; are an extension of the classroom/laboratory instructional program which enriches and enhances classroom/laboratory learning; and present organized activities for students to gain personal and leadership skills making them more employable, preparing them to become productive citizens, and assisting them in assuming positive roles in the home and community.

Vocational Education's Role in Tech Prep, High Schools That Work, and School-toWork: These initiatives are focused on improving student achievement and successful transition to postsecondary education or work following high school graduation.
Some of the key practices which are vital to the success of these initiatives include raising student expectations through a rigorous and relevant curriculum, integration of academics and vocational education, career guidance and planning, articulation to postsecondary education, and work-based learning.
High quality vocational education programs, which are based on industry recognized standards, are critical to the successful implementation of these initiatives.
The content of all vocational education courses should be based on challenging curriculum that provides application of mathematics, science, and communication as it is utilized in the modern workplace.
The technical content of all vocational education programs should be broadbased to prepare students for multiple jobs within an occupational field.
OCTOBER 1998
VOCATIONAL EDUCATION OVERVIEW

One of the expectations of the initiatives is to improve transition to postsecondary education through the development of articulation agreements.
In an effort to provide articulation on a statewide basis, agreements have been developed in the areas of Early Childhood Education, Electronics/Engineering Technology, and Computer Related Instruction.
Schools are encouraged to develop articulation agreements in all technical areas that lead to postsecondary education.
Work-Based Learning Work-based learning provides experience and activities gained in a work-type environment.
Two major categories of work-based learning are school and worksite.
Worksite learnings include cooperative education, entrepreneurship, Kentucky Registered Pre-Apprenticeship, clinicals, practicums, internship and work experience.
These experiences are to correlate with student's career major/cluster.
This correlation is to be a direct relationship between studies in school and the activities at the worksite.
Guidelines for work-site learning: n
Student is to be enrolled in a related class.
On-the-job experience must be correlated with the class instruction.
A training plan is to be developed and on file for each student.
Supervision of the on-the-job experience is to be provided by a teacher or school-to-work coordinator who may represent one program area or multiprogram areas.
The coordinator providing the supervision for multi-program areas is to consult with the respective program area regarding supervision concerns, such as student progress, training plans and problems encountered by students and/or work-site mentors.
Credit is contingent upon two factors: related class and time spent on-the-job during school hours or an equivalent amount of time based on daily work schedules identified in the training plan.
Credit may be awarded for both the related class and work-site experiences.
The credit for work-site experiences may be awarded based on the number of class hours spent at the worksite on an hour-for-hour basis for a maximum of two (2) credits per related class.
(Consultation with the Division of Secondary Vocational Education is needed if there are any exceptions to these guidelines.)

OCTOBER 1998
Meeting The Needs For Learner Diversity In vocational education, provisions must be made to meet the needs for learner diversity in any course in which they are enrolled.
All learners are to be provided with support services to assist them in the successful completion of the program.
"All learners" include students who do not need accommodations or modifications, as well as learners with different needs.
There may be learners with unique needs related to services already provided through:
n n n n n
Gifted and Talented Programs Special Education or 504 Services Title I Programs LEP (Limited English Proficiency) Services Dropout Prevention Services
Provisions are to be based on needs assessments and Individual Graduation Plan.
Student centered planning addresses diversity in learning styles, interest and aptitude.
Effective assessment is utilized in identifying student needs.
Two major areas of support to assist students and teachers in vocational programs include the provision of supplementary services and support personnel.
Support personnel to help meet the needs of diverse populations may include, but not limited to personnel (e.g. tutors, teacher-aides, interpreters, teachers in Vocational Improvement Programs, Technical Liaison Coordinator, Special Populations Coordinator and mentors).
Supplementary services may include special instructional materials, guidance, counseling, coordination, and collaboration with other educational providers, community service agencies and employers.
Vocational Improvement Program (VIP) Supportive Services The Vocational Improvement Program (VIP) is a broad-based support program designed to provide services to individuals with special educational needs who are enrolled in vocational education programs.
The Vocational Improvement Program teacher is assigned students who have been identified through location, evaluation and procedures as required by state/federal regulations for special populations.
The types of services the Vocational Improvement Program teachers will provide for students are to be identified in a student(s) Individual Graduation Plan (IGP) or Individual Education Program (IEP).
Services may include the development of instructional strategies, curriculum modification, vocational assessment, and informal counseling.
Instruction may be provided in the remediation of basic skills necessary for student to function in the vocational program.
The Vocational Improvement Program teacher is to work cooperatively with academic and vocational teachers, guidance counselors, and paraprofessionals in providing in-class assistance to students and teachers.
The amount of time designated for the services of a Vocational Improvement Program teacher is contingent upon the number of students needing services.

AGRICULTURE EDUCATION 1
OCTOBER 1998
AGRICULTURAL SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY OVERVIEW Agricultural Science and Technology Education is designed to provide career exploration, orientation, and preparation for those students who have an interest in some aspect of agriculture.
The knowledge and performance skills required for successful achievement and/or advancement in agricultural occupations constitute the central focus of the program.
Students planning to attend college majoring in any field of agriculture or science would benefit from high school agricultural education.
The agricultural industry has many related occupational fields.
Farming is no longer agriculture's primary occupation.
Currently over 22 percent of all occupations are agriculturally related.
Therefore, it is necessary to provide educational opportunities to students within this rapidly growing occupational field.
Each local Agricultural Education Program should offer courses that meet the needs of students and the local agriculture industry.
It is recommended that courses be offered in various agricultural areas to provide students an opportunity to explore the various fields of agriculture and develop skills within these areas.
Introduction to Agricultural Science and Technology is recommended as the first course students should enroll in as ninth graders; however, it is not required as a prerequisite to enrollment in other agricultural courses.
All courses consist of classroom instruction, related laboratory experiences, and supervised agricultural experience programs (entrepreneur or cooperative on-the-job placement experiences).
Each student enrolled must plan an agricultural experience program that complements the classroom instruction.
Time shall be provided in the daily teaching schedule for both classroom instruction and supervision of experience programs.
See the Work-Based Learning Section in Secondary Vocational Education Work Based Learning Guide for details.
In addition to the general guidelines a Supervised Agriculture Experience (SAE) program can be assessed as an Entrepreneurship work-based experience.
FFA (Future Farmers of America) is the vocational student organization available to students enrolled in agricultural education programs.
The activities of the organization are an integral part of the instructional program.
All students enrolled are encouraged to become members of the FFA and take advantage of the leadership, citizenship, and personal development training offered.
Each approved Agricultural Education Program shall have an active FFA chapter that provides leadership development opportunities for all its members.
Agricultural education teachers shall serve as FFA chapter Advisors.

High School Science Agri-biology Course Overview: This one-credit course uses agricultural contexts to present the life science content outlined in the Program of Studies.
As students study practical agricultural concepts, they apply scientific ways of thinking and working to real-life problems.
During their study of agri-biology, students perform many practical tasks.
They create models, extract DNA, analyze DNA fingerprints, construct tables and graphs to classify and analyze data, and test soils.
Students also participate in cooperative and collaborative groups, use technology to solve problems, and participate in field trips to apply scientific concepts to agricultural and environmental problems.
Students develop an understanding of many concepts such as cell structure and function, morphology and physiology of agriculturally significant animals, heredity principles and inheritance patterns, genetic engineering, animal behavior, biological change, interdependence of plants and animals, and the flow of matter and energy through ecosystems.
Models are organized around guiding questions.
Guiding questions (in bold print) direct teachers' choices of activities and are the questions students should be able to answer at the end of the course.
Essential questions may be included to further focus student learning.
Pages of models are arranged in pairs.
On the left-hand page of each pair are guiding (in bold print) and essential questions along with related academic expectations and correlation to the Program of Studies and agri-biology content chart.

BUSINESS EDUCATION Overview of Business Education As developed by the Kentucky Business Education Task Force, the vision of Kentucky Business Education is to promote business professional development, enhance leadership, provide relevant curriculum, and to be vital to the education of all students.
Kentucky Business Education will: Â· Â· Â· Â· Â· Â· Â· Â· operate as the center for industry standard desktop and communications technology in schools, provide a critical link in school to employment transition, develop stronger relationships with the business community in terms of mutual advocacy, cooperative field experiences, employment placement, and support for FBLA experiences, represent a necessary component in the education of all students, provide a vehicle for the school-to-work transition of students, require and promote critical thinking and problem solving, offer a flexible curriculum based on standards and that adapts to change, and have a broad network of business partnerships.
The Kentucky Chapter of Professional Secretaries International (PSI) and the Business and Marketing Education Branch have developed the skill standards required to obtain an Administrative Support Certificate.
Students may obtain this skill standards certificate by taking four specific business education courses and meeting other criteria which are still being developed.
These standards reflect what employers are looking for when they seek to hire employees and are essential for students to be able to do upon graduation.
Business Economics is an interdisciplinary course which meets the graduation requirement for Economics.
School-based enterprises (banks, publishing companies, etc.) operated by students under the direction of a Business Education Teacher are encouraged and strengthen the student's educational experience.
Computer Applications and Word Processing are courses having statewide articulation agreements.
These agreements provide students with an opportunity to proceed from secondary to post-secondary, technical, and higher education in these computer-related areas in a non-duplicative manner.
Several courses in the Business Education Program Area are cross-referenced with the Marketing Program Area.
Cross-referenced courses are available in both program areas and may be taught by teachers certified in either Business or Marketing Education.
Future Business Leaders of America (FBLA) is the organization for Business Education students.
The cocurricular activities of FBLA must be an integral part of approved business education programs with all students encouraged to become involved in these activities.
These experiences enhance leadership development, promote citizenship, and facilitate the transition from school to careers.
