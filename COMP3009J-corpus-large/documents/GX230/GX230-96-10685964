ARIZONA CROPS February 2001 Released February 8, 2001, by the Arizona Agricultural Statistics Service and University of Arizona, College of Agriculture, 3003 N Central Avenue, Suite 950, Phoenix, Arizona 85012-2994, (602) 280-8850, Fax: (602) 280-8897, www.nass.usda.gov/az/ U.S. ORANGE PRODUCTION DOWN 2% FROM JANUARY The U.S. all orange February 1 forecast of the 2000-01 crop is 12.4 million tons, down 2 percent from January's forecast and 6 percent less than last season's final utilization.
Florida's all orange forecast is 223 million boxes (10.0 million tons), a decrease of 3 percent from the January forecast and 4 percent less than the 1999-2000 final utilization.
The early and midseason orange forecast remains at 127 million boxes (5.72 million tons), 5 percent lower than the previous season.
Although droppage has increased following the cold weather, harvesters are moving into these groves quickly to minimize loss of early and midseason variety oranges.
Florida's Valencia forecast, at 96.0 million boxes (4.32 million tons), is down 6 percent from January and is 3 percent lower than last season's final utilization.
Because of the below average temperatures and precipitation all winter, fruit sizes have been and continue to be below average.
Droppage of fruit was at record low levels before the cold weather but now has increased.
Arizona, California, and Texas orange production forecasts are carried forward from the January forecasts.
Although several mornings of below freezing temperatures occurred in many groves prior to January, the coldest morning affecting nearly all citrus producing areas was on January 5.
Minimum temperatures were recorded for long enough durations to indicate fruit damage and loss would occur.
But because of the below normal temperatures since November and the extensive use of irrigation to mitigate drought conditions and protect against cold weather, fruit damage was limited.
A fruit cut survey conducted approximately two weeks after the coldest weather indicated very little drying of fruit.
Florida frozen concentrated orange juice (FCOJ) yield projection is decreased from 1.55 to 1.54 gallons per box at 42.0 degrees Brix.
The early and midseason portion remains at 1.51 gallons per box, but the late season Valencia portion is decreased from 1.62 to 1.60 gallons per box.
Although pounds of solids per box continues to increase, Valencia pounds of juice per box has decreased slightly, indicating some drying of fruit from the cold weather.
