Condition of Coral Reefs The long-term datasets for the USVI represent some of the best temporal data available for the Caribbean (Connell 1997).
Although monitoring and research has occurred on all three USVI islands, consistent long-term datasets exist only for St. John and Buck Island, St. Croix (e.g. 1988 to present) and have been collected primarily by the Department of the Interior, National Park Service (NPS) and U.S. Geological Survey (USGS).
Most of these studies are targeted in individual bays that might not be representative of conditions within the entire USVI (Table 1).
Corals and Other Invertebrates
additional site on St. John has eight nonrandomly located transects which have been sampled for three years.
Live scleractinian coral cover varies at these sites from a low of 5.8% (Buck Island, St. Croix) to a high of 22.8% (Mennebeck, St. John). .
It should be noted that the site with non-randomly located transects has a live scleractinian coral cover of 45.3% (Tektite, St. John).
Results of the repeated sampling are varied but overall, 76% of transects showed declines in the amount of live coral cover when the first year is compared to the third year.
Percent of transects exhibiting declines at individual sites are as follows: 40% (Yawzi, St. John), 65% (Buck Island, St. Croix), 75% (Mennebeck, St. John), 95% (Newfound, St. John), and 62% (Tektite, St. John).
NOAA monitoring funds were received by the USVI Territorial Government in 2001 and University of Virgin Islands conducted the study.
The first year of this project supported six sites on St. Croix (six transects each) where coral, sea urchin (Diadema antillarum), and reef fish have been Monitoring in the monitored.

For the last three years USGS and NPS scientists have collaborated on long-term monitoring of coral reefs using a comprehensive protocol based on use of a digital video camera along randomly chosen transects (Miller and Rogers 2001, Rogers et al. in press).
This protocol is one of the most statistically rigorous methods to monitor coral reefs in the world.
A total of 79 randomly located transects at four sites (three in St. John and one at Buck Island, St. Croix) have been repeatedly sampled for two or more years.

At BINM, elkhorn coral (Acropora palmata) cover fell from 85% in 1976 to 5% in 1988 because of mortality from the combination of storms and disease (Rogers et al. 1982, Gladfelter 1991).

At Buck Island, Blackband Disease is seen on Diploria colonies but typically on fewer than 10 colonies a year (Zandy Hillis-Starr pers. comm).
A limited, recent assessment across the USVI found 3.4% (St. Thomas), 7.6% (St. John), and 2.0% (St. Croix) of coral colonies over 25 cm in diameter showing signs of disease (Nemeth et al. in press).

There is current evidence that elkhorn coral is recovering in the USVI.
Recruitment of elkhorn coral colonies may be increasing and biologists from NPS, USGS, and UVI are now monitoring and mapping this species at several USVI sites.
Plague Â­ In July 1997, conspicuous white
of Porites porites have died from an unknown disease (Rogers 1999, J. Miller pers. comm., B. Kojis pers. comm.) and some of these reefs have been dead for over 12 years (see Beets et al. 1986).
Porites porites is not known to be susceptible to either White-band or Blackband Disease.
Sea fan disease, caused by the fungus Aspergillis syndowii, occurs in sea fans on St. John reefs (G. Smith pers. comm.).
This pathogenic strain has been isolated from air samples taken during African dust events, suggesting a possible link between air quality and sea fan condition.

patches of necrotic tissue began to appear on scleractinian corals in several bays around St. John.
Tissue samples have confirmed that Plague is affecting these corals.
It has now been observed on 14 coral species.
The disease can progress up to 0.5 cm/day but does not always result in total colony mortality, however diseased portions never recover.
Monthly surveys on one St. John reef have documented new incidence of disease every month from 1997 to present (Miller et al. in press) making this the most destructive disease active on St. John.

Because conchs have patchy distributions and move among several habitats and over a gradient of depths, it is difficult to document and interpret changes in their abundance.
However, there is evidence of general declines in conch densities.

in the abundance of lobsters (Wolff 1998).
Wolff (1998) noted that lobster densities for 4 sites around St. John in 1996 averaged only 5/ha compared to 19.4/ha at 89 sites around the island in 1970.
Data suggest average size of lobsters declined within the park since 1970 (Olsen et al. 1975).

After depleting the larger species of groupers, fishers began targeting smaller aggregating species such as the red hind.
On St. Croix there is active targeting of the mutton snapper aggregations on the southwest side of the island.
Herbivorous species have increased in relative abundance in the catch while groupers and snappers have decreased.
Several studies document the failure of existing territorial regulations to protect reef fishes or reverse the declines in abundance of preferred species such as the large groupers and snappers (Beets 1996, Garrison et al. 1998, Wolff 1996, Beets and Rogers in press).
Lack of enforcement has no doubt played a role; in one study of traps set by fishers, over 50% had no functioning biodegradable panels to allow fish to escape if traps were lost (Garrison et al. 1998).
However, it is unlikely that even full compliance with existing regulations would be adequate to reverse the alarming trends.

Seagrass communities in three other bays have been monitored annually from 1997 to 2001.
In all these bays, seagrass have fluctuated but declined overall (L Muehlstein and NPS unpub. data).
Fish and Fisheries Â­ Reef fish
Up through the 1960s, groupers and snappers were abundant and dominated the landings in the USVI fishery.
Following the tourism boom and technological changes in the fishery (larger boats, engines, improved gear), fishers began to set more traps and to target species like groupers and snappers, especially their spawning aggregations.
By the 1970s, several spawning aggregations of Nassau grouper had been decimated and local abundance of this species crashed (Olsen and LaPlace 1978).
The Nassau grouper is still particularly scarce today (Wolff 1996, Garrison et al. 1998, USGS and NPS,
Â­ In general, increases in point and nonpoint source discharges are causing declines in the water quality in the USVI.
Wastewater disposal has been a chronic problem in the USVI.
There are eight sewage treatment facilities on St. Thomas, seven secondary plants, and an anaerobic pond at the airport.
The plants do not always attain secondary treatment discharge requirements (OAI 1999).
A new secondary treatment plant opened in 2000 serving the 2,000 residents of Cruz Bay and surrounding areas of St. John.
This secondary treatment replaced an overloaded facility that did not meet interim effluent limits and discharged into

assemblages have changed markedly in the USVI (Rogers and Beets 2001), but it is difficult to separate out the causal factors.
Over-fishing, deterioration of coral reefs, mangroves, and seagrass beds all have undoubtedly contributed to significant changes in reef fish assemblages.
However, many of the characteristics of the USVI fishery provide clear evidence of heavy fishing pressure.
unpaved roads are a major source of reef sediment
a salt pond.
The 50,000 residents of St. Croix are served by one primary wastewater treatment facility.
The sewage collection system consists of 87 miles of gravity and force mains, 3 major sewage lift stations, and 12 feeder pump stations.
Because of long detention time for flows arriving at the wastewater treatment plant, hydrogen sulfide is sometimes generated and deteriorates concrete sewer mains.
Sewer mains have frequently and repeatedly failed, requiring raw sewage bypass during repairs (OIA 1999).
Raw sewage bypasses have lasted close to a year.
Untreated rum-effluent from a St. Croix distillery is discharged on St Croix's south shore resulting in a 5-mile long benthic "dead zone" caused by the high toxin level, high Biological Oxygen Demand, and the high temperature of the effluent.
Each year the VI Government requests and has been granted an exemption from the U.S. Clean Water Act for this discharge.
Poor land management practices associated with accelerating development on St. John pose an increasing threat.
Over 80% of the island has slopes that exceed Figure 195.

(Anderson and MacDonald 1998).
Water quality data from 30 sites around St. John show that bays with developed watersheds have higher turbidity and light extinction coefficients, and lower light transmission than bays inside the park associated with undeveloped or less disturbed watersheds (USGS and NPS unpub. data).
Recent studies suggest that excess sedimentation can exacerbate the effects of natural bleaching events.
Nemeth and Nowlis (2001) found that bleaching of coral colonies during the peak of the 1998 bleaching event showed a strong positive relationship to sedimentation (r=0.92).
At reef sites exposed to sedimentation rates between 10 to 14 mg/cm2/d, 38% of the coral colonies examined exhibited pigment loss compared to 23% of the corals observed at sites exposed to sedimentation rates between 4 to 8 mg/cm2/d.
Coastal Populations and Reef Economics A total of 108.6 thousand residents inhabited the USVI in 2000, an increase of 6.7% from the 1990 census and 12.5% from 1980 (U.S. Bureau of Census 2002).
In 1999, total number of visitors to USVI was close to 2 million (560,000 air visitors and 1.4 million cruise passengers) and in 2000 arrivals increased to 2.5 million (VI

Average number of traps fished per full-time fishermen has increased from 4 in 1930, to 8 in 1967, to 
Maximum number of pots fished by a single fisherman in 1930 was 30 traps whereas in 1997 the maximum was 3000 traps (Fiedler and Jarvis 1932, Downs and Petterson 1997).

Socioeconomics Â­ Fishing is an important
recreational and commercial aspect of the economy of the USVI.
It is important to note that no fish are exported from the USVI; in fact, during peak demand fish are imported into the USVI (Downs and Petterson 1997).
USVI fisheries are small-scale, using several gear types to harvest over 180 species of reef fish (Caribbean Fisheries Management Council 1985, Beets 1997, Garrison et al. 1998).
The primary fishing gear in the USVI fishery (traps, followed by hook and line, and nets) has not changed greatly since the 1930s (Fiedler and Jarvis 1932), although the fishing effort has greatly increased and catch composition has changed (Appeldoorn et al. 1992, Beets 1997).
The level of fishing effort varies greatly, some fishers use little gear nearshore and others set long trap lines across the insular shelf (B. Smith unpub. rept., Garrison et al. 1998).
Reef fish harvesting equipment has become more sophisticated, allowing fishers to access more areas; set and retrieve more traps in a day; use longer lasting, less degradable traps; and subsequently severely impact many
Larger scale net fishing has been recently reported occurring in the reef areas adjacent to and east of Buck Island, St. Croix.
Large nylon fishing nets are set directly off the barrier reef in the evenings to catch species of fish during nocturnal migrations off the reef.
Subsequent to these reports, NPS has had confirmation that local fisherman have more fish than Figure 198.
This vessel was subsequently removed from the St. Croix reef it grounded on, but others still litter USVI harbor and reef areas (Photo: NOAA Photo Library).
they can sell in a day and would rather throw the fish out than sell the fish for a bargain price (J. Tutein, NPS Superintendent, pers. comm.).
Environmental Pressures on Coral Reefs A diverse array of stresses has caused degradation of USVI coral reefs, associated marine ecosystems, and the fishery resources dependent on them.
Some natural stresses such as hurricanes have had dramatic and acute effects, while
137 137
U.S. VIRGIN ISLANDS
generally cause changes that are difficult to quantify and track but are particularly damaging.
Moreover, stressors can act synergistically with natural disturbances to accelerate damage to reefs or slow their rate of recovery (Rogers and Beets 2001, Nemeth and Nowlis 2001).
Fishing Pressure Â­ Over-fishing throughout the USVI has had profound effects on the resources, including those within federally protected areas such as VINP and BINM.
Reports and observations from more than 20 years ago suggested that fishing was already changing the reef-associated fishes (J. Randall's field notes 1958-1961, Olsen and LaPlace 1978).
Fisheries are close to collapse, and even those ecosystems within the boundaries of "marine protected areas" are deteriorating (e.g., Beets 1996, Beets and Rogers in press).
Existing zoning, erosion control, and fishing regulations are not providing sufficient protection.
The present combination of natural and human stresses and the magnitude of their effects may be unprecedented.
Recreational Uses Â­ Destruction from

Prior to 1979, extensive thickets of elkhorn coral were dominant elements of USVI shallow-water reefs (Photo: Andy Bruckner).
other stresses are considered chronic conditions such as strong swells, sea temperature fluctuation, sedimentation, and pollution.
Human activities are superimposed on these natural stresses.
Anchoring and ship groundings on coral reefs and seagrass beds are examples of acute stresses with immediate, obvious, and sometimes longterm effects (Rogers and Garrison 2001).
Other acute human caused stresses affecting reefs, especially in St. Thomas and St. Croix, are dredging, sand extraction, groin construction, and sewage effluent (Goenaga and Boulon 1992).

boats running aground on reefs has been severe.
Large vessels (greater than 65 ft) run aground with surprising regularity on USVI reefs (more than twice a year) and vessels abandoned after recent hurricanes still litter several harbor and reef areas.
Small boats run aground on shallow reefs, destroying corals, particularly elkhorn coral.
For example, within VINP, an average of four boats per week ran aground on Windswept Reef (R. Boulon pers. comm).
After the installation of resource protection buoys in 1985, groundings to this reef have decreased to an average of one a year (NPS records).
Surveys off St. John make it clear that benthic resources have been damaged by anchoring (Link 1997).
A dramatic case of anchor damage involved the cruise ship "Windspirit" which destroyed a 283-m2
138 138
section of reef within VINP in 1988.
Ten years later, no significant recovery of coral had occurred (Rogers and Garrison 2001).
VINP has installed 211 moorings and over 111 resource protection buoys around St. John to help prevent anchor damage to benthic habitats and the entire southern section of VINP is a no-anchor zone.
NPS has been monitoring benthic recovery surrounding moorings in several bays for the last three years.
All three USVI islands have popular snorkel and dive sites experiencing heavy visitor use (
BINM remains the number one tourist destination for St. Croix.
Over 150 people per day visit the underwater interpretive snorkel trail and visits can peak over 200.
BINM has a mooring system at the underwater trail that limits boats and snorkelers, but intensive use has resulted in some coral damage (Z Hillis-Starr pers. comm).
Natural Stresses Hurricanes Â­ Since 1979, eight hurricanes

Authorities with jurisdiction over USVI waters and submerged lands with coral reefs.
In some shallow zones at BINM, A. palmata cover, already reduced from 85 to 5% by White-band Disease, fell to 0.8% after Hurricane Hugo (Gladfelter 1991).
Structural recovery from Hugo has been very slow due to several subsequent hurricanes in 1995, 1998, and most recently in late 1999.

have affected USVI reefs.
Damage varied with storm path, strength and velocity, wave height and direction, the dominant coral species, and reef depth (e.g., Rogers et al. 1997, Bythell et al. 2000).
Hurricanes David (1979) and Hugo (1989) were the most destructive and it appears that these acute incidents have pushed percent live coral cover to a relatively stable, albeit lower, equilibrium.
Bythell et al. (1993) recorded partial and total mortality of coral colonies of three common species at 15 BINM sites over a 26-month period (1989-1991) that included Hurricane Hugo.
The dominant species, M. annularis, suffered greater mortality from chronic factors such as predation and tissue necrosis than from the hurricane.
D. strigosa suffered more tissue loss from the storm than from chronic factors, while P. astreoides had substantial mortality from all factors.
Hurricane Hugo also caused a 40% decline in the living coral in transects surveyed on a reef in Lameshur Bay, St. John which has failed to show any significant recovery in terms of an increase in live coral cover (Rogers et al. 1997, NPS and USGS and NPS, unpub. data).
Macroscopic algae,
covering about 5% of the bottom before Hurricane Hugo, are now periodically very abundant and can reach averages of over 30%.
It appears that the level of herbivory by sea urchins and fishes has been too low to keep the macroalgae in check, and algae are inhibiting coral settlement and recruitment (Rogers et al. 1997).
Climate Change and Coral Bleaching Â­ Global warming is
thought to contribute to an increased frequency and strength of hurricanes in the Caribbean and coral bleaching is often associated with higher water temperatures.
The worst episode of coral bleaching to date occurred worldwide in 1998 (Pomerance 1999).
Extensive coral colony mortality was not associated with 1987, 1998, and 1990 USVI bleaching episodes.
At two St. John sites, bleaching of coral tissues was estimated in the fall of 1998 at 43% and 47% (Rogers and Miller 2001).
The 1998 bleaching episode coincided with the hottest seawater temperatures on record (four sites, NPS records).
At Caret Bay reef, St. Thomas, maximum bleaching recorded was 41% but most colonies had recovered within six months (Nemeth and Nowlis 2001).
Extensive bleaching (but not mortality) was observed at BINM in the fall of 1998 where an estimated 20% of D. strigosa at one site and 53% at a second site exhibited bleaching.
During the fall of 1999, when sea temperatures reached 28.8 C,

mild bleaching was observed on 16%, 26%, and 48% of the coral colonies greater than 25 cm in diameter on St. Thomas, St. John, and St. Croix, respectively (Nemeth et al. in press).

Assessments, Research, and Monitoring
Figure 203.
Little is known about the roles that deeper reef (A) and mangrove (B) habitats play in the life histories of shallow-water reef species, particularly those that have been overfished (Photo Matt Kendall).
Hydrolab (1977-1985) and 13 Aquarius (1987-1989) underwater habitat missions were conducted in St. Croix.
Much of the baseline information for the VINP comes from a series of reports produced by the Virgin Islands Resource Management Cooperative from 19831988.
Fairleigh Dickinson University's West Indies Laboratory, located on St. Croix, conducted nearly 20 years of ecological studies that established a baseline for BINM (Hubbard 1991, Bythell et al. 1992, Gladfelter 1992).
BINM and VINP have formal monitoring programs dating to the early 1980s focusing on coral reef condition, reef fish, sea turtle populations, and seagrass beds (only VINP).
USGS and NPS scientists have collaborated on long-term monitoring of coral reefs using a comprehensive protocol based on use of a digital video camera along randomly chosen transects (Miller and Rogers 2001, Rogers et al. in press).
Each year three coral reef sites (20 transects each) at VINP and two at BINM are monitored using this protocol.
For the past 14 years, reef fish in VINP have been monitored at between 4 and 16 reef sites (15-18 censuses are conducted at each site) and fish censuses were recently re-established at BINM (130 censuses).
Research and monitoring on

Several innovative marine research and monitoring projects have been conducted in the USVI.

Buck Island Reef National Monument Â­ The NPS manages the BINM, established on St. Croix, USVI in 1962 (Presidential Proclamation No. 3443) to protect one of the finest coral reef ecosystems in the Caribbean.
Additional marine portions were added in 1975 (Presidential Proclamation No 4346) and 2001 (Presidential Proclamation 7392).
Current size of BINM is 71 ha of land and 77.7 km2 of submerged lands.
Presidential Proclamation 7392 declared the entire Monument a no-fishing and noanchoring zone, ending 40 years of legal extractive use.
This monument is the first substantial "no-take area" established for the island of St Croix and will require consistent and enhanced law enforcement to protect the area and effect the recovery of St. Croix's depleted reef fisheries.
Up until 2001, only a small eastern section (49.7 ha) was designated a no-take zone, thus most of BINM was open to extractive uses including setting of fish traps, cast net, hook and line, and hand collection of conch and lobster.
NPS has had limited success in controlling illegal fishing due to a lack of law enforcement staff.
