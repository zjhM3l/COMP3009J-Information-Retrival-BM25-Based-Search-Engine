Executive Summary the autumn of 1997, a school I n encourages anonofymousMississippi hightedogram student member a crime prevention pr that reporting aler his adviser to the ing to campus armed student harmed, and a fact that an armed student was comintending to shoot someone.
The was apprehended, no one was potential tragedy was averted.
Middle school students in Iowa involved in a school-based crime prevention program decided to teach elementary school students crime prevention tips to make them safer.
In addition to helping their younger colleagues, the middle school students themselves became more involved in school activities and were better students.
Elementary school students trained as playground mediators in California have greatly reduced the amount of time that administrators and faculty spend on school disputes, as well as the number of fights between students.
Student-led crime prevention can help make schools and surrounding communities safer.
The concept, increasingly popular around the nation, is simple: young people given the opportunity to take the lead in making their schools safer will benefit both the school and themselves.
They also strengthen the social bonds that are essential to their healthy growth as members of the larger community.
This manual provides examples of student-led crime prevention, outlines its variations and describes key steps for bringing it to schools.
For the great majority of youths in the United States, school represents a safe time of the day.
"In 1998, students were about two times as likely to be victims of serious violent crime away from school as at school."1 It is a mistake to suggest that schools in America have been overrun by crime.
The strong commitment of administrators and educators continues to limit crime's encroachment on the task of education.

Of course, just because young people are less likely to be victimized by crime in school does not mean that schools are crime free.
Recent tragedies have raised awareness that no community can be complacent.
For years, we have known that America's youths are disproportionately both victims and offenders, and that this vulnerability extends inside the schoolhouse doors.
Â· According to recent studies, students are victims of over one million non-fatal violent crimes each year.
In 1993, 1995, 1997 and 1999, about 7 to 8 percent of students reported being threatened or injured with a weapon such as a gun, knife or club on school property in the prior 12 months.2 Â· Theft is the most common crime in schools, and students are generally more likely to be victims of theft at school than in the community.
In 1997, about one-third of all students in grades nine through 12 said that someone stole or deliberately damaged their property, such as their car, clothing or books, on school property during the prior 12 months.
This proportion was similar in 1993 and 1995.3 Â· In 1997, about 15 percent of all students in grades nine through 12 said that they had been in a physical fight on school property in the prior 12 months.
In that same year, 37 percent reported that they had been in a physical fight in any location (including on school property).4 Â· A quarter to a third of students report being offered drugs while at school.5 The challenges of dealing with crime and violence are not limited to middle and secondar y schools.
Though statistics are not readily available for elementary-age youths, we do know that certain behaviors (e.g., bullying, fighting, harassing, disrespecting property) as well as being victimized may predict future delinquent behavior.
Several studies, for example, suggest that bullying in early childhood may be an early sign for developing violent tendencies and criminality.6

The presence of crime in schools and the community plays a real and damaging role in the lives of many youths.
Nearly half of students change their daily routine because of the fear of violence at school or in the community.7 As many as four in 10 teenagers thought that at some point during their lifetimes someone would fire a gun at them.8 Crime, violence and drugs are consistently at the top of teen concerns in national polls.9 The good news is that in many communities, students have worked in leadership roles as well as in partnership with adults to reclaim schools, parks, playgrounds and streets.
Their energy, idealism, vitality and commitment have proved worthy antidotes to crime and its consequences.
Young people may represent one of our greatest resources in making schools safer, according to some studies, in which, for example: Â· Teenagers were more likely to volunteer than any other age group; more than one out of three teenagers and six out of 10 volunteers started volunteering by the age of 14; over half of teen volunteers got involved with volunteering through school or religious institutions;10 Â· Seven out of 10 young people saw themselves as capable of making positive changes in their communities; almost nine out of 10 young people could name specific steps that should be taken to reduce violence among their peers and in the community;11

Â· Nearly nine in 10 teens said they would volunteer for one or more kinds of activities that help prevent crime.12 Student-led crime prevention provides a vehicle to actively engage young people in the life of the school community, to ask for their help and guidance and to offer them the same.
It allows those close to the crime problem a means of action.
Asking students to become part of the solution is an important step toward safe and crime-free schools.
The most obvious benefit of doing so is that students provide an available resource in that work.
Less obvious, but no less important a benefit is that involving students builds partnership and teamwork skills, provides nontraditional roles for leadership, engages a wide range of students and enlists students in setting and sustaining positive behavioral norms.

What Is Student-led Crime Prevention? r vention in olves both educing opportuC rime pforeding to thevoccur andeadrention Coalition of nities crime to dressing causes crime.
Accor Crime Pr v of America, crime prevention is about adopting a pattern of attitudes and behaviors that reduce the threat of crime to individuals and communities and enhance their sense of safety and security.
Both actual crime rates and fear of crime must be addressed; criminologists have amply documented the independent influence of these factors.
Social ills such as poverty, racism, neighborhood disorganization and youth alienation are all part of the equation that yields crime-ridden and dangerous neighborhoods.
Because crime has many causes, the arena for meaningful preventative action is large.
Crime prevention initiatives can tackle issues as diverse as substance abuse, violence, vandalism, neighborhood environment, gang activity and the participation of citizens in neighborhood organizations.
Ultimately, crime prevention seeks to positively influence the quality of living and learning and helps to develop schools and communities in which crime will not flourish.
What does "student-led" add to this picture? Student-led crime prevention means that: Â· Students have real opportunities to develop, organize and execute crime prevention programs and projects.
Â· Students hold appropriate responsibility and accountability for activities, but school officials' responsibilities are acknowledged and respected.
Â· School officials, teachers and community members view students as collaborators and partners in school safety.
Â· Crime prevention and a student's role in it are viewed as an opportunity to create synergy with other strategies designed to ensure that schools are responsive to all children.

A number of independent evaluations of school-based prevention programs have shown them to have great promise.
Â· A curriculum-based crime prevention program involving secondary school student leadership was shown to increase students' sense of social responsibility as well as their crime prevention knowledge.1 Â· A study of peer mediation efforts in California showed that the implementation of these efforts reduced by one-third the amount of time that administrators spent helping to resolve student conflicts.2 Â· A study of a bullying prevention program for elementar y and junior high school children (in several countries including the United States) showed substantial reductions in the frequency with which students reported being bullied or bullying others.3 Â· Engaging students in structured problem solving of crime issues in their schools helped to reduce fighting among students, victimization of teachers and fear for personal safety, compared to a similar school where students were not so trained.4 Â· A conflict resolution program focusing on empowering students to take leadership roles in resolving conflicts demonstrated positive changes in classroom climate, moderate to significant decreases in physical violence in the classroom, and reduced name-calling and verbal insults.5 In short, evaluations confirm that the right prevention program implemented with fidelity and incorporated into a comprehensive prevention strategy can have a real and positive impact on the safety and efficacy of a school.6 At its core, student-led crime prevention is about youth-adult collaboration and trusting the capacities of young people to make a real difference in an area important to them--the safety and security of themselves, their friends, their school and their 6 SAFE AND DRUG-FREE SCHOOLS

community.
The actions may vary by age, by jurisdiction and by circumstance.
But the purposes are consistent: Â· To reduce or prevent crime; Â· To engage students as active leaders in the process; Â· To develop per vasive support in the school community for crime prevention; Â· To engage adults in partnership with youth; and Â· To enhance the sense of community in the school.
High school students might volunteer with prevention programs in collaboration with school security officers to patrol hallways; middle school stu-
dents might organize a forum to give students a chance to air concerns about safety; elementar y school students might develop a skit that teaches their peers the importance of avoiding strangers.
Student-led crime prevention cultivates a sense of shared mission between youths and adults, a sense that can be important for conducting other school activities.
According to the Hawkins and Weis social development model, meaningful participation in activities is one of the foundations upon which the elements of the social bond, i.e., attachment, commitment and belief, are generated, reinforced and maintained.7

Though student-led crime prevention encourages youths to collaborate with school administrators and other community leaders, adults retain the ultimate responsibility to both higher authorities and the public for the safety of the schools.
Why is a school-based program so impor tant? According to Professor Denise Gottfredson, a University of Maryland criminologist who is among the nation's leading researchers on school crime prevention: Schools have great potential as a locus for crime prevention.
They provide regular access to students throughout the developmental years, and perhaps the only consistent access to large numbers of the most crime-prone young children in the early school years; they are staffed with individuals paid to help youths develop as healthy, happy, productive citizens; and the community usually suppor ts schools' effor ts to socialize youth.
Many of the precursors of delinquent behavior are school-related and therefore likely to be amenable to change through school-based inter ventions.8 Preventing crime and promoting civil and lawabiding behavior have to be paramount goals of educators to ensure both an effective learning environment and the civic development of our youths, with which our schools are charged.

Why the Need for School-based Crime Prevention? Â· Schooling is a central experience in the lives of young people.
Â· A young person's interactions in school may significantly affect how he or she relates to peers, family members or future employees.
Â· Classroom disruptions, truancy, violence and vandalism can all compromise the efficacy of the education experience.
Â· School-related variables are among the strongest predictors of delinquent behavior in students.9 Â· School is one of the only formal institutions through which society can address a wide range of youths on youth-focused problems related to crime, including substance abuse, youth employment, peer and family relations, violent behavior and truancy.10
Organizational Frameworks School based, student-led crime prevention can take place in a curricular, cocurricular, or extra-curricular context.
Curriculum-based efforts may have their origins in virtually any discipline, ranging from health to economics, although they most often relate to civics, social studies, government or law-related education efforts in middle and high school environments.
Curricular student-led crime prevention programs often take place in the classroom where students are given the opportunity to present text material, to identify and recruit resource persons to share their expertise, and to lead classroom discussions.
Though some curricular programs emphasize instruction, others encourage students to plan their own crime prevention program or projects, usually drawn from subjects in the curriculum.
These crime prevention initiatives, carried out by students, meet SAFE AND DRUG-FREE SCHOOLS

the needs of school, neighborhood or community.
Middle school students may teach elementary school children tips on street safety.
High school students may educate their peers on preventing and reporting date rape and sexual assault.
Elementary school students may work with older residents on a neighborhood cleanup.
Community ser vice and ser vice-learning curricula also provide a venue for crime prevention efforts.
In some schools, for example, community ser vice credit is provided for such crime prevention activities as patrols or peer mediation centers.
Cocurricular and extracurricular programs, like curricular programs, are sanctioned and supported by a school.
They may or may not possess the instructional features associated with curricular models.
Cocurricular models take place during school hours but are not part of the official school curriculum.
Student patrols during school hours, a student
council-organized crime prevention assembly, or student development and administration of an anonymous crime reporting system are all examples of cocurricular activity.
Extracurricular models take place outside regular school hours.
Their focus can range widely.
Consider the following, for example: an after-school club may meet regularly and work to prevent drunk driving; students may organize and participate in a march against crime or attend a candlelight vigil; elementary school children may develop a bus safety program.

Various organizational settings may ser ve as the base for student-led crime prevention activities: Â· A group focusing on an issue, such as stopping drunk driving, helping peers in crisis, or stopping bullying; Â· A regularly scheduled activity such as crime prevention announcements over the public address system each morning; Â· Part of an initiative of a school organization that has another principal interest such as drama, public speaking, art or writing; Â· A leadership project such as a special committee of the student council; or Â· A project as part of a regularly scheduled class, e.g., health, social studies, business or English.
As with all school activities, it is important that crime prevention initiatives have home bases--that they be seen and valued as part of the school's core activity.
Having an established, recognized position provides a sense of identity and a structure for the development of leaders, materials and resources.
Finally, although these programs are connected to the school, their activities need not be limited to the school campus.
Students may extend their activities to work on problems shared by the school and the neighborhood or to address a communitywide problem of concern to students.
This extension may help students to recognize the links between the school and the community.

The Six Rs of Effective Youth Crime Prevention Programming r ap the benefits student-led In orvder toeffeectiveness.Theseofmay ebetostatedcrimethe pre ention, it is important to adher the principles that underlie as six Rs. Roles Students and adults should have clear and clearly understood roles.
They must understand how those roles support and enhance each other.
Roles for students must be substantive and should include key planning and leadership tasks.
A school administration's sanction and support are instrumental to the implementation of a successful crime prevention initiative.
Students, teachers, parents, law enforcement officials and the school administration all have roles to play in building and sustaining an effective student-led crime prevention effort.
Responsibilities The responsibilities of youths and adults must be well mapped out, and youths must perceive that they have meaningful levels of responsibility and authority (directly or implicitly).
Youths should be responsible for reflecting upon and constructively correcting their own efforts and the overall project or program.
Relationships Student-led crime prevention is most effective when it generates a positive web of relationships Â· between students, between adults, and between students and adults;
14

Page 22
Â· between people and institutions that can be strengthened (e.g., between students and police); and Â· between institutions that can be strengthened (e.g., between the school and the community's social service network).
Rewards Rewards do not have to be cash.
An appreciation party with pizza or cake, a certificate or some other sincere acknowledgment can suffice.
Whichever way it is done, youths and adults need recognition for their positive efforts.
Beyond the thanks to each participant, rewards can include the results themselves--less fear, safer schools, etc.
Respect Respect is a two-way street.
Youths must respect adults and adults must respect youths, including their ideas and their work.
Respecting students entails recognizing their differences, realizing that each child is unique and acknowledging each student's power to contribute.
British Prime Minister Tony Blair reminded us that "Everyone has talent, everyone has something to offer, and ... we owe it to every child to unleash their potential."
The great Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., once said, "Everyone can be great because everyone can serve."
Reaching Out Crime prevention activities can link people, places and institutions to the common goal of safer schools and communities.
They can help students connect with the neighborhood or larger community.
Collaborations with those at the local or even state and national levels can give students a broader context for their studies and lives.
Law enforcement officers can share their experience, business leaders can provide information and resources, national organizations can offer training and expertise, the prosecutor's office can provide training, community organizations can provide support for projects, restaurants can provide food for recognition events, and teachers and administrators can stay connected with students throughout these activities.
The list of potential collaborators is virtually endless.

Recruit Local Resources Student-led crime prevention activity can benefit from adult support, especially if that support can help students succeed.
Often overlooked but valuable local resources include, but are not limited to: Â· School security staff Â· School resource officers Â· School health staff Â· Parents Â· Local crime prevention officers Â· Guidance counselors Â· Probation officers Â· Students from other schools A major local resource, nationally generated, is the U.S. Department of Education's Office of Safe and Drug-Free Schools and the funds that it makes available to local schools.
Other locally accessible national resources include: Â· Web sites that are invaluable and getting better Â· Conferences, especially those that involve both youth and adults Â· National organizations that work with youths and/or focus on crime prevention Â· The organizations listed in the resource section of this document Permissions, Limitations and Liabilities It is necessary to review and secure permission or approval from school system personnel for student-led crime prevention activities.
Parental permission may be required either as a general policy or for specific (usually off-site) activities.

Limitations on the program may be needed or desired for one or more reasons: Â· Student safety: students should never be put into a position where they will have to confront or detain suspected criminals, whether those suspects are fellow students or strangers to the campus.
This must be left to trained adults, preferably to law enforcement officials.
Â· Lack of training: student projects or programs should not put young people in the position of providing ser vices that they are not qualified to offer.
Counseling of victims, mediation of disputes and counseling of peers are examples of work for which special training is needed.
Â· School policies: these may restrict when and where students may carry out projects in which students may take part, or what school resources may be used.
Â· Liability: liability issues have not been a problem in well-designed programs and projects where appropriate super vision is provided that is also consonant with student leadership.

Goals, Objectives and Evaluation Regardless of the project or program structure, both the school program and programs or projects designed by students should have a goal or goals.
Each goal should have clear, measurable objectives.
The objectives form a framework for a simple but useful evaluation of the activity.
Taking on these tasks offers an excellent opportunity for students to learn effective management techniques.
Training and Technical Assistance Crime prevention information and skills are vital to effective student-led efforts.
The local police department or sheriff 's office is the strongest partner in your community both for training and for referrals to other training resources.
However, it is important to tap into other resources such as victim service agencies, community mediation services, local prosecutors' offices, social services providers, school security staff and those who can teach public speaking and other skills.

Challenges to Implementing Student-led Crime Prevention Breaking the Ice
Ty ma
he first students to engage in crime prevention may need extra support for their efforts.
They have an idea for a prevention project but be reluctant to undertake it; they may have the desire to fix a problem, but lack the training, skills or resources to do so.
Here are a few strategies for helping to build a foundation for future leaders: Â· Provide youths crime prevention examples from elsewhere for inspiration.
Â· Send students and their adult advisers outside their usual environment for a planning retreat or a relevant conference, which can break the ice as well as build enthusiasm.
Â· Encourage students to select initial activities that are realistic and visible.
Â· Provide youths leadership training and/or crime prevention training.
Finding and Enlisting the Right Champion Fostering student-led crime prevention does not imply reduced adult commitment or energy for school safety.
Rather, it means more adult attention to working with youths and their issues.
Finding the right adult champion who understands the potential of the program and the commitment it requires can spell the difference between a successful and an unsuccessful program.
An adult champion must believe in the value of youths' contributions, must be able to share enough authority and decision-making power for youths to

exercise real influence, must have the character and communication skills to be a role model, and must be willing to take the time to make the extra effort needed to support the program, including acquiring crime prevention skills and resources if needed.
An adult sponsor may need release time from classroom responsibilities, opportunities to learn more about prevention, or less tangible forms of support such as continued encouragement and validation.
Sustaining the Prevention Effor t There is an ever-present need to sustain and advance the efforts driven by those who lead the prevention effort for a ver y limited time.
Here are a few suggestions to accomplish this.
Â· Consider continuing your crime prevention organization with an adult champion, someone who is recognized and valued by the administration and students alike and who has a proven record of success.
Â· Provide opportunities for ongoing peer recruitment and encourage continued promotion of activities.
Â· Ensure that incoming teachers and administrative staff know about the program's value.
Â· Nurture constant expectations (e.g., the tradition of student patrols, alcohol-free prom parties, crime prevention awareness weeks, etc.) but provide sufficient flexibility for students to direct the program.
Â· Continually and consistently educate all students about crime prevention so that the entire student body recognizes its value and values the students who lead it.
Not Enough Resources Student-led crime prevention initiatives cost surprisingly little.
Prevention is principally about

changing the way people think and act, such that activities are usually more human-resource driven than money driven.
Raising the resources to meet your program's needs requires creativity, persistence and a firm belief in the mission of the program as well as its potential to create real change.
Â· Involve students in the planning and development of your program.
Doing so will help to motivate them to raise whatever resources are necessary.
Â· Develop a clear and compelling vision that states why the project should be done.
Reaching Younger Students Do not overlook the potential for crime prevention initiatives by elementary school students.
They can do a lot.
Bus and hallway patrols can help maintain order.
Peer mediators can help settle disputes before they become fights.
Skits and roleplays can educate peers.
Involving elementar y school students requires careful planning and additional guidance.
Here are a few things to keep in mind: Â· Motivation in this age group is strong.
Often, they will have specific concerns for their safety as well as ideas about how to deal with those concerns.
Tap those resources.
Â· An adult-led, age-appropriate schoolwide prevention education program can be a good way to introduce the concepts and practices of prevention.
Â· Planning carefully what students can do and providing good guidance about school priorities and crime reporting will help younger children act within the limits of their capacities and power.

Model Approaches to Student-led Crime Prevention crime pre ention ograms var S tudent-led with comprvehensivprage of thethey a great deal respect to the students involved, the eness and approaches that they take.
It is important to recognize however that anyone or any group can work to address crime concerns in the school and community.
Key Club members might work to refine the disciplinary code; the community ser vice club may reach out to teach younger children about safety; a group of students may simply get together and work with the faculty to reduce school vandalism; an individual student may produce and distribute brochures linking students to valuable community resources.
Here are brief descriptions of school-based, student-led crime prevention programs from around the countr y. These programs share proven records of effectiveness, innovation and a commitment to the development of positive social skills.
Youth Crime Watch of America (YCWA) Youth Crime Watch of America (YCWA) has more than 1,200 school sites in 35 U.S. states, the District of Columbia, Guam and Brazil.
The program, active in primar y and secondary schools (ages five to 18), seeks to bring together youths of all backgrounds to identify and correct problems unique to their schools and communities.
The YCWA program aims to build positive values, good citizenship and self-esteem and empowers youths to take an active leadership role in addressing the problems around them.
YCWA assists students in developing youth-led programs through nine components: Crime Reporting; Youth Patrols; Drug, Violence, and Crime Prevention Education; Bus Safety; Mentoring; Conflict Resolution; Mediation; Peer and Cross-Age Teaching; and Action Projects.
These nine compo28 SAFE AND DRUG-FREE SCHOOLS

nents overlap, are linked and provide a framework for structuring a youth-led crime prevention initiative within a school or community in which the youths can take ownership of their own program.
A core group of students, usually five to 15 in number, direct the program with guidance from an adult advisor.
Many program sites have shown great success.
For example, crime dropped a reported 40.5 percent in Youth Crime Watch's first year at Braddock High School in Dade County, Florida (the largest school in Florida, with over 5,000 students).
Between 1994 and 1997 the number of incidents of disruptive behavior dropped by 38 percent, narcotics possession dropped 31 percent, and the number of fights declined by 39 percent.1 YCW also produces positive outcomes related to delinquency prevention, safer schools and healthy social development.
A third-party evaluation of Youth Crime Watch in 15 Florida middle and high schools in the spring of 2000 found that an overwhelming majority of the students surveyed felt that YCW was mostly or totally run by the students; well over half of the surveyed students reported an above average or extremely close relationship with other YCW members; 100 percent reported that they made new friends as a result of YCW; 92 percent reported that YCW members totally or mostly look out for one another ; and nine out of 10 felt that YCW helped improve student relationships with police officers.2 Students Against Violence Everywhere (S.A.V.E.)
In 1989 a high school student in North Carolina was shot and killed while breaking up a fight at a Friday night party.
His classmates responded by forming Students Against Violence Everywhere (S.A.V.E.).
Since then, S.A.V.E. has spread to locations across the United States and abroad.
As of 2000, there were 957 local S.A.V.E. chapters in 35 states and Canada, with more than 89,000 registered S.A.V.E. members.
S.A.V.E. is a club-based program in middle and high schools.
At the elementary school level, S.A.V.E. lessons are taught in the classroom.

Students who are responsible for the scope and focus of the program direct each school chapter.
While features vary from chapter to chapter, the key to the program is that it is student initiated and student run.
S.A.V. E. members work to stop violence before it starts through the promotion of non-violence in the school and community.
Chapter meetings revolve around educating students about violence, its causes and its consequences.
They learn about alternatives to violence and practice what they learn through school and community service projects.
As they participate in S.A.V.E. activities, students learn conflict management and mediation skills and the virtues of good citizenship, civility and nonviolence.
Teens, Crime, and the Community (TCC) TCC, a collaborative effort of the Office of Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention, the National Crime Prevention Council and Street Law, has grown since 1987 into a large-scale effort leveraging state and local partnerships toward making teens safer and giving them a positive stake in their communities.
As of 1999, half a million youths in more than 40 states have participated in TCC.
As of 1999, 73 percent of the TCC programs were in schools, 14 percent were in juvenile justice settings and the remaining 13 percent were in communitybased sites.
The TCC model combines education and action to reduce teen victimization and seeks to engage the strengths of young people, educating them and providing the opportunity for them to serve their communities.
One cornerstone of the TCC program is the TCC curriculum used in grades 6 through 12.
The TCC curriculum, which can be used independently or infused into such courses as law-related education, civics, social studies, health or contemporary issues, focuses on building understanding of crime, crime prevention, victimization, specific crime prevention strategies and juvenile justice issues.
In one of several independent evaluations, researchers compared TCC program students and control students in pre-post-test evaluations in 10 30 SAFE AND DRUG-FREE SCHOOLS

Iowa schools.
The evaluators concluded that TCC appeared to have an impact on students' belief in ethical rules, associations with delinquent peers, self-reported delinquency and altruism.
Results also indicated that students in the program group demonstrated an increased belief in the need for laws.
A 1997 study demonstrated that the increase in social responsibility of participating students was statistically significant in five of the seven categories, compared with a control group.3 SADD (Students Against Destructive Decisions/Students Against Driving Drunk) Students Against Destructive Decisions was founded as Students Against Driving Drunk in 1981 by students at Wayland High School, in Wayland, Mass., after two high school hockey players were killed in separate alcohol-related car crashes one week apart.
The core of SADD, then and now, is the Contract for Life in which students pledge to make responsible decisions and avoid the perils of drunk driving.
SADD is a chapter-based, youth-led prevention model with about 10,000 chapters in middle schools, high schools and colleges representing five million students in all 50 states.
SADD chapter members engage in school and community activities and campaigns responsive to the needs of their particular locations.
Projects may include peer-led classes and theme-focused forums, teen workshops, conferences, rallies, prevention education, leadership training or awareness-raising activities.
SADD reports that independent studies show that students in schools with an established SADD chapter are more aware and informed about the risks of underage drinking, other drug use and impaired driving than those in schools without SADD.
Students in schools with a SADD chapter are more likely to hold attitudes reflecting positive reasons not to use alcohol.
Originally, the mission of the SADD chapter was to help young people say no to drinking and driving.
In 1997, that mission expanded, with the acronym SADD now representing Students Against Destructive Decisions.
SADD continues to endorse a firm "no use" message about alcohol and other drugs, and its signature product, the Contract for Life, has expanded to include communication SAFE AND DRUG-FREE SCHOOLS
