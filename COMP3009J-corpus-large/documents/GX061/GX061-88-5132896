Seniors can now obtain more funds from a reverse mortgage, the origination fee has been limited, and more options are available to individual homeowners.
A reverse mortgage is a special kind of loan that allows senior homeowners (over age 62) to convert part of the equity in their home into tax-free income without having to sell the home, give up title, or take on a new monthly mortgage payment.
Borrowers can choose to receive these funds as a lump sum, monthly income (for up to life), line of credit, or as a combination of those options.
Larger Reverse Mortgages
Seniors can now obtain larger reverse mortgages this year because of higher loan limits.
The Federal National Mortgage Association, or Fannie Mae, the nation's leading buyer of existing mortgages, now has a national limit of $275,000 for single-family homes in its Home Keeper loans, up from $252,700 last year.
However, the limit is 50 percent higher for Alaska, Hawaii and the U. S. Virgin Islands.
The reverse mortgage plan insured by the Federal Housing Administration (FHA) also increased its limit, tying it to the Fannie Mae limit.
However, this plan's loan limit varies by geographic area.
The new loan limits will enable seniors to tap even more of the equity in their homes to enhance their retirement years.
Long-Term Care Insurance Plan
In another development, the upfront mortgage insurance premium charged by the FHA for a reverse mortgage can now be waived for seniors who wish to use the money received from the loan to purchase a qualified long-term care insurance plan.
Origination fee capped
The origination fee will be capped at the greater of $2,000 or 2 percent of the maximum loan amount.
The entire amount of the origination fee can now be paid out of loan proceeds, allowing the borrower to incur no out-of-pocket expense.
