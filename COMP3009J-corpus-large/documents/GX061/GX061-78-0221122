The American Muslim Political Coordination Council (AMPCC) designated September 11, 2002 as a National Day of Unity and Prayer to commemorate the first anniversary of the terrorist attacks on the United States.
A press release by AMPCC July 23 urged mosques, churches, synagogues, and other religious institutions to open their houses of worship on September 11, 2002, "for interfaith visits, prayers, congregational exchanges, and other activities intended to foster national unity and religious tolerance."
"It is imperative that all Americans come together on the first anniversary of the terrorist attacks to show that we are united as a nation and to reject efforts by any parties, whether overseas or within our borders, to divide the United States along religious or ethnic lines.
The Muslim community is part of this country, and we join our fellow citizens in mourning those who were killed or injured on that fateful day," said the AMPCC press release said.
AMPCC is made up of four prominent U.S.-based Muslim political advocacy groups -- the American Muslim Alliance (AMA), the American Muslim Council (AMC), the Council on American-Islamic Relations (CAIR), and Muslim Public Affairs Council (MPAC).

AMPCC American Muslim Political Coordination Council
FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
U.S. MUSLIMS CALL FOR 9/11/02 "DAY OF UNITY AND PRAYER" All faiths urged to open houses of worship for interfaith activities
(WASHINGTON, D.C., 7/23/02) -- A national American Muslim political council today announced a "National Day of Unity and Prayer" designed to coincide with the one-year anniversary of the terrorist attacks on the World Trade Center and the Pentagon.
The American Muslim Political Coordination Council (AMPCC), made up of the nation's four most prominent Muslim political advocacy groups, called on all faith communities to participate in the national observance by opening houses of worship on September 11, 2002, for interfaith visits, prayers, congregational exchanges, and other activities intended to foster national unity and religious tolerance.
A web site will be established to allow local mosques, churches, synagogues, and other religious institutions to register their participation in the national event.
A joint AMPCC statement read in part: "It is imperative that all Americans come together on the first anniversary of the terrorist attacks to show that we are united as a nation and to reject efforts by any parties, whether overseas or within our borders, to divide the United States along religious or ethnic lines.
The Muslim community is part of this country, and we join our fellow citizens in mourning those who were killed or injured on that fateful day."
AMPCC member groups will help coordinate the American Muslim community's participation in the National Day of Unity and Prayer.
As part of the AMPCC campaign, a step-by-step guide to holding local mosque open houses will be distributed to Islamic centers nationwide.
Other religious organizations, such as the National Council of Churches, are organizing similar observances.

American Muslim groups jointly and individually condemned the 9/11 attacks.
An AMPCC statement issued within hours of the incidents stated: "American Muslims utterly condemn what are apparently vicious and cowardly acts of terrorism against innocent civilians.
We join with all Americans in calling for the swift apprehension and punishment of the perpetrators.
No political cause could ever be assisted by such immoral acts."
