BLM Arizona Yuma Field Office
The Yuma Field Office encompasses 1.6 million acres of public land in Arizona and California.
Habitats vary from aquatic river, lake, and marsh environments to terrestrial uplands with broad sandy plains, rocky foothills, and desert mountains.
Vegetation ranges from wetland and riparian species such as cattail, willow, and cottonwood, to desert plants like creosotebush, palo verde, and saguaro cactus.
Bighorn sheep, kit fox, and many more species find food, cover, and room to roam on your public lands.
Among their many uses, these lands serve as habitat for a variety of fish and wildlife species.
This list of 63 mammals found within the boundary of Yuma Field Office has been prepared to help you better appreciate, and more fully experience, our desert wildlife.
Please be alert and sensitive to the disturbance your presence may cause some species.
Enjoy wildlife from a distance.
For information concerning State or Federal laws pertaining to wildlife, please contact your nearest representative of the Arizona Game and Fish Department or California Department of Fish and Game.
If you observe an animal that is not listed here, we would appreciate being informed.
