These rides are designed to teach the cadet about aviation and the basics of flight.
However, these rides are not considered flight training.
Flight Training
Civil Air Patrol cadets are eligible to receive flight training with Civil Air Patrol Aircraft at a reduced rate than would be found at other flight schools.
Cadets may receive flight training towards and including a Private Pilot Certificate in a Glider or a Powered Aircraft.
Flight scholarships are available to cadets to help offset the cost of the training.
Cadets age 14 and older may attend the NM Wing Glider Academy held every year in Hobbs, NM.
This academy is two weeks long and cadets are given flight training pursuant to solo in a glider.
Many cadets solo by the end of the academy.
A cadet may return to the academy as a staff member, aiding in the flight training of new cadets as well as receiving advanced flight training towards a Private Pilot Certificate - Glider rating.
Emergency Services
Eagle Composite Squadron cadets may participate in Civil Air Patrol Emergency Services including Search and Rescue and Disaster Missions.
Cadets may participate as communicators, ground search team members, flight line marshalers and mission staff assistants.
Cadet members who wish to continue as a cadet after the age 18 may participate as Aircrew.
Our squadron participates in missing aircraft searches, lost hunter/hiker searches, and disaster missions as they happen.
Special Activities
Cadets may attend state and national special activities.
These activities vary between one, two and three weeks and offer cadets an opportunity to learn and experience several subjects.
Here are just some of the activities cadets may attend.
Encampment - Held each year in NM and provides cadets an introduction to Civil Air Patrol and offers tours and guest speakers from the US Air Force, Department of Energy and others.
Attendance of an encampment is required to become a cadet officer and for some other special activities.
Cadet Officer School (COS) - Cadet Officer School is held annually at Maxwell AFB, Alabama next to CAP National Headquarters.
This activity teaches cadet officers advanced techniques of leadership, problem solving, public speaking and essay writing.
COS fills one of the requirements to become a Cadet Lt. Colonel.
