Title of Rule: Chapter 308-127 WAC, Timeshare, amending WAC 308-127-160 Fees.
Purpose: The department has reviewed the rule noted and recommends amending with new fee levels which will still allow for a sufficient level of revenue to defray the costs of administering the program.
Statutory Authority for Adoption: RCW 64.36.081 and 43.24.086.
Statute Being Implemented: RCW 64.36.081.
Summary: Amend WAC 308-127-160 for a reduction in licensing and renewal fees.
Reasons Supporting Proposal: Amending the rule with a fee decrease will still ensure that there is a sufficient level of revenue to defray program administration costs as required under RCW 43.24.086.

Agency Comments or Recommendations, if any, as to Statutory Language, Implementation, Enforcement, and Fiscal Matters: Fees to become effective on January 1, 2003.
Rule is not necessitated by federal law, federal or state court decision.
Explanation of Rule, its Purpose, and Anticipated Effects: Amends one rule reducing the initial and renewal fees for timeshare companies and timeshare salespersons.
New reduced fees will still allow the department sufficient revenue in order to maintain the costs associated with the administration of the program.
Proposal Changes the Following Existing Rules: Amended rule will allow for a reduction in revenue collection used to off set program administration fees required according to RCW 43.24.086.
No small business economic impact statement has been prepared under chapter 19.85 RCW. RCW 43.24.086 requires that regulatory program raise sufficient revenue to be self-supporting.
The current level of revenue collection warrants a reduction in fees and still maintains the level of revenue required administratively to operate the program.
RCW 34.05.328 does not apply to this rule adoption.
