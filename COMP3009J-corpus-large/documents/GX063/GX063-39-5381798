I want to express my appreciation to my colleague and to the government, to Iceland and its people for hosting these very important meetings.
We began a new era in NATO-Russia relations and it also gave me an opportunity to reinforce our bilateral relationship with Iceland.
It is a very strong relationship, it has existed for many, many years.
Iceland, a founding member of NATO, has been a contributing member of NATO for all these years.
We especially treasure the 50-year bilateral defense agreement that we have had with Iceland.
I reassured the Minister that we look forward to having this kind of relationship for many, many years in the future.
As we begin our discussions on the agreed minute and the transformation efforts that are taking place within the United States armed forces, I reassured the Minister and I reassure the people of Iceland that we value this relationship and we appreciate the hospitality of the people of Iceland have extended to us for these many years.
We understand the importance of our presence here as part of our mutual defense efforts and all of them will be taken into consideration as we start our negotiations on the agreed minute.
So, I'd like to thank Halldor for your hospitality this morning, and thank the people of Iceland for the hospitality they have extended to the men and women who have served here for so many years and who will be serving here for many years to come.
