Weekly Column -- March 21, 1997 Seniors Should Beware of Reverse Mortgage Scams I never cease to be amazed by the different ways unscrupulous people will try to make a buck, but the latest one pretty near takes the cake.
It seems that estate planning companies on the West Coast have started charging seniors a fee for information they can receive for free on reverse mortgages offered by the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development.
This is especially interesting to me because I sit on the subcommittee which oversees funding for the Housing Department.
In fact, the subcommittee discussed this issue with newly-installed Housing Secretary Andrew Cuomo when he testified March 19.
For older persons who want to unlock the accumulated cash value of their home without having to sell the home, a reverse mortgage could be the answer.
HUD's reverse mortgages enable homeowners 62 years old or older to supplement their retirement income by borrowing against the value of their homes.
Homeowners receive payments from lenders on a monthly basis, in a lump sum, or as a line of credit.
No repayments are required while a borrower lives in the home.
Lenders recover their loans plus interest from the sale of the home when the owners die or move out.
The FHA has insured about 20,000 reverse mortgages around the country since it began the program in 1989 and is working to increase the number in the next few years.
Many seniors went to these estate planning companies in order to receive help in securing a reverse mortgage, unaware that the firms charge a fee of six to 10 percent of the total amount borrowed.
This works out to be a fee of $3,000 to $5,000 on a $50,000 reverse mortgage--a fee for information that is easily available for free from HUD.
Though HUD has received a lot of criticism from many sources--myself included--for its history of mismanagement, I am pleased to say that the agency acted swiftly to put a stop to this process.
On March 17, HUD issued an order prohibiting the 8,000 lenders that issue mortgages insured by HUD from doing business with any company the charges these large fees for information about reverse mortgages.
HUD also provided the names of the so-called "information agencies" that have been scamming seniors.
Seniors should be very cautious about doing business with America's Trust and Patriot, Inc. of San Juan Capistrano, California; Paramount Trust and Financial Services of Oceanside, California; Senior Information Services of Dana Point, California; America's Financial of Las Vegas, Nevada; and Senior Financial Services of Issaquah, Washington.
No one needs these services to get a reverse mortgage.
Information on HUD-insured reverse mortgages is available free through a telephone information line: 1-888-466-3487.
At no charge, HUD gives people the name and phone number of a nearby HUD-approved non-profit housing counseling agency.
The counseling agency will give callers information about the reverse mortgage program and tell them how to contact at least three participating lenders.
By barring FHA lenders from dealing with the companies that charge huge fees to act as unneeded middle-men for HUD's reverse mortgage loans, we will make it impossible for these companies to continue taking advantage of older Americans.
I'm glad that HUD acted so quickly to stop these companies from preying on seniors.
This scam is a perfect example of how important it is for every consumer to exercise great caution when making large transactions such as mortgages.
You can never learn too much about such complex dealings, and I urge all consumers to take advantage of the information resources that exist at the local library and through government agencies.
The best way to keep from getting ripped off is to be an informed, careful consumer.
Please share your questions and comments with me.
