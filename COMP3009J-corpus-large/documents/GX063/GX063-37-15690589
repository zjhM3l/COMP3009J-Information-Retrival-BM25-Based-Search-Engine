Applying the principles described by Hagberg and Hagberg (1991) two duplication lines, DU1 and DU2, were produced by crossing suitable translocation lines (T-lines) involving the same two chromosomes each (Table 1).
Both pairs of parental T-lines, T5-7ab/T5-7aj and T5-7ac/T5-7ah, have interchanged chromosomes which are distinguishable from each other and the remaining chromosomes by their Giemsa N-banding patterns and/or arm ratios (Marthe and KÃ¼nzel 1994).
This allowed us to identify homozygous duplications by studying Giemsa N-banded mitotic metaphase chromosomes from F/2/ seedlings.
As compared to their parental T-lines, the plants of both the DU1 and DU2 line show somewhat reduced tillering capacity and have approximately 10% and 25% reduced kernel yields, respectively.
In principle, the translocation technique used allows precise predictions of the cytological size and location of duplicated segments if the breakpoint positions of the crossed T-lines are precisely known as in the case of T5-7ab.
However, in T5-7ac, T5-7ah, and T5-7aj the breakpoints could be assigned so far only to defined segments of different size (Table 1).
This is restricting the predictability of position and extension of the duplicated segments.
Thus, in DU1 resulting from the combined translocation chromosomes T57aj and T75ab, duplicated segments of uncertain size can be presumed to be located within the distal half of the short arm of chromosome 5 (5S) in addition to the proximal part of the Nucleolus Organizing Region (NOR) together with an adjacent segment of 7S.
Similarly, in DU2 derived from T57ac and T75ah, duplicated segments can be expected within the distal half of 5S and/or the middle region of 7L.
To confirm the involvement of 5S segments in duplications and to determine the genetic "make-up" of these segments, DNA markers localized in linkage group 5 of the German Igri/Franka RFLP map (Graner et al. 1994) were partly sequenced for constructing sequence-specific primers to be used in polymerase chain reactions (PCR).
Then, the DNA of each of the eight different translocation chromosomes of the four parental T-lines was used as a template for PCR as described by Sorokin et al. (1994).
The chromosome 5-specific RFLP loci were assigned to each of the two pairs of translocation chromosomes, T57aj/T75ab and T57ac/T75ah, constituting DU1 and DU2, respectively.
These studies revealed the locus MWG758 to be duplicated in DU1 and the loci MWG758 and MWG2056 to be duplicated in DU2 (Table 2).
Using additional RFLP probes and translocations involving chromosome 5, MWG758 and MWG2056 were physically assigned to neighbouring segments within the distal half of 5S at the positions 25-30 mGN and 30-46 mGN, respectively (KÃ¼nzel at al. 1995 and Sorokin unpublished).
Thus, as predicted, DU1 proved to contain a duplication spanning about 5 mGN at the position 25-30 mGN, and DU2 proved to contain a duplication spanning about 21 mGN at the position 25-46 mGN.

The programme for producing "directed" duplications of short arm segments of chromosome 5 via translocations was initiated to duplicate agronomically important loci such as Mla conferring powdery mildew resistance.
However, in the meantime it has been demonstrated that nearly all of the studied translocation breakpoints of chromosome 5 occur within regions of suppressed recombination while the overwhelming majority of the hitherto mapped RFLPs (and genes ?) belong to very distal chromosome segments expressing high recombination rates (Sorokin et al., this volume).
Therefore, translocation techniques, as used in this study, have to be considered less promising in duplicating genes positioned within chromosome regions of high recombination.
