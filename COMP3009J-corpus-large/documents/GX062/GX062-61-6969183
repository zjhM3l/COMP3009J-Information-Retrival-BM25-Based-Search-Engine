Introduction
For many centuries, dogs have been not only great pets for humans but also great friends, companions and protectors.
Dogs have helped provided assistance during wars as far back as the 1300's.
The have also helped the police in pursuit of drugs, bombs, or missing persons.
Yet they are also being trained for the very important purpose of helping people with a variety of medical and disabling conditions.
These amazingly intelligent and trainable animals are serving as eyes for the blind, ears for the deaf, as an alert system for impending seizures, additional strength and mobility for the physically unable, and comfort for the depressed and lonely.
Most but not all of these animal helpers are dogs, but monkeys and even miniature horses have been carefully selected and carefully trained by special trainers to assist a future human companion.
These special "assistance" animals play a major part and in some cases a life saving role in the everyday lives of many grateful people.
There are often many questions about the "rights" granted assistance animals in regard to where they can go, and what the responsibilities of businesses and other public places are as stated in the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) and other laws both Federal and State.
It was with these issues in mind that this resource was created.
Hopefully it will be a starting point in learning about the types of animals used, the sorts of conditions they assist with and some of the laws that affect them.
Guide Dogs
Most of us recognize a guide dog by a harness with a stiff, short, U-shaped handle that keeps the dog and the human companion in very close contact with each other.
Guide dogs help the blind/visually impaired to "see" in their everyday lives.
Guide dogs assist by stopping their human companion before crossing streets and making sure the streets are safe to cross, by avoiding obstacles such as signs, cars, and other people, and by helping their companion locate things.
Guide dogs were originally created to be guides for German soldiers that had lost their vision during WWI.
People that were blinded during the war took a strong interest in constructing a school dedicated to the training of dogs as guides.
The most common breeds used as guide dogs are German Shepherds, Labrador Retrievers, and Golden Retrievers.
Hearing Dogs
Hearing dogs provide the sense of sound to their hearing impaired companions.
These dogs can be trained to alert a person to a smoke alarm, door knock or bell, telephone, alarm clock, kitchen timer, baby cry, or the person=s own name.
A hearing dog is usually dressed with an orange collar and leash or a vest.
A variety of breeds are used a hearing dogs, since intelligence and trainability are more important than strength and size.
Service Dogs
Service dogs are trained to be the strength and movement for people with muscular dystrophy, multiple sclerosis, cerebral palsy, and congenital abnormalities.
A service dog can perform many tasks for their companions such as picking up dropped articles, pulling wheelchairs, assisting walkers, turning lights on and off, opening and closing doors, carrying school books, and pulling their companions out of bed.
Most service dogs are generally Labrador Retrievers and Golden Retrievers and can be identified by either a backpack or a harness.
Seizure Alert Dogs
There are two different types of seizure alert dogs.
1.
A dog that is capable of sensing a seizure before their companion even knows they're going to have one.
This dog alerts his companion by whining, licking the owner, getting the owner to lie down, and alerting others to their special companion's impending seizure.
This alerting behavior allows the owner to get to a safe place or in a safe position before the onset of the seizure.
2.
A dog that cannot sense the oncoming of a seizure but reacts while its occurring.
This dog can either get help or just be there for the victim.
Some dogs have the gift of sensing the seizures while others do not.
It is not a skill that can be trained.
Social/Therapy Dogs Social/Therapy dogs are trained for the main purpose of companionship.
There are also
visiting therapy dogs that help stimulate people in nursing homes or assisted living facilities to strengthen themselves physically by playing ball, brushing, petting, or going for a walk.
Any type of dog that is good natured can be used to provide these services.
