[smile.gif] Quick Tips to Score High with a Mystery Shopper A personal greeting, smile, and probing questions go a long way toward scoring high with both customers and the mystery shoppers who pose as them, according to Grace McGee, supervisor of the department's contract with a private-sector, mystery shopper firm.
"The greeting and smile help make the customer comfortable, while the probing questions really get to the meat of a customer interaction," McGee said.
"By asking questions, we get to the center of a customer's need and let him or her know that we care about helping."
During the April-June quarter, mystery shoppers gave 13 Employment Security and partner staff perfect 5.0 scores for their service.
Several of the mystery shopper comments on these high quality interactions can be viewed on InsideESD (the link will only work for users on the state backbone).
The Morning News will continue the short series on the mystery shopper results in Thursday's edition by providing examples taken from Mystery Shopper notes on less than perfect customer interactions.
No names are used in the interactions.
Under the contract with the private sector shopper firm, the department only receives the names of staff involved in instances involving a perfect 5.0 score.
