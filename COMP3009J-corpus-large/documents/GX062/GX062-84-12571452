Honorable Nick Smith, M.C., Michigan Testimony Before the Subcommittee on Social Security of the House Committee on Ways and Means Hearing on "The Future of Social Security for this Generation and the Next" Members of Congress and Business and Labor Groups July 10, 1997 Today, I will present my views on Social Security reform.
Social Security is in financial trouble.
Almost everyone agrees dramatic steps must be taken to clean up the way Social Security is financed.
Social Security surpluses of revenues over payments to beneficiaries are projected to end as early as 2005.
Social Security is not a good deal for anybody that has not retired.
For instance, men retiring in 1997 will receive about 1 percent rate of return on their and their employer's Social Security contributions.
This means that men and women retiring in the 21st century will receive thousands of dollars less than they might have received for investments in stocks, bonds, CDs, or mutual funds.
If a person's Social Security funds had been invested in the average stocks and bonds, over the last 40 years, the return would have averaged 9 percent.
We must reform Social Security -- making it a good deal for all Americans.
How soon should we deal with Social Security's impending bankruptcy? The sooner the better.
The longer we wait the more drastic the steps we will have to take.
The Social Security "fix" can only be accomplished in two ways:
* reduce benefits
* increase revenues
None of these are fun or exciting.
You have hard work ahead as you craft legislation to repair Social Security.
My Social Security Solvency Act uses a combination of many small changes to achieve fiscal solvency for Social Security over at least the next 75 years.
In fact my bill is the only legislation that has been introduced in the House that is certified by the Social Security Administration's actuaries as keeping Social Security solvent.
My Social Security Solvency Act allows each worker to establish a personal retirement security savings account (PRSA).
Workers would be able to save, in their personal account, 4 percent initially, rising to 10 percent, from their 12.4 percent FICA tax.
An additional 10 percent of gross wages could be added to their personal retirement savings account.
My testimony is drafted to answer the three questions posed by the subcommittee -
1.
To what degree is Social Security Reform necessary?
2.
Are the recommendations of the Advisory Council on Social Security and other reform proposals constructive? and
3.
Are there specific recommendations that Congress should consider as it moves forward?
Now let me answer the questions.
1.
To what degree is Social Security Reform necessary?
I believe that it is necessary to begin reforming Social Security this year.
First, we must demonstrate the retirement security alternatives.
My retirement security demonstration bill would allow for pilot testing of major proposals.
It is almost universally recognized that Social Security, with no changes, is headed
towards bankruptcy.
The only question is when will it happen? The obvious response is to make Social Security work better.
This means guaranteeing a fair return for workers as well as continuing equitable retiree benefits.
Most Americans who are retired depend on Social Security for a major part of their retirement income.
Today, fully 80 percent of Americans depend on Social Security for at least 50 percent of their retirement income.
Without Social Security reform, the financial future of America's seniors is in jeopardy.
In 1935, the Social Security Act was enacted to provide a government guarantee against poverty.
Although most people were unaware at the time, Social Security was designed as a pay-as-you-go system where current workers taxes go to pay current retirees' benefits.
Changing demographics, however, have threatened the solvency of the pay-as-you-go system.
In 1950, there were 17 workers paying taxes to support the system for each retiree.
Today there are only 3, and by 2029 there will only be 2.
This change was been caused by a combination of longer life spans and lower retirement ages.
In 1935 the retirement age for Social Security was 65 and life expectancy was 63.
Today, the early retirement age is 62 and life expectancy is 76.
To make up for this falling ratio of tax paying workers to retirees, Congress has continually raised taxes.
In 1950 only 3 percent of a worker's first $3,000 in earnings was taxed.
Today we tax 12.4 percent of a worker's first $62,700 in earnings.
Social Security taxes have been raised 37 times since 1970.
By 2010, members of the huge baby-boom generation will start to retire and draw benefits from the government's three biggest entitlement programs -- Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid.
In the 104th Congress, I introduced the Social Security Solvency Act (H.R. 3758) on July 9 in order to save and preserve Social Security.
In my proposal, we have ruled out tax increases, additional debt, and changes in benefits for essentially all current retirees or those over 57.
My proposal slows down the increase in benefits for higher income seniors and allows individual workers to invest some of their tax dollars in their own personal retirement savings accounts.
Private investment choices will be limited along the lines of restrictions for IRAs, but will be the property of workers.
If a worker earns an average return on his investments, he will get back more from Social Security under my legislation than under the existing program.
The worst myth about Social Security is that there exists a trust fund filled with the surpluses of years of Social Security tax payments.
In truth, the trust fund, like an empty vault, is filled with government IOUs.
My Social Security bill stops the federal government from future raids on surplus money coming into the trust fund.
When Congress reconvenes in January, I plan on reintroducing the legislation as the beginning of an effort to save Social Security -- make it solvent and ensure benefits for future retirees.
My proposal for Social Reform is -
The Social Security Solvency Act
* No Tax Increase
* No Transition Costs
* Private Investment Accounts using trust fund surplus
* Gradually reduces the increase in benefits for high income retirees
* Allows private investment account withdrawals at age 60
* Increases retirement age two additional years
* Assumes a 0.15 percent lower measured CPI growth
* Allows voluntary annual additional $2,000 PRSA contribution
* Balances the Social Security System for the next 75 years
* Retirees may choose payment options -- lump sum (up to 1/3 of discounted present value) with annuity or annuity only.
* After full payback plus interest, gradually reduces benefits for those making over $50,000
* COLA increase limited to dollar amount at 30th percentile for high income
* Newly hired State and local government employees join Social Security
* Couples receive a minimum of 133 percent of higher benefit
* Widows or widowers receive minimum 110% of married benefit payment
* Retirement age is ultimately indexed to life expectancy
Individual savings accounts (PRSA) will accumulate considerable sums resulting in higher retirement benefits.
The surpluses coming into the trust fund allow private investments (PRSAs) to start at 4 percent of payroll and increase to 10 percent of payroll in the year 2070.
My Social Security Solvency Act is the only House bill that has been "scored" by the Social Security Administration to keep Social Security solvent for at least the next 75 years.
2.
Are the recommendations of the Advisory Council on Social Security and other reform proposals constructive?
There are a lot of good ideas out there.
For instance, the Advisory Council has unanimously agreed that Social Security's financial problems are manageable and part of the solution is investing in the private sector.
These are compelling reasons to pilot tested private investment options.
We need to get going with retirement security demonstrations.
This will allow us to determine what -- works, is attractive to the customer, and can be administered easily and fairly.
Pilot testing of the reform proposals should start no later than October 1998 (Fiscal year 1999).
My draft bill (see attached) gives the Secretary of Treasury in consultation with the Social Security commissioner and congressional committees the authority to construct and implement retirement security demonstrations.
Reform proposals that need to be considered include:
* various IRA options proposed by members of Congress,
* options that would level the playing field for parents, especially women, saving for retirement,
* proposals that would improve pension portability,
* the Gramlich proposal,
* the Schieber-Weaver proposal,
* Senator Gregg's proposal,
* Senator Kerrey's proposal,
* My proposal,
* Representative Sanford's proposal,
* a back-loaded Individual Retirement Account,
* a union-sponsored savings plan, and
* other options to be developed by the Treasury Department, in consultation with the Ways and Means and Finance Committees, and private sector organizations.
Beyond these good ideas, there are retirement security alternatives that are actually working.
I asked the Congressional Research Service (CRS) to develop a comparison chart describing retirement security/Social Security options currently underway in various countries, states, and local governments.
(See Attached)
Australia, Chile, Columbia, Singapore, and United Kingdom have operating retirement security systems that merit review.
Also, various state and local systems offer ongoing demonstrations of what can work.
These systems often return much more than Social Security.
A study by economists at the Florida State University and Miami University found that the state and local government employee systems -- covering 1.9 million workers -- often pay retirement benefits of 2.5 to 7 times more than Social Security.
Time is important.
Workers should get the best deal possible.
Studies of Social Security/retirement security systems indicate that a much better deal can be had.
It is time to demonstrate retirement security options -- letting workers have greater control of their future.
3.
Are there specific recommendations that Congress should consider as it moves forward?
I propose two specific legislative recommendation for consideration by this Subcommittee as it moves forward:
*The Social Security Solvency Act of 1997 (Discussed above)
*Retirement Security Demonstration Act of 1997
Retirement Security Demonstration Act of 1997
Demonstrations, pilot tested under the Retirement Security Demonstration Act, will include options suggested by the three legs of the retirement security "stool" -
* private plans,
* workplace pensions, and
* Social Security.
The demonstrations will
* provide test marketing of the various options of funded retirement programs;
* confirm administrative feasibility of specific proposals;
* indicate the relative popularity of various proposals;
* establish costs of various proposals;
* provide benchmarks against which to measure savings patterns; and
* reduce accrued liabilities of the Social Security trust fund.
Significant issues under the demonstration program include
* A means of testing the feasibility and popularity of private savings proposals;
* No reduction in payroll tax receipts by Social Security Administration;
* No new compliance requirements for employers;
* The demonstration is based on equitable solutions to a growing problem; and
* The demonstration will likely prove to be extremely popular.
Conclusion
Thank you for your willingness to tackle Social Security reform.
You are to be complemented for taking on a most important issue facing America's future.
