[daiywash.gif] *EPF405 06/28/01 Text: UN General Assembly Adopts Declaration of Commitment to HIV/AIDS (Document calls AIDS a "global emergency," calls for action) (6760) The United Nations General Assembly Special Session on HIV/AIDS adopted a Declaration of Commitment June 27, calling the spread of the disease a "global emergency," demanding nations act promptly to respond to the crisis.
According to the best estimates from the Joint United Nations Program on HIV/AIDS (UNAIDS), 36 million people worldwide are living with HIV/AIDS.
The disease has killed almost 22 million people.
More than 13 million children have lost at least one parent to the disease.
The declaration -- "Global Crisis - Global Action" -- asserts the necessity for nations to exert leadership -- in the form of personal commitment and concrete action -- and to develop national strategies and financing plans for combating the disease.
The declaration adopted by the 189 members of the U.N. General Assembly also offers specific elements that national plans should include.
They should "address stigma, silence and denial; address gender and age-based dimensions of the epidemic; eliminate discrimination and marginalization."
The document also sets a deadline for these plans to be in place by 2003.
It sets other, long-range targets for countries to implement other components of an epidemic-fighting plan, such as programs to educate children and protect orphans, and to implement workplace programs.
The final days and weeks of the negotiations were marked by a controversy focused on how specifically the declaration should address the needs of groups that are at the highest risk for exposure to HIV/AIDS.
Earlier versions that mentioned commercial sex workers and men who have sex with men raised objections from a group of Islamic nations who argued that such mention gave some sanction to lifestyles considered unacceptable in many cultures.
Compromise language was finally adopted that calls for nations to "enact, strengthen or enforce" laws and polices to protect human rights, and eliminate all forms of discrimination against "people living with HIV/AIDS and members of vulnerable groups" without specifically naming those groups.
Further the declaration states that "the vulnerable must be given priority in the response."
Attorney John Sandage, a U.S. State Department adviser who participated in negotiations of the document, said, "It's a very strong declaration that we can be proud of."
He said that the United States "got everything it came here to get."
Jairo Pedreza, representing the non-governmental organization People Living with AIDS and a member of the official U.S. delegation, said the declaration is "a meaningful step forward, but I hope it is not the last."
Following is the text of the UNGA Declaration of Commitment: (begin text) 27 June 2001 DECLARATION OF COMMITMENT ON HIV/AIDS "Global Crisis - Global Action" 1.
We, Heads of State and Government and Representatives of States and Governments, assembled at the United Nations, from 25 to 27 June 2001, for the twenty-sixth special session of the General Assembly convened in accordance with resolution 55/13, as a matter of urgency, to review and address the problem of HIV/AIDS in all its aspects as well as to secure a global commitment to enhancing coordination and intensification of national, regional and international efforts to combat it in a comprehensive manner; 2.
Deeply concerned that the global HIV/AIDS epidemic, through its devastating scale and impact, constitutes a global emergency and one of the most formidable challenges to human life and dignity, as well as to the effective enjoyment of human rights, which undermines social and economic development throughout the world and affects all levels of society - national, community, family and individual; 3.
Noting with profound concern, that by the end of the year 2000, 36.1 million people worldwide were living with HIV/AIDS, 90 per cent in developing countries and 75 per cent in sub-Saharan Africa; 4.
Noting with grave concern that all people, rich and poor, without distinction of age, gender or race are affected by the HIV/AIDS epidemic, further noting that people in developing countries are the most affected and that women, young adults and children, in particular girls, are the most vulnerable; 5.
Concerned also that the continuing spread of HIV/AIDS will constitute a serious obstacle to the realization of the global development goals we adopted at the Millennium Summit; 6.
Recalling and reaffirming our previous commitments on HIV/AIDS made through: -- The United Nations Millennium Declaration of 8 September 2000; -- The Political Declaration and Further Actions and Initiatives to Implement the Commitments made at the World Summit for Social Development of 1 July 2000; -- The Political Declaration and Further Action and Initiatives to Implement the Beijing Declaration and Platform for Action of 10 June 2000; -- Key Actions for the Further Implementation of the Programme of Action of the International Conference on Population and Development of 2 July 1999; -- The regional call for action to fight HIV/AIDS in Asia and the Pacific of 25 April 2001; -- The Abuja Declaration and Framework for Action for the Fight Against HIV/ AIDS, Tuberculosis and other Related Infectious Diseases in Africa, 27 April 2001; -- The Declaration of the Ibero-America Summit of Heads of State of November 2000 in Panama; -- The Caribbean Partnership Against HIV/AIDS, 14 February, 2001; -- The European Union Programme for Action: Accelerated Action on HIV/ AIDS, Malaria and Tuberculosis in the Context of Poverty Reduction of 14 May 2001; -- The Baltic Sea Declaration on HIV/AIDS Prevention of 4 May 2000; -- The Central Asian Declaration on HIV/AIDS of 18 May 2001, 7.

Noting with grave concern that Africa, in particular sub-Saharan Africa, is currently the worst affected region where HIV/AIDS is considered as a state of emergency, which threatens development, social cohesion, political stability, food security and life expectancy and imposes a devastating economic burden and that the dramatic situation on the continent needs urgent and exceptional national, regional and international action; 9.
Welcoming the commitments of African Heads of State or Government, at the Abuja Special Summit in April 2001, particularly their pledge to set a target of allocating at least 15 per cent of their annual national budgets for the improvement of the health sector to help address the HIV/AIDS epidemic; and recognizing that action to reach this target, by those countries whose resources are limited, will need to be complemented by increased international assistance; 10.
Recognizing also that other regions are seriously affected and confront similar threats, particularly the Caribbean region, with the second highest rate of HIV infection after sub-Saharan Africa, the Asia-Pacific region where 7.5 million people are already living with HIV/AIDS, the Latin America region with 1.5 million people living with HIV/AIDS, and the Central and Eastern European region with very rapidly rising infection rates; and that the potential exists for a rapid escalation of the epidemic and its impact throughout the world if no specific measures are taken; 11.
Recognizing that poverty, underdevelopment and illiteracy are among the principal contributing factors to the spread of HIV/AIDS and noting with grave concern that HIV/AIDS is compounding poverty and is now reversing or impeding development in many countries and should therefore be addressed in an integrated manner; 12.
Noting that armed conflicts and natural disasters also exacerbate the spread of the epidemic; 13.
Noting further that stigma, silence, discrimination, and denial, as well as lack of confidentiality, undermine prevention, care and treatment efforts and increase the impact of the epidemic on individuals, families, communities and nations and must also be addressed; 14.
Stressing that gender equality and the empowerment of women are fundamental elements in the reduction of the vulnerability of women and girls to HIV/AIDS; 15.

Recognizing that the full realization of human rights and fundamental freedoms for all is an essential element in a global response to the HIV/AIDS pandemic, including in the areas of prevention, care, support and treatment, and that it reduces vulnerability to HIV/AIDS and prevents stigma and related discrimination against people living with or at risk of HIV/AIDS; 17.
Acknowledging that prevention of HIV infection must be the mainstay of the national, regional and international response to the epidemic; and that prevention, care, support and treatment for those infected and affected by HIV/AIDS are mutually reinforcing elements of an effective response and must be integrated in a comprehensive approach to combat the epidemic; 18.
Recognizing the need to achieve the prevention goals set out in this Declaration in order to stop the spread of the epidemic and acknowledging that all countries must continue to emphasize widespread and effective prevention, including awareness-raising campaigns through education, nutrition, information and health-care services; 19.
Recognizing that care, support and treatment can contribute to effective prevention through increased acceptance of voluntary and confidential counselling and testing, and by keeping people living with HIV/AIDS and vulnerable groups in close contact with health-care systems and facilitating their access to information, counselling and preventive supplies; 20.
Emphasizing the important role of cultural, family, ethical and religious factors in the prevention of the epidemic, and in treatment, care and support, taking into account the particularities of each country as well as the importance of respecting all human rights and fundamental freedoms; 21.
Noting with concern that some negative economic, social, cultural, political, financial and legal factors are hampering awareness, education, prevention, care, treatment and support efforts; 22.
Noting the importance of establishing and strengthening human resources and national health and social infrastructures as imperatives for the effective delivery of prevention, treatment, care and support services; 23.
Recognizing that effective prevention, care and treatment strategies will require behavioural changes and increased availability of and non-discriminatory access to, inter alia, vaccines, condoms, microbicides, lubricants, sterile injecting equipment, drugs including anti-retroviral therapy, diagnostics and related technologies as well as increased research and development; 24.
Recognizing also that the cost availability and affordability of drugs and related technology are significant factors to be reviewed and addressed in all aspects and that there is a need to reduce the cost of these drugs and technologies in close collaboration with the private sector and pharmaceutical companies; 25.
Acknowledging that the lack of affordable pharmaceuticals and of feasible supply structures and health systems continue to hinder an effective response to HIV/AIDS in many countries, especially for the poorest people and recalling efforts to make drugs available at low prices for those in need; 26.
Welcoming the efforts of countries to promote innovation and the development of domestic industries consistent with international law in order to increase access to medicines to protect the health of their populations; and noting that the impact of international trade agreements on access to or local manufacturing of, essential drugs and on the development of new drugs needs to be further evaluated; 27.
Welcoming the progress made in some countries to contain the epidemic, particularly through: strong political commitment and leadership at the highest levels, including community leadership; effective use of available resources and traditional medicines; successful prevention, care, support and treatment strategies; education and information initiatives; working in partnership with communities, civil society, people living with HIV/AIDS and vulnerable groups; and the active promotion and protection of human rights; and recognizing the importance of sharing and building on our collective and diverse experiences, through regional and international cooperation including North/South, South/South cooperation and triangular cooperation; 28.
Acknowledging that resources devoted to combating the epidemic both at the national and international levels are not commensurate with the magnitude of the problem; 29.
Recognizing the fundamental importance of strengthening national, regional and subregional capacities to address and effectively combat HIV/AIDS and that this will require increased and sustained human, financial and technical resources through strengthened national action and cooperation and increased regional, subregional and international cooperation; 30.
Recognizing that external debt and debt-servicing problems have substantially constrained the capacity of many developing countries, as well as countries with economies in transition, to finance the fight against HIV/AIDS; 31.
Affirming the key role played by the family in prevention, care, support and treatment of persons affected and infected by HIV/AIDS, bearing in mind that in different cultural, social and political systems various forms of the family exist; 32.
