Does Your Office have Telephone Customer Service in the Spotlight? Mystery shoppers felt the service was outstanding when staff looked up information or ensured the customer was very clear on where to find the information, according to the 3rd quarter Mystery Shopper report.
Top performers tended to ask more questions to better determine the customer's needs, offer additional service, show eagerness to help, provide personalized service, and confirm that the customer's needs were met.
Overall ratings for telephone shops dropped since last quarter (2.6 down from 2.9).
On lower rated calls, the staff sounded annoyed that they were being asked a question that did not pertain to their specific duties.
Mystery shoppers posing as business customers were referred to Labor and Industries, an 800 number, a website, or just transferred to someone else's voice mail with no explanation.
Staff are generally courteous and professional.
However, giving undivided attention and a smile over the telephone can go a long way to make our customer's experience a great one.
When customers require services over the telephone, things may get lost in the interaction, but one thing does not: A smile.
