25 Chapter 3 FITTING PUNISHMENTS TO CRIMES Introduction What are the sentences Americans would give to those convicted of violating the federal criminal code? Answering that question is the central concern of this chapter.
Of course, there is no single answer because there are many crimes defined in the federal statutes, varying in seriousness and in how those crimes affect the federal government, our major institutions, victims, and the general public.
Furthermore, each crime defined in the statutes is described in a general way whereas concrete criminal actions falling into any one general category are quite diverse.
For example, larceny is defined as the unrightful appropriation of property, but there are an almost infinite variety of properties and there are many ways of thieving.
It is clearly impossible to ask a sample of Americans to consider every possible act that is defined as a crime in the federal criminal code: The best we can do is to provide a relatively small number of examples, hopefully characteristic of some major federal crimes.
The Commission staff chose a limited number of general crimes, 20 Crime Types in all, using criteria that included frequency of appearance on federal court dockets and policy significance.
With advice from the Commission staff, descriptions were written of concrete actions believed to be clear examples of each of the types, 73 Crime Examples in all.
The central feature of each vignette was a description of a Crime Example of which a person was convicted, along with some features of the criminal act and some characteristics of the criminal.
As described in Chapter 2, most of the features of each crime and the characteristics of the criminal were randomly varied.
The 20 Crime Types and 73 Crime Examples are not representative samples of all federal crimes.
They were not chosen to mimic either the distribution of criminal cases in the federal courts or the distribution of felonies recognized in the federal criminal code.
For that reason the overall distribution of sentences given by the respondents is not of as much interest as the distribution of sentences given to specific Crime Types and Crime Examples.
Measuring how Americans wanted criminals punished was based on asking each respondent to "sentence" 42 vignettes, each describing a person convicted of one example of one of 20 Crime Types.
The Crime Types and Crime Examples are presented in Figure 3.1.

31 Overall Sentencing Patterns The sentencing task given to respondents assumes that issues of guilt or innocence have been previously resolved.
The vignettes each describe someone who has been convicted of an act or pattern of action that is deemed criminal behavior in the federal code.
The vignettes describe the crime in fairly specific behavioral terms without the general Crime Type involved being revealed.
In addition, for all crimes, the convicted person is described in terms of gender, family status, employment status and previous record.
An illustrative example of a vignette is shown in Figure 3.2.
Figure 3.2.
Illustrative Vignette Rating Task A man has been convicted of robbing a bank.
The robber pointed a handgun at a teller and demanded money.
The robber fired the gun at the ceiling, but no one was hurt.
$19,000 was taken.
The defendant is married and has a spouse and two children.
The defendant is currently unemployed and has served 2 previous sentences, each more than a year.
What sentence should be given in a case like this? CIRCLE EITHER 1, 2, 3 OR 4: 1 PROBATION No time in prison
2 PRISON Less than 1 year # Months ___
3 PRISON 1 Year or more # Years ____
4 DEATH Penalty
Note that respondents were asked to indicate which of several alternative sentences should be given to the convicted person.
The choices were as follows: Probation - no time in prison Prison term for less than a year and the number of months to be served Prison term for one or more years and the number of years to be served Death Penalty In addition to these choices, some respondents wrote in "life" as the number of years to be spent in prison and a few entered "deportation" as the sentence to be given in response to some of the immigration law violations.
Although interviewers were instructed to discourage such responses, some respondents seemingly had such strong preferences for "life" sentences that they could not be encouraged to convert those preferences into years of imprisonment.
It is also possible that interviewers failed to detect such responses when they were written in.
In any event, it appears likely that the proportion of "life" sentences
32 in this study is below what might have been obtained had we allowed for "life" sentences to be an acceptable alternative to specified years of imprisonment.
Table 3.1 presents the distribution of responses over the four choices as described above.
In a very small proportion of vignettes, less than one percent, no responses were made at all.
These non-responses most likely represent vignettes inadvertently skipped as indicated by their random distribution among Crime Types.1 Imprisonment for a term greater than a year was clearly the most popular sentence, being given as a response in more than 70 percent of the vignettes.
Probation and prison terms less than a year were given respectively to 14 percent and 12 percent of the vignettes.
The least popular were death sentences, given in only three percent of the vignettes.2

Includes life sentences written in by respondents.
Some vignettes were given prison sentences but the respondents did not indicate the prison term desired with the consequence that 801 vignettes could not be used when we consider the full distribution
In addition, there were 801 vignettes to which respondents indicated prison terms were to be given but the respondents neglected to write down the sentence lengths.
Obviously, these vignettes also cannot be used in any analyses.
Thus the overall valid response rate for vignettes was 98 percent: 71,470 usable vignettes out of a total of 72,594.
A small number, 24, of the vignettes were given the write-in sentences of "deportation".
We have chosen to treat these responses as equivalent to being placed on probation and hence as zero prison time.
When life sentence was written in as a response, it was given a special code.
There were 1,802 written in life sentences, covering 2.5 percent of all vignettes.

33 of the amounts of imprisonment, as shown in Table 3.2.
Probation was given to slightly more than 14 percent of the vignettes and in another 19 percent prison terms of less than one year were meted out leading to about one in three of the vignettes being given the "minimal" sentences of either probation or prisons terms less than a year.
Indeed, half of all the sentences were three years or less, as indicated by the median sentence of 3.0.
However, there were many longer sentences with 15 percent being over ten years, life, or death sentences.
Life sentences were written in as responses to 2.5 percent of the vignettes and death sentences to 2.7 percent.
In order to calculate the mean or median sentence given, it was necessary to translate probation, life, and death into numbers of years of imprisonment.
By definition, probation understandably represents zero years of imprisonment and was so coded.
The other two qualitative responses, life and death, required making somewhat arbitrary judgments.
Reasoning that the life expectancy at the time of conviction would rarely exceed 70 years, life sentences were coded as 70 years of imprisonment.
Death sentences presented a greater translation problem.
In a literal sense, a death sentence might mean a very short period of imprisonment until the sentence was carried out, but there is obviously no way a short sentence followed by release can be made equivalent to the same sentence followed by execution.
Using the reasoning that a death sentence was a more drastic punishment than life imprisonment and hence should be represented by a higher number, death penalties were coded as 100 years of imprisonment, an admittedly arbitrary translation.
Using those translations, the mean sentence doled out to the vignettes was 10.29 years.
The considerable difference between this number and the median, three years, reflects the heavy influence of extreme values in the calculation of the average of a highly skewed distribution.
These distributional properties of the sentences given presents problems in how to summarize properly the findings.
Ordinarily means are convenient summary measures but in this case the mean is far from the typical sentences given: more than 70 percent of the vignettes were given sentences that were smaller than the mean.
The mean sentence is highly affected by how life and death sentences are represented numerically.
The decisions made, discussed earlier, are admittedly arbitrary: other choices would also affect the means.
However, median sentences are unaffected by these decisions.3 For that reason, much of the analysis in this report uses medians as central tendency measures.
Suspecting that a few respondents with highly divergent sentencing patterns were playing an important role in producing the skewed distribution, that possibility was investigated, finding a number of respondents who were either considerably more punitive or considerably more lenient than typical for all others.
There were 34 respondents who gave out more than ten death sentences, a few giving as many as 30.
At the other extreme, 23 respondents gave out more than 20 probation sentences.
It is difficult to
Several alternative were tried: first, all life and death sentences were deleted resulting in a mean sentence of 6.2 years and a median of 3.0; and, second, we recoded all sentences above 39.2 years to that value, resulting in a mean of 7.2 years and a median of 3.0.
Clearly the mean is strongly affected by how life and death sentences are translated into sentence years, although the medians remain identical.
Note also that in either of these two alternative translation modes, means and medians are still very far apart.

percent of all respondents -- whose patterns of responses to vignettes can only be regarded as bizarre.
Removing these extreme cases from the data set noticeably lowered the resulting average to 9.11.
In subsequent calculations, the 101 outliers are removed from the analysis.
These explorations into the nature of the sentences given leads to the conclusion that no single measure can provide a full appreciation of sentencing behavior.
Accordingly, several measures will be used in describing how Americans would like to see convicted federal offenders punished.
As discussed in Chapter 2, the data are derived from an area probability household survey.
Although a properly carried out area probability sample provides unbiased population estimates, some portions of the American population are disproportionately represented in the resulting sample.
In particular, because we selected only one adult from each household, persons living in smaller households are over-represented compared to those living in larger households.
In addition some population segments are o ver-represented because persons in those segments were more likely to give interviews.
For these reasons it is necessary to weight the data to compensate for the patterns of representation in the sample.5 Most of the findings we present in this and subsequent chapters are weighted.
A graphical representation of the overall sentencing pattern is given in Figure 3.3 as a "box and whisker" graph.
The rectangular box spans the inter-quartile range, within which lies 50 percent of the sentences, in this case spanning from 0.83 to 10.0 years.
The two lines within the box represent respectively the locations of the mean and median.
The "whisker" extending from the top of the box marks the range over which sentences given are continuous and exceed the upper end of the inter-quartile range, and the bottom whisker does the same for sentences given that were below the bottom value of the inter-quartile range.
Sentences above and below the two whiskers are not plotted.6
The unweighted sample under-represents younger persons, males, minorities such as Hispanics and blacks, the less well educated and persons living in smaller places.
Typically, weighted data and unweighted data produce findings that are close in value: For example, the unweighted mean of sentences is 9.12, not very different from 9.16 resulting from weighted data.
See Chapter 2 for a fuller description of weights used.
These sentences, amounting to about six percent of all vignettes, are omitted in the interest of simplifying the graph.

Crime Types In Table 3.3, the sentences given to each of the general Crime Types are summarized, along with the sentences given to all crimes.
For each crime, six summary measures are shown: Median, mean, interquartile range,7 percent given probation, percent given life sentences and percent given death sentences.
The summary measures are given for all vignettes in the first row.
Subsequent rows are arranged in order of decreasing median sentences, with ties broken by the average sentences.
There are several outstanding features in the findings of Table 3.3: First, respondents clearly differentiated among Crime Types.
Kidnapping crimes receive the most severe punishments, with a median sentence of 25 years.
At the other extreme, the possession of a small amount of illegal drugs received the least punishment, with a median punishment of .5 years (six months).
All told, the 20 Crime Types account for about 21 percent of the variance in sentencing.8 Second, Crime Types that resulted in the actual or potential death of victims were most severely punished.
One of the kidnapping examples involved the death of the kidnaped person and one of the Food and Drug violations involved placing poison in over-the-counter drugs with a resulting death.
These two Crime Examples raise the means considerably for those Crime Types.
Third, the several summary measures of sentencing tend to be consistent.
Crimes with high proportions of death penalties tend also to have high percentages of life sentences and very low percentages of probation sentences.
Conversely, crimes likely to be given probation sentences are very unlikely to get long prison sentences.
Fourth, the average sentences are consistently higher than median sentences, by
The inter-quartile range is defined as the scores within which 50 percent of the observations fall.
The top of the range is the observation below which are 75 percent and the bottom is the point below which are 25 percent of the observations.

37 magnitudes varying from about 1.5 to 3 or 4, indicating that for every Crime Type, there are always some, although usually very few, who want to give long prison sentences.
Even for the drug possession Crime Type, there were a few who recommended the death sentence.9 Finally, the inter-quartile ranges (the boundaries within which the middle 50 percent of the sentences fall) for the Crime Types are quite large, indicating that there are many departures from either the median or the mean sentence.
In short, as far as generic Crime Types are concerned, there is no clear consensus on what the precise sentences given to convicted felons should be.

The distribution of sentences given to each Crime Type is displayed as a "box and whisker" graph, arrayed from left to right in order of decreasing sentencing severity.10 Kidnapping is at the one extreme and Drug Possession at the other.

It is especially noteworthy that Crime Types with high median punishments also tend to hav e lon g er bo x e s.
Holding Crime Constant Because each of the crime groups is made up of several examples and each vignette contains information in addition to the crime of conviction, clear consensus on the sentences to be given to crime groups is not to be expected.
All of the vignettes contained information on the previous record of offender and many contained information on the gravity of the offense.
For example, each of the fraud vignettes
The data used are purged of the 101 outliers discussed above and weighted to compensate for sampling disproportionalities.
In addition, it was necessary to code the top sentences as 40 years because the full scale of sentences would have produced graphs that were unreadable.
10
40 contained information on the amount of money obtained fraudulently.
These additional dimensions affected the sentence given to each vignette to some degree.
The impact of such information on sentencing will be analyzed in detail in Chapters 5 through 9.
We can anticipate those findings by indicating that the respondents did vary their sentencing behavior, as those descriptions varied.
Although 40 of the vignettes were constructed according to the procedure described in Chapter 2 in which the Crime Examples and other information were randomly assembled, there were two vignettes included in each booklet that did not vary from one vignette booklet to another.11 The two standard vignettes differ in the gravity of the offenses described.
One of the standard vignettes describes a person convicted of the possession of a small amount of marijuana "for personal use" and the other describes a bank robbery in which the offender threatens a teller with a handgun, and fires the gun with no resulting injury.
These standard vignettes provide an opportunity to examine the degree of consensus among respondents when confronted with identical crime descriptions.
The sentences given to the two standard vignettes are shown in Table 3.4, along with the sentences given to those vignettes when used as randomly assembled vignettes.
Contrasting the sentences given to the standard vignettes with the others of that Crime Type provides an appreciation of the amount of variation in sentencing behavior contributed by the descriptive dimensions added to each vignette.
Figure 3.5 also provides a graphic view of the differences between standard and randomly constructed vignettes.
As expected, there was more consensus concerning the two standard vignettes than concerning the randomly constructed counterparts.
Indeed, the standard marijuana possession vignette gets close to unanimity, with more than seven out of every ten vignettes receiving probation sentences.
In contrast, less than half of the random marijuana possession vignettes are given probation sentences.
Much the same can be said of the standard bank robbery vignettes.
In short, although the crime itself may dominate the process, sentencing is responsive to other information about the crime and the criminal when included in the vignette descriptions.
The two standard vignettes (reproduced in Appendix C) were given on a sheet separate from the booklet containing the randomly constructed vignettes in order to orient the respondent to the sentencing task and to provide the interviewer with an opportunity to explain the task, if the respondent appeared uncertain about how to proceed, as described in Chapter 2.
The standard vignettes were chosen to represent crimes differing widely in gravity in order to induce a common response set to the sentencing task.

42 Some Sentencing Variations by Criminal Characteristics Although most of the crime dimensions are specific to Crime Types, and will be discussed in later chapters, there are four which are included in all of the vignettes.
The four all are concerned with describing the offender: previous criminal record, gender, family status, and current employment.
Each vignette was assigned a description of the felon's previous criminal record, with the exception of those crimes for which a previous record was implausible, such as those describing police officers or public officials.12 Table 3.5 displays the distribution of sentences given to felons described as having no previous imprisonments, two previous imprisonments, and four previous imprisonments.
All the imprisonments were described as "at least one year," indicating that they were felony convictions.
Respondents clearly gave lighter sentences to those with no previous record: more than one in five (21%) were given probation (compared to less than eight percent probation given to those with previous records.)
The median and mean sentences, two and seven years respectively, were also lower; fewer were given life sentences or death sentences.
Respondents did not distinguish as sharply between those having had two and four previous imprisonments: median sentences (five years) were the same for both groups, although the average sentence for those with four imprisonments (12 years) was higher than for those with two (ten years.)
The percentages given life imprisonment and death sentences were also higher for those with four previous imprisonments compared with those with two previous imprisonments.
In short, felons with two or more punishments were given three to six additional years to their sentences and were more likely to face life sentences and death penalties.
Although the previous record of a felon clearly makes a difference in the sentences received, such information played only a minor overall role, accounting for less than two percent of the variation in sentencing.
In principle, federal and state criminal law treat men and women alike when convicted of felonies.
Some research has found that in practice women felons are often given more lenient sentences.13 How does the American public regard gender as a factor in deciding on a sentence for convicted felons? Table 3.6 examines whether men and women felons were treated any differently.
There were no gender differences in median sentences, and but slight differences on other measures.
On the average, male felons received about six months longer sentences, were slightly more likely to get probation, and were slightly more likely to receive either life imprisonment or the death penalty.
With the exception of slight differences in giving probation, respondents are clearly more lenient in sentencing women felons creating slight differences in treatment in their favor14 but it must be emphasized that these differences are very slight.
In addition to police officers and public officials, no previous record was assigned to large scale frauds committed by corporate officials, anti-trust crimes, crimes committed by gun dealers, bank officials and other high corporate officials.
These vignettes contained no information on previous record.
We have interpreted those vignettes as indicating the absence of a previous record.
To all other vignettes one of the following statements appeared: "..has never been imprisoned before."; "..has served two previous sentences, each more than a year.", and "...has served four prison terms, each more than a year."

Gender differences are significant, mainly because of the large N, but account for less than one percent of the variance .

Male was given as gender to 80 percent of the vignettes.
Although the federal guidelines state that the family and community statuses of felons should not ordinarily be taken into account in sentencing, the vignettes contained information about family status of the convicted felons.
This information was used in the vignettes because it was thought that the public might believe that persons who are embedded in their communities, as shown by being employed and sharing in the responsibility of raising a family, should be given less harsh sentences.
Perhaps the principle being followed is that those who are embedded in such relationships are less likely to commit additional crimes upon their release.
The findings show that respondents weakly subscribe to this principle in their sentencing practices, although family status counted more than employment.
There were no differences in sentencing when the convicted felon was described as employed, compared to being unemployed.
(The data on employment effects are not shown.)
The results were mixed when a convicted felon was described as "married and has a spouse and two children" when compared to being described as "unmarried."
Median sentences were
44 higher for married felons, four years versus three years, with a slightly higher chance of getting probation (14.3 percent vs 12.2 percent) but, according to all the other measures, offenders described as married were treated more leniently than when described as "not married," as shown in Table 3.7.
Mean sentences were higher for the not-married by about six months (9.3 versus 8.8 years) and the not-married were slightly more likely to receive life imprisonment and death sentences.
However, whichever part of the contradictory evidence one might choose to emphasize, family status is clearly not an important factor in sentencing.

The family status "not married" was given to 80 percent of the vignettes.
Joint Effects of Gender, Family Status and Previous Record Because the felon characteristics described earlier were randomly combined in forming vignettes, it is possible to look at their combined effects on sentencing.
It may well be the case that having a family counts more in the sentencing of women than men and that the effects of both are stronger for persons facing their first imprisonment.
Table 3.8 presents the mean15 sentences given to each of 12 combinations of gender, previous record and family status.
The effects of each of the characteristics hold consistently throughout the table: men received longer average sentences than women; felons with families received smaller average sentences than those who were not married; and, felons with previous records received longer average sentences than those facing their first imprisonment.
The effects also appear to be additive, with married women with no p revious record receiving the lowest average sentences and single men with four previous imprisonments receiving the highest.
Family status does not appear consistently to count more for women than for men and the effects of previous record are about the same for both genders.
Because crimes were assigned randomly to vignettes, any subgroup of the sample received equivalent samples of crimes making it possible to compare mean sentences calculated over all crimes.

Crime Examples We turn now to examine the sentences given to each of the 73 Crime Examples.
Each describes a specific example of one of the 20 Crime Types discussed above.
Thus, the Crime Type bank robbery is represented by six different Crime Examples each describing a bank robbery but varying in the robber's weapon use and threats made.
The sentences given to each Crime Example are shown in Table 3.9 arranged from top to bottom in order of decreasing median sentences, with ties broken by means.
The sentence severity ranking of each example is shown in the first column.
Heading the table are kidnappings in which the victims are killed, with a median sentence of 100 years, reflecting the fact that more than three out of five (62 percent) of the respondents wanted a death sentence for this crime.
Note that this kidnapping Crime Example received significantly greater punishment than the next in line.
The second ranked crime, poisoning over-the-counter drugs, receives
46 a median sentence of 15 years, many years less16 than kidnapping.
At the other extreme is the possession of "a small amount" of marijuana with a median sentence of zero years, reflecting that about three in five respondents gave probation as a sentence.
Some general tendencies appear in the array.
First, crimes involving the actual or potential death of victims or serious harm to victims tend to be at the top of the list, receiving harsher sentences.
Second, respondents apparently desire relatively harsh penalties for trafficking in illegal drugs, as shown by the four drug trafficking crimes being among the top ten crimes.
In contrast, possession of small amount of the same illegal drugs for personal consumption is clearly viewed as among the least serious crimes, all four drug possession crimes appearing among the bottom thirteen least serious crimes.
Third, for most Crime Types, the specific examples belonging to the crime groups do not cluster closely together.
For example, environmental crimes are distributed over a wide range, from rank 44 to 69; civil rights crimes ranks range from 41 to 71; and fraud crimes range from 8 to 72.
Respondents apparently weigh heavily the consequences of a crime in their sentencing.
Examples drawn from the same Crime Type that vary in their consequences for the safety of people are regarded more seriously.
Accordingly, the fraud crime involving selling defective helicopter parts to the government is among the most serious of all crimes (rank 8) whereas making a false mortgage application with the intention of paying back is among the least serious (rank 72).
Similarly, crimes that do not have specific victims or do not directly threaten the physical well-being of individuals are treated less harshly.
Because so many death sentences were given to kidnapping, arbitrarily given 100 years, this difference does not have any real meaning.

50 Summary The overall sentencing patterns of the respondents were described in this chapter.
Several important generalizations emerge, as follows.
Most respondents took the sentencing task quite seriously, making clear distinctions among Crime Types and Crime Examples in their sentencing of convicted criminals.
There is some evidence that a small minority were very severe in imposing punishments on each Crime Type and Crime Example, making most members of the sample seem relatively moderate in comparison.
Although only the most serious and the least serious crimes received anything close to the same sentence from all respondents, nevertheless there was some degree of convergence among respondents, an issue which we will return to time and time again in the remaining chapters of this report.
Respondents saw many distinctions among specific criminal behaviors that are formally grouped together.
Within Crime Types, specific Crime Examples often received widely different sentencing.
It appeared that respondents were more sensitive to the consequences of crimes for the physical safety of victims than they were to the economic losses suffered.
In short, any indication of violence to persons tended to be met with harsher sentences.
Although sample members treated first offenders more leniently than recidivists, the increases in sentences for the latter were not very steep.
Respondents were slightly more lenient in their sentencing of female as compared to male felons.
They were also slightly more lenient toward felons who were married and had dependents.
