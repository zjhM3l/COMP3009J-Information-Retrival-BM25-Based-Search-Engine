Damage to livestock forage, fences, or irrigation equipment on private lands.

(2) (a) Within a reasonable time, not to exceed 72 hours after receiving the request, the division shall investigate the situation.

(ii) The agreement must be made before a claim for damage is filed and the mitigation measures are taken.
