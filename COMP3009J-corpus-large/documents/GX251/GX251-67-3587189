BILL ANALYSIS CALIFORNIA STATE BOARD OF PHARMACY _____________________________________________________________________________________________ BILL NUMBER: AB 57 AUTHOR: BATES RECOMMENDED POSITION: NONE VERSION: AS AMENDED MARCH 10, 2003 SPONSOR: NONE SUBJECT: MDMA _____________________________________________________________________________________________ Existing Law: 1) Categorizes controlled substances into five schedules based on the risk of addiction and the existence of generally accepted medical use.
(H
This Bill: Categorizes MDMA (ecstasy) as a Schedule II controlled substance.
(H
Comment: 1) Author's Intent.
Existing federal law classifies MDMA as a Schedule I controlled substance.
However, state law does not classify MDMA as a controlled substance and law enforcement cannot charge MDMA violations under state law.
2) Classification of Controlled Substances.
Federal law spells out the criteria used to place substances in the appropriate schedule by the Attorney General of the United States.
Those criteria are excerpted below: a.
Its actual or relative potential for abuse.
b. Scientific evidence of its pharmacological effect, if known.
c.
The state of current scientific knowledge regarding the drug or other substance.
d. Its history and current pattern of abuse.
e.
The scope, duration, and significance of abuse.
f.
What, if any, risk there is to the public health.
g. Its psychic or physiological dependence liability.
h. Whether the substance is an immediate precursor of a substance already controlled under this subchapter.
Federal law provides added specific guidance on the placement of drugs into the five schedules, as follows: Schedule I.
Â· The drug or other substance has a high potential for abuse.
Â· The drug or other substance has no currently accepted medical use in treatment in the United States.
Â·
There is a lack of accepted safety for use of the drug or other substance under medical supervision.
Schedule II.
Â· The drug or other substance has a high potential for abuse.
Â· The drug or other substance has a currently accepted medical use in treatment in the United States or a currently accepted medical use with severe restrictions.
Â· Abuse of the drug or other substances may lead to severe psychological or physical dependence.
Schedule III.
Â· The drug or other substance has a potential for abuse less than the drugs or other substances in schedules I and II.
Â· The drug or other substance has a currently accepted medical use in treatment in the United States.
Â· Abuse of the drug or other substance may lead to moderate or low physical dependence or high psychological dependence.
Schedule IV.
Â· The drug or other substance has a low potential for abuse relative to the drugs or other substances in schedule III.
Â· The drug or other substance has a currently accepted medical use in treatment in the United States.
Â· Abuse of the drug or other substance may lead to limited physical dependence or psychological dependence relative to the drugs or other substances in schedule III.
J. Schedule V.
Â· The drug or other substance has a low potential for abuse relative to the drugs or other substances in schedule IV.
Â· The drug or other substance has a currently accepted medical use in treatment in the United States.
Â· Abuse of the drug or other substance may lead to limited physical dependence or psychological dependence relative to the drugs or other substances in schedule IV.
2) State Law.
California has its own controlled substance schedules which largely mirror the federal schedules.
However, states can and do sometimes place substances into higher schedules (e.g., move from Schedule III to Schedule II) independent of federal action.
It is unclear whether scheduling a drug at a lower schedule than specified in federal law is permissible.
The question has been referred to board counsel.
3) Medical Use.
This bill makes Ecstasy a Schedule II controlled substance.
One of the factors to be considered in determining whether a drug should be classified as Schedule II is whether the drug or substance has a currently accepted medical use in treatment in the United States.
Recently, the Federal Drug Administration (FDA) approved limited chemical trials of Ecstasy for the treatment of post-traumatic stress disorder.
4) MDMA.
According to the United States Department of Justice Drug Enforcement Agency, MDMA is a close structural analog of amphetamine and methamphetamine.
MDMA has both stimulant and hallucinogenic effects in humans.
In the 1970's, MDMA was documented to produce permanent damage to serotonin pathways in the brains of rats and monkeys.
Short-term, high-dose use of MDMA has produced incidences of
an amphetamine-like psychosis and, in some cases, severe hyperthermia which was unresponsive to medical intervention leading to death.
The subjective effects of MDMA in humans include a heightened sense of awareness as well as a feeling of increased empathy or emotional closeness to others.
The production of MDMA in clandestine laboratories; its increasing abuse among young people; and evidence of adverse health effects, including brain damage, to emergency scheduling of MDMA into C1 of the Controlled Substance Act in 1985.
MDMA is usually taken orally in doses ranging from 50 to 150 mg.
Doses of MDMA are often "piggy-backed" on each other in a series over just a few hours, leading to severe over-heating and cardiac emergencies which require medical intervention.
5) Analogs.
Existing law applies the same penalties to drugs that are unscheduled "analogs" of drugs listed in the controlled substances schedules (H
Ecstasy is unscheduled but has a chemical composition similar to methamphetamine, which is a Schedule II controlled substance.
California courts have held that Ecstasy is an "analog" of methamphetamine, and offenses involving Ecstasy may be prosecuted as if it were methamphetamine.
This bill would not affect the available penalties for the unlawful possession, possession for sale, and sale of Ecstasy.
The penalties would be the same as those currently being imposed under the "analog" statute.

ASSEMBLY BILL
No. 57
Introduced by Assembly Member Bates (Coauthors: Assembly Members Benoit, Daucher, Haynes, La Suer, Matthews, Maze, Mountjoy, Pacheco, Plescia, Runner, Vargas, and Wyland) (Coauthors: Senators Ashburn, Denham, Knight, and Morrow)
December 5, 2002
An act to amend Section 11055 of the Health and Safety Code, relating to controlled substances.
LEGISLATIVE COUNSEL'S DIGEST
AB 57, as amended, Bates.
Controlled substances: Ecstasy (MDMA; XTC).
Existing law classifies controlled substances into 5 schedules and places the greatest restrictions and penalties on the use of those substances placed in Schedule I, including prohibiting the prescribing of any Schedule I controlled substance and requiring the prescription for any Schedule II controlled substance to be prepared in triplicate, as specified.
The drug 3,4-Methylenedioxymethamphetamine, also known as MDMA, XTC, or Ecstasy, is a psychoactive drug possessing stimulant and hallucinogenic properties that is not classified within any of the schedules under the state controlled substances law, but is classified as a Schedule I drug under the federal controlled substances law.
This bill would classify the drug 3,4-Methylenedioxymethamphetamine within Schedule II of the state 98
AB 57
--2--
controlled substances law.
By expanding the scope of existing Schedule II crimes to also apply to this drug, this bill would impose a state-mandated local program upon local governments.
The California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the state.
Statutory provisions establish procedures for making that reimbursement.
This bill would provide that no reimbursement is required by this act for a specified reason.

entity engaged in the packaging, repackaging, labeling, relabeling, or distribution of dangerous drugs.
(B
Comment: 1) Author's Intent.
The author is attempting to address the linkage between drug manufacturer marketing activity and prescribing behavior.
The author cites both a Kaiser Family Foundation study that indicates 62% of doctors are accepting gifts from drug manufacturers and a study published in the Journal of the American Medical Association that found linkages between such marketing activity and prescriber behavior.
The bill adopts a sunshine approach to reducing the influence of drug marketing on prescribing behavior.
The bill is modeled on California's Political Reform Act that requires the reporting and publication of any gifts received by elected officials and other decision makers in state government.
The author's office expects that the public sharing of this information will reduce the number and value of gifts doctors accept from drug manufacturers.
The author notes that the Department of Health and Human Services, Office of the Inspector General is reviewing drug marketing practices in light of federal laws relating to kickbacks and is expected to issue an opinion in April.
That opinion may eliminate the need for this bill.
2) Reporting Requirement.
The bill requires the board make an annual report to the Legislature regarding the data submitted by drug manufacturers.
However, the legislation does not specify the content or purpose of such a report.
Publishing this gift information on a website and the publication of periodic analytic and statistical reports may be more effective in furthering the author's objective.
3) Trade Secret.
The bill prohibits the board from disclosing any information reported to the board that is designated as a "trade secret" by the manufacturer.
However, no definition of what constitutes a "trade secret" is provided.
Absent such a definition it is possible for manufacturers to designate all data reported as a "trade secret" and render any reporting requirement meaningless.
4) $25.
The bill specifies that gifts of less than $25 need not be reported to the board.
However, the bill makes no provision for increasing that dollar value over time (either by indexing the amount to the CPI or allowing the board to increase the amount by regulation).
Without a means to increase the dollar value of that exemption over time, the effect of inflation will be to require reporting of small gifts intended to be exempted by the bill.
5) Civil Penalty.
The bill specifies that a civil penalty of up to $10,000 per violation may be imposed.
A civil penalty requires engaging board counsel (the Attorney General's office) to seek such a penalty in court.
Providing the board with the ability to issue a similar penalty via citation and fine would be more efficient and significantly less costly to the board.
6) Definitions.
The definition of pharmaceutical manufacturer provided in the bill includes activities routinely performed by pharmacies and other board licensees, including wholesalers.
For example, pharmacies generally do not engage in the sort of marketing practices described in this bill, but would be subject to its provisions.
7) Devices.
The bill applies to marketing of dangerous drugs but not dangerous devices.
The rationale for this exclusion is unclear at this time.
8) Fees.
The bill would impose significant additional costs to the board but does not provide for the assessment of a fee to cover those expenses.
The bill requires pharmaceutical manufacturers to report but the board does not license manufacturers at this time.
The absence of such a license will complicate any effort to collect fees
from the manufacturers to support this program.
This program may be better located with the Food and Drug Branch of the Department of Health Services which does have regulatory authority over manufacturers.
9) Related Legislation.
Assemblyman Paul Koretz has introduced AB 1437 with similar provisions that assigns the responsibility for this new program to the Department of Health Services.

ASSEMBLY BILL
No. 1437
Introduced by Assembly Member Koretz
February 21, 2003
An act to add Article 6 (commencing with Section 110424.8) to Chapter 4 of Part 5 of Division 104 of the Health and Safety Code, and to add Section 14105.37 to the Welfare and Institutions Code, relating to drug marketing practices.
LEGISLATIVE COUNSEL'S DIGEST
AB 1437, as introduced, Koretz.
Drug marketing practices.
Existing law, the Sherman Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Law, contains various provisions regarding the packaging, labeling, and advertising of food, drugs, and cosmetics.
A violation of any of these provisions is punishable as a misdemeanor.
This bill would make it unlawful, under that law, for any person to engage in inappropriate marketing of any drug or device used in the treatment of life-threatening chronic conditions to physicians or other medical providers.
This bill would also require every pharmaceutical manufacturing company to disclose to the State Department of Health Services the value, nature, and purpose of any gift, fee, payment, subsidy, or other economic benefit provided in connection with certain drug marketing activities, with certain exceptions.
This bill would create a new crime, thereby imposing a state-mandated local program.
Existing law provides for the Medi-Cal program, administered by the State Department of Health Services, under which qualified low-income persons are provided with health care services, including 99
AB 1437
--2--
prescription benefits.
Under existing law, the department pays participating pharmacists a discounted price for drugs on a Medi-Cal list of contract drugs, and obtains best price rebates from drug manufacturers.
This bill would require the department, during each negotiation with a manufacturer regarding the purchase price of a drug or drugs used to treat a life-threatening condition, to require the manufacturer to disclose the aggregate marketing costs for the drug or drugs that are the subject to the negotiation.
The California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the state.
Statutory provisions establish procedures for making that reimbursement.
This bill would provide that no reimbursement is required by this act for a specified reason.

To make a number of technical changes to pharmacy law to reflect the recently expanded scope of practice provided to optometrists.
The changes would permit optometrists to order and receive drug samples, order and maintain drug stock (including controlled substances) in their offices and would eliminate a problem in current law that permits optometrists to prescribe controlled substances but does not allow patients to possess controlled substances prescribed by an optometrist.
2) Scope of Practice.
Therapeutically certified optometrists have the authority to prescribe both topical and oral medications for the treatment of certain types of eye disease and ocular injuries.
The drugs available to optometrists include controlled substances.

This Bill: Increases the penalty for unlicensed dispensing of dangerous drugs or dangerous devices to include the option of felony prosecution.
Comment: 1) Author's Intent.
According to the author, "Drug smugglers running black market pharmaceutical rings are taking advantage of recent immigrants looking to purchase the same medicines they used at home.
These medicines are smuggled into California and often fail to meet the Federal Drug Administration's (FDA) quality control standards.
They regularly lack warnings and proper dosage, and are frequently sold at exorbitant prices.
The deaths of two toddlers have been linked to black market medicine rings.
This bill will help rid the community of unlicensed doctors and pharmacists by increasing the penalty from a misdemeanor to an alternate felony/misdemeanor for the sale or distribution of illegal pharmaceutical medicines."
2) Wobbler.
This bill establishes a "wobbler" penalty for the unlicensed distribution of dangerous drugs or dangerous devices.
A wobbler gives prosecutors the option of charging the case as either a misdemeanor or a felony.
Wobblers are created to address crimes that have the potential to vary substantially in the severity of the offense
or to address individuals who are repeatedly prosecuted for the same offense.
This wobbler provision was included in the legislation that originally established this offense, but the penalty was reduced to a misdemeanor in the Senate Public Safety Committee.

Introduced by Assembly Member Maddox

An act to amend Sections 11352.1 and 101070 of the Health and Safety Code, relating to controlled substances.
LEGISLATIVE COUNSEL'S DIGEST
AB 261, as introduced, Maddox.
Controlled substances: dispensing or furnishing without a license.
(1) Existing law provides that any person who knowingly and unlawfully dispenses or furnishes a dangerous drug or dangerous device, or who knowingly owns, manages, or operates a business that dispenses or furnishes a dangerous drug or dangerous device, without a license to dispense or furnish these products, is guilty of a misdemeanor, punishable as specified.
This bill would instead make a violation of the above provision a misdemeanor or a felony.
By providing for the prosecution of the offense as a felony with its attendant prosecutorial costs, this bill would impose a state-mandated local program.
(2) Existing law authorizes a local health officer who determines that a person within his or her jurisdiction is unlawfully dispensing or furnishing specified drugs requiring a prescription, a dangerous drug or device, or a controlled drug, to take specified action, including the immediate closure of a business upon a reasonable suspicion that the business poses an immediate threat to the public health, welfare, or safety, as defined.
This bill would declare that nothing in that provision shall be construed to diminish the authority of local law enforcement to enforce 99

any criminal law relating to the unlawful dispensing or furnishing of controlled substances.
(3) The California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the state.

Section 11352.1 of the Health and Safety Code is amended to read: 11352.1.
(a) The Legislature hereby declares that the dispensing and furnishing of prescription drugs, controlled substances, and dangerous drugs or dangerous devices without a license poses a significant threat to the health, safety, and welfare of all persons residing in the state.
It is the intent of the Legislature in enacting this provision to enhance the penalties attached to this illicit and dangerous conduct.
(b) Notwithstanding Section 4321 of the Business and Professions Code, and in addition to any other penalties provided by law, any person who knowingly and unlawfully dispenses or furnishes a dangerous drug or dangerous device, or any material represented as, or presented in lieu of, any dangerous drug or dangerous device, as defined in Section 4022 of the Business and Professions Code, or who knowingly owns, manages, or operates a business that dispenses or furnishes a dangerous drug or dangerous device or any material represented as, or presented in lieu of, any dangerous drug or dangerous device, as defined in Section 4022 of the Business and Professions Code without a license to dispense or furnish these products, shall be guilty of a misdemeanor or a felony.

In recent years, the public has become increasingly exposed to a proliferation of persons who engage in these illegal or dangerous acts.
(2) The Legislature further finds and declares that extraordinary measures are needed to control this burgeoning problem.
Therefore, the occasional enlistment of local health officers in regulatory and enforcement functions normally reserved to the state is appropriate and necessary in order to protect the health, safety, and welfare of all persons of this state.
(3) Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing contained in this section shall be construed as limiting or supplanting the authority of the state agencies charged with the regulation of the practice of pharmacy.
(b) Whenever a local health officer determines that there exists in his or her jurisdiction any person who, without a license, is dispensing or furnishing drugs requiring a prescription pursuant to Section 111470, a controlled substance as defined in Section 4021 of the Business and Professions Code, or a dangerous drug or a dangerous device as defined in Section 4022 of the Business and Professions Code, the local health officer may take action against such that person.
This action shall include, but not be limited to: (1) Receiving and investigating complaints from the public, from other licensees or from health care facilities that a person is engaging in any or all of the activity set forth in this subdivision.

In issuing the order, the local health officer shall notify the person that the activity is illegal in the State of California.
In the event the local health officer determines that any or all of the items described in this subdivision must be confiscated, in addition to the cease and desist order, the local health officer shall enlist the aid of local law enforcement to execute confiscation of those items.
(3) Order the closure of the business, if any, operated, managed, or owned by the person after confirming that the person is engaging in any or all of the activity set forth in this subdivision, and determining whether the person has previously been convicted of engaging in that activity pursuant to Section 11352.1 or any other applicable provision of law.
If the public health officer has a reasonable suspicion that the operation of a business poses an immediate threat to public health, welfare, or safety, the business may be ordered closed immediately while the hearing described in subdivision (c) is pending.
Immediate danger to the public health, welfare, or safety includes, but is not limited to, evidence that the person is providing, selling, or distributing drugs that require a prescription, or dangerous drugs, devices, or controlled substances without a license.

Existing Law: 1) Requires pharmacists to provide oral consultation to each patient with a new prescription or when deemed necessary in the pharmacist's professional judgment.
(16CCR1707.2) 2) Requires pharmacists to inform the patient, either orally or in writing, of the harmful effects of a drug when those effects impairs the ability to drive a vehicle or when taken in conjunction with alcohol.
(B
This Bill: Requires pharmacists to provide a large-print informational insert for each prescription drug if the drug poses a substantial risk of harm if taken in combination with alcohol or other medications.
(B
Comment: 1) Author's Intent.
This bill is sponsored by the California Congress of Seniors and the California Senior Legislature.
The bill has been introduced to reduce adverse medication interactions by providing patients with more information about their medications.
The author notes that this problem is particularly significant in older populations who use more prescription drugs which increases the likelihood of interactions with other prescription drugs and over-the-counter drugs.
2) Drafting Concerns.
The bill requires pharmacists to provide printed material informing patients about interactions with alcohol or other drugs (both over-the-counter and prescription drugs).
Existing law (section 4074) requires pharmacists to inform patients (either verbally or in writing) of drug interactions with alcohol or that may impair the patient's ability to drive.
This requirement should be modified to eliminate a reference to interactions with alcohol since the new section requires providing the written material specifically for alcohol interactions.
Attached are proposed amendments that will address this duplication.

Prescription drug warnings.
Existing law, the Pharmacy Law, requires a pharmacist to inform a patient, orally or in writing, of certain information about the harmful effects of a prescription drug taken in combination with alcohol.
Existing law makes the violation of the Pharmacy Law a crime.
This bill would additionally require a pharmacist to include a large-print informational insert with each drug dispensed by prescription informing the patient when the drug poses a substantial risk of harm if taken in combination with alcohol or other medication.
Because a violation of this requirement would be punishable as a crime, the bill would impose a state-mandated local program.
The California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the state.
Statutory provisions establish procedures for making that reimbursement.

February 19, 2003
An act to add Section 490.7 to the Business and Professions Code, relating to the healing arts.
LEGISLATIVE COUNSEL'S DIGEST
AB 746, as introduced, Matthews.
Medical fraud: revocation of professional licenses.
Existing law establishes the State Department of Consumer Affairs, which is comprised of various boards, including, but not limited to, the Dental Board of California, the Medical Board of California, the State Board of Optometry, the California State Board of Pharmacy, and the Board of Psychology, among others, which each issue licenses.
Existing law authorizes a board to suspend or revoke a license if the licensee has been convicted of a crime that is substantially related to the qualifications, functions, or duties of the business or profession for which the license was issued.
Existing law provides for the Medi-Cal program, pursuant to which medical benefits are provided to public assistance recipients and certain other low-income persons.
Under existing law, the Director of Health Services is required to suspend the participation in the Medi-Cal program by a provider of services for conviction of any felony or any misdemeanor involving fraud, among other things.
This bill would require a board to revoke a license if the licensee has more than one conviction for any felony or misdemeanor involving fraud committed by the licensee in his or her capacity as a provider of services under the Medi-Cal program.

An act to amend Section 2836.1 of the Business and Professions Code, relating to nurse practitioners.
LEGISLATIVE COUNSEL'S DIGEST
AB 1196, as introduced, Montanez.
Nurse practitioners: prescriptions.
Existing law, the Nursing Practice Act, licenses and regulates nurse practitioners and authorizes a nurse practitioner to furnish drugs or devices that are classified as Schedule III to Schedule V controlled substances under the California Uniform Controlled Substance Act, subject to certain conditions.
Existing law makes a violation of the act a misdemeanor.
This bill would expand these provisions to include drugs or devices that are classified as Schedule II controlled substances under the California Uniform Controlled Substances Act.
The bill would establish additional requirements for a nurse practitioner who is authorized to furnish drugs or devices, including registering with the United States Drug Enforcement Administration.
The bill would require the Board of Registered Nursing to certify and issue a nurse practitioner a number that the nurse practitioner must document on all prescriptions he or she transmits.
By increasing the scope of the Nursing Practice Act, the violation of which is a misdemeanor, this bill creates a new crime.
The California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the state.

Comment: 1) Author's Intent.
The author is seeking to increase the availability of clean needles and syringes to reduce the transmission of blood-borne diseases such as hepatitis and HIV.
The bill accomplishes this by both removing the prescription requirement for needles and syringes and broadening the law permitting clean needle exchange programs operated by local governments.
2) Past Legislation.
Assembly Bill 136 (Chapter 762, Statutes of 1999) removed potential criminal prosecution for clean needle exchange programs operated by public entities or the agents of public entities.
Legislation in that same session that exempted needles distributed in a clean needle program operated by a public entity from the prescription requirement was rejected by the Governor.
3) Senate Bill 1785.
In 2002, Senator John Vasconcellos introduced Senate Bill 1785 which eliminated the prescription requirement for needles and syringes and instead required that they only be sold by a pharmacist.
The bill also limited the quantity sold to 30 needles per purchase.
That bill was supported by the board and vetoed by the Governor.
The veto message is provided below: To the Members of the California State Senate: I am returning Senate Bill 1785 without my signature.
SB 1785 would authorize pharmacists and physicians to furnish hypodermic needles or syringes for human use without a prescription.
In addition, persons who are 18 years of age or older would be able to possess up to 30 hypodermic needles or syringes.
I am committed to the underlying goal of the bill which is to reduce the transmission of HIV and hepatitis C among injection drug users, and I am proud of the progress we have made in combating these two diseases.
California spends $93.2 million on education and prevention programs and I have added millions of dollars in the Office of AIDS for behavioral and early intervention, programs for high-risk youth, communities of color and HIV prevention evaluation.
I have strongly supported our new HIV reporting system which will reveal trends in HIV transmission and assist in targeting HIV education, prevention and care efforts.
I have
signed legislation that already makes hypodermic needles and syringes available from authorized, legally sanctioned syringe exchange programs located throughout California.
In Spring 2000, the Department of Health Services appointed the Hepatitis C Working Group, comprised of key stakeholders from the public and private sectors.
The Working Group developed the first-ever hepatitis C strategic plan for California.
In August 2000, I signed SB 1256 (Polanco) which allocated $1.5 million for hepatitis C outreach and education.
I worked hard with the author of the legislation I signed in 1999 to bring law enforcement and health officials together on a bill that would decriminalize supervised needle exchange programs.
This bill undermines the key elements that won my support for that legislation: * It eliminates the requirement for a one-for-one exchange of syringes, which is the standard of practice in authorized needle exchange programs.
* By eliminating the one-on-one exchange, this bill eliminates the ability to focus aggressive intervention efforts toward getting drug addicts into treatment.
* It eliminates the requirement that needle exchange programs be conducted with local government approval, ongoing oversight and as the result of a declared health emergency.
Additionally, this bill could potentially increase the amount of contaminated needles and syringes in parks, beaches and other public areas.
This would place the non-injection drug using population at greater risk for HIV, hepatitis C, and other blood-borne diseases.
While I appreciate the author's hard work and dedication to this issue, I cannot sign this measure.
The board supported SB 1785.
4) Related Legislation.
Senate Bill 774 (Vasconcellos) has been introduced in this session that is substantially the same as Senate Bill 1785 referenced above.

AIDS: clean needle and syringe exchange program.
Existing law authorizes pharmacists and physicians to furnish hypodermic needles and syringes without a prescription or permit for human use in the administration of insulin or adrenaline if certain conditions are met.
Existing law prohibits any public entity, and its agents or employees, from being subject to criminal prosecution for distribution of hypodermic needles or syringes to participants in clean needle and syringe exchange projects authorized by the public entity pursuant to a declaration of a local emergency due to the existence of a critical local public health crisis.
This bill would authorize cities, counties, or cities and counties to develop clean needle and syringe exchange projects that contain prescribed components, and would authorize pharmacists, physicians, and certain persons authorized under those projects to furnish hypodermic needles and syringes without a prescription or permit.
This bill would require that a participating county, city, or city and county assess the project using certain criteria, and submit a progress report that takes into consideration data from the assessment to the 99

The Legislature finds and declares all of the following: (a) The rapidly spreading acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS) epidemic, and the more recent spread of blood-borne hepatitis, pose an unprecedented public health crisis in California, and threaten, in one way or another, the life and health of every Californian.
(b) Injection drug users are the second largest group at risk of becoming infected with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and developing AIDS, and they are the primary source of heterosexual, female, and perinatal transmission in California, the United States, and Europe.
(c) According to the Office of AIDS, injection drug use has emerged as one of the most prevalent risk factors for new AIDS cases in California.
(d) Studies indicate that the lack of sterile needles available on the streets, and the existence of laws restricting needle availability promote needle sharing, and consequently the spread of HIV among injection drug users.
The sharing of contaminated needles is the primary means of HIV transmission within the injection drug user population.
(e) Most injection drug users use a variety of drugs, mainly heroin, cocaine, and amphetamines.
Because amphetamine- and cocaine-injecting drug users inject more frequently than heroin users, their risk for HIV infection is higher.

CLEAN NEEDLE AND SYRINGE E PROGRAM XCHANGE
121345.
(a) The Legislature finds and declares that scientific data from needle exchange programs in the United States and in Europe have shown that the exchange of used hypodermic needles and syringes for clean hypodermic needles and syringes does not increase drug use in the population, can serve as an important bridge to treatment and recovery from drug abuse, and can curtail the spread of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection among the intravenous drug user population.
(b) In order to attempt to reduce the spread of HIV infection and blood-borne hepatitis among the intravenous drug user population within California, the Legislature hereby authorizes a clean needle and syringe exchange program pursuant to this chapter in any city and county, county, or city upon the action of a county board of supervisors and the local health officer or health commission of that county, or upon the action of the city council, the mayor, and the local health officer of a city with a health department, or upon the action of the city council and the mayor of a city without a health department.

BILL ANALYSIS
CALIFORNIA STATE BOARD OF PHARMACY VERSION: AS INTRODUCED SPONSOR: CPHA
BILL NUMBER: AB 1460 AUTHOR: NATION RECOMMENDED POSITION: SUPPORT SUBJECT: LABORATORY DIRECTORS
Existing Law: 1) Permits a physician or a person licensed as a clinical laboratory director to act as a clinical laboratory director.
(B
(B
This Bill: Permits a pharmacist to become a laboratory director based on his/her pharmacist license.
(B
Comment: 1) Author's Intent.
The bill was introduced to permit pharmacists to perform waived tests in a pharmacy without an outside laboratory director.
The sponsor indicates that amendments are forthcoming that reflect this intent.
The sponsor further indicates, that by permitting pharmacists to perform waived tests in a pharmacy, patients will have better access to tests required to appropriately manage their drug therapy.
2) CLIA?.
Prior to 1988, less that 10% of all clinical laboratories were required to meet quality standards.
Approximately 12,000 hospitals and independent laboratories were regulated under the Clinical Laboratory Improvement Act of 1967 (CLIA '67) and the Medicare and Medicaid programs.
Congressional hearings revealed serious deficiencies in quality in physician office laboratories and in Pap smear testing.
Studies have demonstrated that laboratories meeting minimum personnel and quality requirements perform better than those that do not.
CLIA '88 was passed to provide assurance to the public that access to safe, accurate laboratory testing is available.
Currently, under the Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments of 1988 (CLIA '88), all 150,000 clinical laboratories, including physician office laboratories, are regulated to ensure the quality of test results.
The CLIA '88 regulation unified and replaced past standards with the single set of requirements that apply to laboratory testing of human specimens.
Standards for laboratory personnel, quality control and quality assurance are based on test complexity and potential harm to the patient.
3) Complexity.
Determining which CLIA '88 standards apply to a test depends upon the level of complexity of that test.
Three categories of testing complexity have been defined under CLIA '88.
They are waived, moderate and high.
One reason the tests are placed into categories is to reduce the burden of regulation for those laboratories performing tests for which a low probability of an erroneous result exists.
For example, there are no personnel or inspection requirement for the waived category of testing.
In addition, 75% of all tests falls within the moderate complexity category which permits an individual with only a high school degree and appropriate training to perform these tests.
4) California CLIA.
CLIA permits a state with stricter clinical laboratory standards to obtain an exemption from federal regulation (and fees) if the lab tests and personnel that would be subject to CLIA are regulated by that state's clinical lab law.
Prior to the enactment of the CLIA, California already had an extensive administrative scheme for regulating clinical labs and lab personnel.
However, that state law was not, in all respects, equal to or greater in regulatory oversight coverage to CLIA.
Consequently, in 1995 the Legislature enacted SB 113 to bring California's clinical lab law into compliance with all of CLIA's requirements so that California could obtain a waiver from CLIA and continue to regulate its clinical labs at the state level.
One of the key components of CLIA and state clinical lab law was the requirement that clinical labs be overseen by a lab director who would be responsible for the quality control of the testing and the competency and training of the personnel who were conducting the tests.
Besides a licensed physician, California law permits other persons, a licensed bioanalyst or a clinical chemist to qualify as a lab director.

CALIFORNIA LEGISLATURE--2003Â­04 REGULAR SESSION
ASSEMBLY BILL
No. 1460
Introduced by Assembly Member Nation
February 21, 2003
An act to amend Sections 1209 and 4052.1 of the Business and Professions Code, relating to pharmacists.
LEGISLATIVE COUNSEL'S DIGEST
AB 1460, as introduced, Nation.
Clinical laboratory directors.
Existing law, the Pharmacy Law, provides for the licensure and regulation of pharmacists.
Under that law, a pharmacist is authorized to perform routine patient assessment procedures that are defined, in part, by reference to regulations adopted by a federal agency.
Existing law also provides for the regulation of clinical laboratories and specifies the qualifications required to serve as a laboratory director.
Under existing law, the violation of these provisions is punishable as a crime.
This bill would reflect the change of name of the federal agency that adopted those particular regulations.
The bill would also authorize a pharmacist to be a laboratory director of a clinical laboratory that provides routine patient assessment procedures under designated conditions.
Because the bill would specify these conditions, the violation of which would be punishable as a crime, it would impose a state-mandated local program.
The California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the state.
Statutory provisions establish procedures for making that reimbursement.
This bill would provide that no reimbursement is required by this act for a specified reason.

BILL ANALYSIS
CALIFORNIA STATE BOARD OF PHARMACY VERSION: AS INTRODUCED SPONSOR: CMA, AM CANCER SOCIETY, COMPASSION IN DYING
_____________________________________________________________________________________________
BILL NUMBER: SB 151 AUTHOR: BURTON RECOMMENDED POSITION: SUPPORT
SUBJECT: TRIPLICATE PRESCRIPTIONS ______________________________________________________________________________
Existing Law: 1) Establishes the Controlled Substance Review and Evaluation System (CURES) as a pilot project to electronically monitor the dispensing of Schedule II controlled substances in outpatient pharmacies.
(H
(California Code of Regulations, Title 16, Section 1715.5) 3) Sunsets the CURES pilot project on January 1, 2008.
(H

(H
This Bill: 1) Repeals the triplicate requirement for Schedule II controlled substances.
2) Makes the CURES program permanent.
Comment: 1) Author's Intent.
Medical research has consistently documented that prescription pads issued by law enforcement deters physician prescribing for pain due to physician fears about law enforcement oversight.
California has an electronic monitoring system for Schedule II prescriptions that provides a more effective monitoring system than the carbon copy system adopted in the 1940s.
Pain is an issue that everyone understands and wishes proponents, patients in California experiencing severe pai having their pain treated appropriately.
One of the major fact is that the State of California is one of only three states to avoid.
According to n have a 50-50 chance of reasons for this unfortunate in the nation that require a
special, serialized prescription pad issued by the State Department of Justice in order for physicians to prescribe Schedule II drugs.
2) Prior Legislation.
In 2000, the board sponsored AB 2018 (Thomson) which proposed to repeal the triplicate and make CURES permanent.
AB 2018 was defeated in that form, but ultimately passed and was signed by Governor Davis in an alternate form that reduced the administrative hassles associated with the triplicate prescriptions.
In 2001, Senator Johannessen introduced SB 1000 to make CURES permanent and repeal the triplicate in an early form.
The bill was ultimately amended to state legislative intent to repeal the triplicate and to make further administrative changes to the CURES program.
This bill was supported by the board and vetoed by the Governor.
In 2002, the board sponsored AB 2655 (Matthews) to extend the CURES program and to allow practitioners to access patient information in the CURES system.
That bill was signed by the Governor and took effect on January 1, 2003.
3) Board Policy.
The board has had a long standing policy of supporting the treatment of pain and supportive of repealing the triplicate requirement in California.
The board spearheaded the development of CURES as an electronic replacement for the triplicate monitoring system.
The board provided start up funding for CURES and funding for the first 5 years of operation through a $1.3 million appropriation from the Pharmacy Board Contingent Fund.

BILL ANALYSIS
CALIFORNIA STATE BOARD OF PHARMACY VERSION: AS INTRODUCED
_____________________________________________________________________________________________
BILL NUMBER: SB 250 AUTHOR: BATTIN SPONSOR: AUTHOR
RECOMMENDED POSITION: SUPPORT SUBJECT: CHILD ABUSE REPORTING _____________________________________________________________________________________________
Existing Law: 1) Defines any licensed health professional (including pharmacists) as a mandated reporter of suspected child abuse.
(Penal Code 11165.7) 2) Requires mandated reporters to report any observed or reasonably suspected incidences of child abuse or neglect encountered in the scope of their professional duties.
(Penal Code 11166) 3) Specifies that failure to report is punishable by 6 months in jail or a $1,000 fine, or both.
(Penal Code 11166.5)
This Bill: Requires licensing boards to revoke the license of any licensee who fails to report child abuse.
(Penal Code 11166)
Comment: 1) Author's Intent.
The author is responding to a number of cases in his district where health practitioners have failed to report suspected child abuse.
The author believes that such a failure to report justifies the revocation of a professional license.
2) Mandated Reporters.
As health care practitioners, pharmacists do have a legal obligation to report suspected child abuse or neglect to the appropriate local authority.
However, most pharmacists are not in positions where they are likely to encounter evidence of child abuse or neglect.
Board staff does not recall any complaints related to a failure to report suspected child abuse.

SENATE BILL
No. 250
Introduced by Senator Battin
February 18, 2003
An act to amend Sections 11165.7 and 11166 of the Penal Code, relating to mandated reporters.
LEGISLATIVE COUNSEL'S DIGEST
SB 250, as introduced, Battin.
Mandated reporters.
Existing law, the Child Abuse and Neglect Reporting Act (CANRA), requires a mandated reporter, as defined, to report whenever he or she, in his or her professional capacity or within the scope of his or her employment, has knowledge of or observes a child whom the mandated reporter knows or reasonably suspects has been the victim of child abuse or neglect.
Failure to report an incident is a crime punishable by imprisonment in a county jail for a period of 6 months, a fine of up to $1,000, or by both that imprisonment and fine.
This bill would add receptionists or administrative employees of a hospital or health facility, as defined, to the list of individuals who are mandated reporters.
This bill would also provide that if a person issued a license or certificate to engage in a profession or occupation, the members of which are required to make reports pursuant to this section, fails to report an incident of known or reasonably suspected child abuse or neglect, as required, the failure to report is grounds for revocation of his or her license or certificate.
Because this bill would require employees of local agencies to perform a higher level of service and change the definition of a crime, it would impose a state-mandated local program.
The California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the state.
Statutory provisions establish procedures for making that 99
SB 250
--2--
reimbursement, including the creation of a State Mandates Claims Fund to pay the costs of mandates that do not exceed $1,000,000 statewide and other procedures for claims whose statewide costs exceed $1,000,000.
This bill would provide that with regard to certain mandates no reimbursement is required by this act for a specified reason.
With regard to any other mandates, this bill would provide that, if the Commission on State Mandates determines that the bill contains costs so mandated by the state, reimbursement for those costs shall be made pursuant to the statutory provisions noted above.
Vote: majority.
Appropriation: no.
Fiscal committee: yes.
State-mandated local program: yes.
The people of the State of California do enact as follows: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 SECTION 1.

Comment: 1) Author's Intent.
The author introduced this bill in response to the continuing problem of medication errors.
The bill proposes the color image of the pill as an additional check for both the pharmacist dispensing the medication and the patient taking the medication.
The bill was introduced to stimulate discussion about how to decrease the incidence of wrong drug medication errors.
The author indicates that one major chain currently includes a black and white image of the pill on the receipt for a prescription and that existing Oregon regulations require either an image or a written description of the pill on the prescription label.
The author has not determined what the start-up costs would be to implement the bill's requirements.
2) Other Forms.
The bill only contemplates drugs delivered in tablet or capsule form.
A provision for exempting other forms or addressing the imaging of other forms of drugs (inhalants, injectables, eye drops, etc.) needs to be included.

SENATE BILL
No. 292
Introduced by Senator Speier
February 19, 2003
An act to amend Section 4076 of the Business and Professions Code, relating to pharmacy.
LEGISLATIVE COUNSEL'S DIGEST
SB 292, as introduced, Speier.
Pharmacy: prescription labels.
Under the Pharmacy Law, a pharmacist is required to dispense a prescription in a container that is correctly labeled.
Existing law generally makes it a misdemeanor to knowingly violate the Pharmacy Law.
This bill would require the label to have a color image of the tablet or capsule of the drug.
Because a knowing violation of the bill would be a misdemeanor, it would impose a state-mandated local program.
The California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the state.
Statutory provisions establish procedures for making that reimbursement.
This bill would provide that no reimbursement is required by this act for a specified reason.
Vote: majority.
Appropriation: no.

Comment: 1) Author's Intent.
The author is seeking to apply the model TCT program evaluated in a study project at Cedars Sinai Medical Center and Long Beach Memorial Hospital.
The results of that study were published in the American Journal of Health System Pharmacy (attached) and found the practice to be safe and that TCT allowed staff pharmacists to spend more time addressing clinical issues with patients and prescribers.
2) Board History.
At its October 2001 meeting, the board voted to support legislation that would allow a pharmacy technician to check another pharmacy technician filling unit-dose cassettes in an inpatient hospital pharmacy.
At that meeting the board expressed a desire for TCT programs to emulate those operated by Cedars-Sinai and Long Beach Memorial under the board waiver.
3) Regulations.
The bill requires the board to adopt regulations specifying the criteria for TCT training programs.
Such a requirement would both add workload for the board and delay implementation of TCT for at least one year due to the timeframes required in the rulemaking process.
Placing these criteria in statute using the training programs developed by Cedars-Sinai and Long Beach Memorial as a guide would both save board resources and speed implementation of TCT.
Suggested Amendment #1 - The bill should be amended to remove the requirement for the board to adopt these criteria by regulation and the criteria should be added to the bill.
4) Records.
The bill requires that TCT data and records be retained in the hospital for at least three years.
Suggested Amendment #3 Â­ The bill should be amended to require that the records are readily retrievable by the pharmacy.
This is the same standard applied to other pharmacy records.

SENATE BILL
No. 393
Introduced by Senator Aanestad
February 20, 2003
An act to add Article 7.6 (commencing with Section 4128) to Chapter 9 of Division 2 of the Business and Professions Code, relating to pharmacists.
LEGISLATIVE COUNSEL'S DIGEST
SB 393, as introduced, Aanestad.
Pharmacists: in-patient pharmacy technician services.
Existing law, the Pharmacy Law, authorizes the California State Board of Pharmacy to regulate, license, register, and discipline pharmacists and pharmacy technicians.
Existing law authorizes a pharmacy technician working in an inpatient hospital or a correctional facility to perform nondiscretionary tasks only while assisting, and while under the direct supervision and control of, a pharmacist.
This bill would authorize a general acute care hospital to implement and operate a program using specially trained pharmacy technicians to check the work of other pharmacy technicians who have filled floor and ward stock and unit dose distribution systems for patients whose pharmacy prescriptions have been previously reviewed by a licensed pharmacist.
The bill would require a hospital that operates this program to keep a list of all qualified pharmacy technicians available for board inspection and to keep all required data in the hospital for at least 3 years.
Existing law makes it a misdemeanor to knowingly violate the Pharmacy Law.
Because violations of this bill would be a misdemeanor, the bill would impose a state-mandated local program.
The California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the state.
99
SB 393

Statutory provisions establish procedures for making that reimbursement.
This bill would provide that no reimbursement is required by this act for a specified reason.
Vote: majority.
Appropriation: no.

The people of the State of California do enact as follows: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 SECTION 1.
The Legislature finds and declares that: (a) Pharmacists have emerged as critical members of a medical team by providing services such as patient education, drug therapy monitoring, and pharmacokinetic consultations.
Pharmacists often work side by side with physicians and nurses, and participate in medical rounds.
Pharmacists play an integral role in ensuring a safe medication use process.
Through interpretation, evaluation, and clarification of orders, pharmacists ensure the absence of drug allergies, interactions, duplications, and the optimal selection of dose, dosage form, frequency, route, and duration of therapy.
(b) There currently exists a shortage of pharmacists in the State, and this shortage has the potential to cause harm to patients because hospitals lack sufficient staffing to fully take advantage of clinical pharmacy programs that have been shown to reduce the number of medication errors in hospitals and improve patient outcomes.
(c) Studies authorized by the California State Board of Pharmacy, and conducted under the direction of the University of California, San Francisco, at major California hospitals, have established that certain non-discretionary functions currently performed by pharmacists in the hospital setting can safely be performed by properly trained pharmacy technicians.
Specifically, allowing properly trained pharmacy technicians to check certain tasks performed by other pharmacy technicians is a safe and efficient use of staff, and frees pharmacists to provide the more important and skilled clinical pharmacy services that are critical to quality patient care and the reduction of medication errors.
(d) Pharmacists are substantially over-qualified for performing these non-discretionary in-patient checking functions, and current rules that require pharmacists to perform these functions

SB 393
unnecessarily limit hospitals in their capacity to fully provide patients with clinical pharmacy services.
(e) It is the intent of the Legislature in enacting this act that pharmacists remain responsible for pharmacy operations.
Nothing in these provisions should be interpreted to eliminate or minimize the role of pharmacists in directly supervising pharmacy technicians and pharmacy operations.
It is the further intent of the Legislature that hospitals take advantage of the efficiencies created by these provisions by using properly trained pharmacy technicians for certain non-discretionary checking functions and more completely utilize the training and skills of their pharmacist staff to implement and expand clinical pharmacy programs at their facilities.

CALIFORNIA STATE BOARD OF PHARMACY VERSION: AS INTRODUCED SPONSOR: PUBLIC HEALTH INSTITUTE
_____________________________________________________________________________________________
BILL NUMBER: SB 490 AUTHOR: ALPERT RECOMMENDED POSITION: NONE
SUBJECT: EMERGENCY CONTRACEPTION ______________________________________________________________________________
Existing Law: 1) Permits pharmacists to dispense emergency contraception without a prescription if a protocol is established with a prescriber.
(B
(B
(B
This Bill: Provides that a pharmacist may dispense emergency contraception either under a protocol with a physician or pursuant to a protocol developed by the board.
(B
Comment: 1) Author's Intent.
The author intends to further expand access to emergency contraception therapy.
Two years after the passage of SB 1169 permitted pharmacists to dispense emergency contraception under protocol, there are still 12 counties where no pharmacist is dispensing emergency contraception under protocol and 85% of the protocols established are with prescribers affiliated with Planned Parenthood.
Physicians are citing liability concerns when refusing to establish such a protocol with pharmacists.
The establishment of a statewide protocol would eliminate this barrier to access.
New Mexico has such a statewide protocol in place.
The author anticipates amending the bill to assure broad participation in the protocol development process by physician organizations.
2) Emergency Contraception.
Emergency contraception (EC) drug therapy, commonly referred to as the "morning after pill" are hormone pills that when taken within 72 hours of unprotected intercourse, reduce the chance of a woman becoming
pregnant by about 75 percent.
The hormones are regular birth control pills containing estrogen and progestin, taken in two doses.
In California and Washington, there is also available an EC pill known as "Plan B" made from synthetic progestin.
The EC pills provide a short, high burst of hormone exposure that disrupts the hormone patterns essential for pregnancy.
The EC pills reduce the hormone release from the ovary and the development of the uterine lining is disturbed, the disruptions are temporary, however, lasting only a few days.
Depending on the time during the menstrual cycle when the EC pills are taken, they prevent pregnancy by inhibiting or delaying ovulation, or altering the lining of the uterus thereby inhibiting implantation of a fertilized egg.
The EC pills can also prevent sperm from fertilizing an egg.
EC pills do not cause an abortion.
Because implantation occurs five to seven days after fertilization, EC pills work before implantation and not after a woman is already pregnant.
3) Legislative History.
Senate Bill 1169 (Chapter 900, Statutes of 2001) established the authority for pharmacists to dispense emergency contraception without a prescription.
The board supported that legislation.
4) Related Legislation.
Senator Jackie Speier introduced Senate Bill 545 in the current legislative session which prohibits pharmacists from charging a consultation fee for emergency contraception that exceeds the dispensing fee provided by Medi-Cal. 5) New Mexico.
New Mexico has adopted a statewide protocol for pharmacists dispensing emergency contraception as proposed by this bill.
That protocol was developed by the state board of pharmacy in conjunction with the state medical board and the state nursing board.
A copy of that protocol is attached for your reference.

(16CCR1780.1)
This Bill: Prohibits vet retailers from dispensing injectable or oral antibiotics.
(B
Comment: 1) Author's Intent.
The author introduced this bill to address the issue of the extensive use of antibiotics in food-animals and how these practices contribute to antibiotic resistance.
The bill is in a very early form and the author expects substantial amendments focusing on how to improve the handling and dispensing of drugs by veterinary food-animal drug retailers.
As written, the bill would require that antibiotics for food-animals be labeled and distributed by either a pharmacy or a veterinarian instead of a veterinary food-animal drug retailer.
2) Antibiotic Resistance.
According to the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), disease-causing microbes that have become resistant to drug therapy are an increasing public health problem.
Tuberculosis, gonorrhea, malaria, and childhood ear infections are just a few of the diseases that have become hard to treat with antibiotic drugs.
The increase in antibiotic resistance is due largely to the increasing use of antibiotics.
The FDA also notes the following: Â· Though food-producing animals are given antibiotic drugs for important therapeutic, disease prevention or production reasons, these drugs have the
Â· Â· Â·
downside of potentially causing microbes to become resistant to drugs used to treat human illness, ultimately making some human sicknesses harder to treat.
About 70 percent of bacteria that cause infections in hospitals are resistant to at least one of the drugs most commonly used to treat infections.
Some organisms are resistant to all approved antibiotics and must be treated with experimental and potentially toxic drugs.
Some research has shown that antibiotics are given to patients more often than guidelines set by federal and other healthcare organizations recommend.

An act to amend Section 4053 of the Business and Professions Code, relating to pharmaceuticals.
LEGISLATIVE COUNSEL'S DIGEST
SB 506, as introduced, Sher.
Veterinary food-animal drug retailers.
The Pharmacy Law makes it unlawful for any person other than a pharmacist to compound or dispense a dangerous drug or device, or to compound or dispense a prescription.
Existing law provides exemptions from this prohibition for specified persons, including a veterinary food-animal drug retailer under certain circumstances.
This bill would prohibit a veterinary food-animal drug retailer from applying for an exemption to distribute oral or injectable antibiotics.
Because violations of this bill would be a misdemeanor, the bill would impose a state-mandated local program.
The California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the state.
Statutory provisions establish procedures for making that reimbursement.
This bill would provide that no reimbursement is required by this act for a specified reason.

Comment:
1) Author's Intent.
The author introduced this bill to assure the broadest possible access to emergency contraception.
The sponsor believes that the charging of additional "consultation" fees to emergency contraception patients poses a barrier to access to emergency contraception for those patients who do not have a drug benefit covering emergency contraception.
The sponsor characterizes this practice as discriminatory and contends that emergency contraception therapy does not require a consultation beyond that required for any new prescription.
2) Emergency Contraception.
Emergency contraception (EC) drug therapy, commonly referred to as the "morning after pill" are hormone pills that when taken within 72 hours of unprotected intercourse, reduce the chance of a woman becoming pregnant by about 75 percent.
The hormones are regular birth control pills containing estrogen and progestin, taken in two doses.
In California and Washington, there is also available an EC pill known as "Plan B" made from synthetic progestin.
The EC pills provide a short, high burst of hormone exposure that disrupts the hormone patterns essential for pregnancy.
The EC pills reduce the hormone release from the ovary and the development of the uterine lining is disturbed, the disruptions are temporary, however, lasting only a few days.
Depending on the time during the menstrual cycle when the EC pills are taken, they prevent pregnancy by inhibiting or delaying ovulation, or altering the lining of the uterus thereby inhibiting implantation of a fertilized egg.
The EC pills can also prevent sperm from fertilizing an egg.
EC pills do not cause an abortion.
Because implantation occurs five to seven days after fertilization, EC pills work before implantation and not after a woman is already pregnant.
3) Legislative History.
Senate Bill 1169 (Chapter 900, Statutes of 2001) established the authority for pharmacists to dispense emergency contraception without a prescription.

SENATE BILL
No. 545
Introduced by Senator Speier
February 20, 2003
An act to amend Section 4052 of, and to add Section 4427 to, the Business and Professions Code, relating to pharmacists.
LEGISLATIVE COUNSEL'S DIGEST
SB 545, as introduced, Speier.
Emergency contraception drug therapy.
Existing Law, the Pharmacy Law, provides for the licensing and regulation of the practice of pharmacy under the jurisdiction of the California State Board of Pharmacy.
Existing law requires a pharmacist to provide consultation when furnishing drugs, with certain exceptions, and the board has set forth specific requirements applicable to the provision of consultation and the maintenance of patient medication records.
Existing law authorizes a pharmacist, in addition to other functions, to initiate emergency contraception drug therapy if the pharmacist has completed a training program on emergency contraception and certain other conditions are met.
This bill would remove this training requirement.
The bill would also state that the provisions authorizing the initiation of emergency contraception drug therapy do not impose a duty on a pharmacist to provide consultation different from or to maintain patient medication records that differ from that which is generally required by the board's regulations.
The bill would, however, require a pharmacist to ask questions necessary to determine a patient's eligibility for the therapy.
The bill would also prohibit a pharmacist from charging a separate consultation fee for the initiation of emergency contraception drug therapy.
99
SB 545
--2--
Existing law provides for the Medi-Cal program, administered by the State Department of Health Services, under which qualified low-income persons are provided with health care services, including prescription benefits.
Under existing law, the department pays participating pharmacists a discounted price for drugs on the Medi-Cal drug formulary.
This bill would require a pharmacy that participates in the Medi-Cal program to offer the initiation of emergency contraception drug therapy.
The bill would prohibit a pharmacist initiating emergency contraception drug therapy from charging a dispensing fee in excess of the dispensing fee charged to Medi-Cal patients.
Existing law makes it a misdemeanor to knowingly violate the Pharmacy Law.
All other violations of that law are infractions unless otherwise indicated.
Because this bill would create new prohibitions on pharmacists, the violation of which would be a crime, the bill would impose a state-mandated local program.
The California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the state.
Statutory provisions establish procedures for making that reimbursement.
This bill would provide that no reimbursement is required by this act for a specified reason.
Vote: majority.
Appropriation: no.
Fiscal committee: yes.
State-mandated local program: yes.
The people of the State of California do enact as follows: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 SECTION 1.
It is the intent of the Legislature to ensure equality of access to pharmaceuticals for the women of California.
In ensuring that access, the Legislature intends to eliminate discriminatory practices relating to emergency contraception, which treat women differently from other classes of patients who receive their prescriptions through pharmacies.

Comment: 1) Author's Intent.
The author seeks to increase access to hypodermic needles and syringes.
The author points out numerous studies establishing the link between HIV transmission and intravenous drug use.
These same studies indicate that the use of sterile syringes greatly reduces the transmission of HIV and other diseases among intravenous drug users.
A bulletin supported by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services called for the use of a new, sterile syringe for each injection by drug users.
A coalition of health organizations including the American Medical Association, National Association of Boards of Pharmacy, and the American Pharmaceutical Association recommends that states take action to make clean needles and syringes available to intravenous drug users.
2) Previous Legislation.
Assembly Bill 136 (Chapter 762, Statutes of 1999) removed potential criminal prosecution for clean needle exchange programs operated by public entities or the agents of public entities.
Legislation in that same session that exempted needles distributed in a clean needle program operated by a public entity from the prescription requirement was rejected by the Governor.
Assembly Bill 1292 of 2001 proposed repealing the regulation of needles by the board.
That bill was amended to a form substantially similar to this legislation.
The bill was supported by the board subject to inclusion of amendments to resolve technical issues and repealing the requirement to issue a hypodermic permit.
The bill was not taken to a hearing at the request of the author.
In 2002, Senator John Vasconcellos introduced Senate Bill 1785 which eliminated the prescription requirement for needles and syringes and instead required that they only be sold by a pharmacist.
The bill also limited the quantity sold to 30 needles per purchase.
That bill was supported by the board and vetoed by the Governor.
The
veto message is provided below: To the Members of the California State Senate: I am returning Senate Bill 1785 without my signature.
SB 1785 would authorize pharmacists and physicians to furnish hypodermic needles or syringes for human use without a prescription.
In addition, persons who are 18 years of age or older would be able to possess up to 30 hypodermic needles or syringes.
I am committed to the underlying goal of the bill which is to reduce the transmission of HIV and hepatitis C among injection drug users, and I am proud of the progress we have made in combating these two diseases.
California spends $93.2 million on education and prevention programs and I have added millions of dollars in the Office of AIDS for behavioral and early intervention, programs for high-risk youth, communities of color and HIV prevention evaluation.
I have strongly supported our new HIV reporting system which will reveal trends in HIV transmission and assist in targeting HIV education, prevention and care efforts.
I have signed legislation that already makes hypodermic needles and syringes available from authorized, legally sanctioned syringe exchange programs located throughout California.
In Spring 2000, the Department of Health Services appointed the Hepatitis C Working Group, comprised of key stakeholders from the public and private sectors.
The Working Group developed the first-ever hepatitis C strategic plan for California.
In August 2000, I signed SB 1256 (Polanco) which allocated $1.5 million for hepatitis C outreach and education.
I worked hard with the author of the legislation I signed in 1999 to bring law enforcement and health officials together on a bill that would decriminalize supervised needle exchange programs.
This bill undermines the key elements that won my support for that legislation: * It eliminates the requirement for a one-for-one exchange of syringes, which is the standard of practice in authorized needle exchange programs.
* By eliminating the one-on-one exchange, this bill eliminates the ability to focus aggressive intervention efforts toward getting drug addicts into treatment.
* It eliminates the requirement that needle exchange programs be conducted with local government approval, ongoing oversight and as the result of a declared health emergency.
Additionally, this bill could potentially increase the amount of contaminated needles and syringes in parks, beaches and other public areas.
This would place the non-injection drug using population at greater risk for HIV, hepatitis C, and other blood-borne diseases.
While I appreciate the author's hard work and dedication to this issue, I cannot sign this measure.
The board supported SB 1785.
3) Related Legislation.
Assembly Bill 1363 (Berg) also repeals the prescription requirement and establishes more detailed authority for government operated needle exchange programs.
4) Hypodermic Permits.
Currently any entity furnishing needles at retail must have either a pharmacy or hypodermic permit from the board.
This bill would alter that and require all needles furnished for human use to be distributed by a pharmacy.
Hypodermic permits would still be required to furnish needles for animal use (existing law exempts needles furnished for industrial use and this bill retains that exemption).

LEGISLATIVE COUNSEL'S DIGEST
SB 774, as introduced, Vasconcellos.
Hypodermic needles and syringes.
(1) Existing law regulates the sale, possession, and disposal of hypodermic needles and syringes.
Under existing law, a prescription is required to purchase a hypodermic needle or syringe for human use, except to administer adrenaline or insulin.
This bill would authorize a licensed pharmacist to sell hypodermic needles or syringes to a person without a prescription under specified conditions.
(2) Existing law requires a person to properly establish his or her identity in order to purchase a needle or syringe.
Existing law requires a pharmacist to keep detailed records of nonprescription sales of hypodermic needles and syringes.
This bill would delete both the identity requirement and the requirement that a pharmacist keep detailed records of nonprescription sales of hypodermic needles and syringes.
(3) Existing law prohibits the possession and sale of drug paraphernalia.
This bill would authorize a person to possess up to 30 hypodermic needles or syringes if acquired through an authorized source.

The Legislature finds and declares all of the following: (a) Injection drug use is linked to 19 percent of all AIDS cases and one-half of all hepatitis C cases in California.
Injection drug users become infected and transmit diseases such as HIV and hepatitis C to others by sharing blood-contaminated syringes. (b) The lifetime cost of treating one person with AIDS is estimated to be over one hundred ninety-five thousand dollars ($195,000). (c) According to the California Department of Health Services, 500,000 to 600,000 Californians are estimated to have contracted hepatitis C, a disease for which there is no known cure. (d) The United States Public Health Service and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommend that injection drug users who cannot or will not stop injecting drugs use a sterile needle for every injection as a public health measure to limit blood-borne disease transmission.
(e) Current California law requiring a prescription for the purchase of syringes and restricting the possession of syringes presents a formidable obstacle to disease prevention and threatens public safety.
California is only one of six states that requires a prescription to purchase a syringe.
(f) Legislation to permit the pharmacy-based sale of sterile syringes without a prescription would reduce new cases of HIV, 99

State of California Memorandum To: From: Legislation and Regulation Committee Paul Riches Legislative Analyst
Department of Consumer Affairs
Date: March 17, 2003
Subject: Veterinary Drugs Senator Sheila Kuehl has introduced Senate Bill 175 to clarify the board's jurisdiction as it relates to "veterinary drugs."
The board has jurisdiction over "dangerous drugs" as defined in Business and Professions Code 4022.
That section explicitly exempts "veterinary drugs" from the definition of "dangerous drugs" and thus from the board's jurisdiction.
Much of the confusion related to this issue revolves around the usage and definition of those terms.
The term "veterinary drug" has been used with a number of different meanings.
Some believe it to be any drug prescribed by a veterinarian.
However, many of the drugs prescribed by veterinarians are actually drugs approved for use in humans and other drugs are used by veterinarians that are specifically approved by the FDA for use in animals upon the prescription of a veterinarian.
The board believes that the term "veterinary drug" to mean those drugs approved by the FDA for animal use and that the term "dangerous drug" means those drugs approved by the FDA for use in humans when prescribed by an appropriately licensed health professional.
Under the board's interpretation, it currently has jurisdiction over drugs prescribed by veterinarians when they are drugs approved for use by humans (dangerous drugs) for use in animals.
For example, veterinarians use many of the same antibiotics to treat infections that are used by physicians to treat humans.
It does not have jurisdiction when veterinarians prescribe drugs approved for animal use.
It is also worth noting that veterinarians currently are not subject to the prescriber dispensing laws that apply to other prescribers (physicians, dentists, etc.).
Board staff has proposed a number of technical amendments to the bill (a bill analysis and the text of the proposed amendments are attached for your reference) and the author has indicated that they will accept those amendments.
These amendments include adding veterinarians to the prescriber dispensing statute.

CALIFORNIA STATE BOARD OF PHARMACY VERSION: AS INTRODUCED SPONSOR: CAL.
VET MED ASSN
______________________________________________________________________________ BILL NUMBER: SB 175 AUTHOR: KUEHL
RECOMMENDED POSITION: SUPPORT IF AMENDED SUBJECT: VETERINARY DRUGS ______________________________________________________________________________
Existing Law: 1) Defines "dangerous drugs" as those drugs for human use that require a prescription.
(B
3) Excludes veterinarians from pharmacy law provisions relating to prescriber dispensing.
(B
This Bill: 1) Redefines "dangerous drugs" to include veterinary drugs.

(B
Comment: 1) Author's Intent.
The author introduced the bill to clarify existing law as it relates to the regulation of veterinary drugs by the Board of Pharmacy.
2) Veterinary Drugs.
The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approves drugs for veterinary use separately from those for human use.
These drugs are approved for use in animals only upon a veterinarian's prescription.
These drugs are excluded from the definition of "dangerous drugs" in Business and Professions Section 4022.
The board is required to regulate dangerous drugs as defined in Section 4022 and cannot regulate a drug that does not meet the definition.
There are also a range of veterinary drugs approved for over-the-counter (OTC) sales that are chemically identical to human drugs available only by prescription.
These drugs are commonly sold in pet and feed stores.
The board is prohibited from regulating OTC drugs by Business and Professions Code Section 4057.

However, many drugs used in animals are drugs approved by the FDA for human use.
These drugs (e.g., antibiotics, analgesics, etc) are dosed for animals but are the same drugs used to treat humans.
These drugs are within the board's jurisdiction because they meet the definition of dangerous drugs in Section 4022.
As drafted, SB 175 would broaden the board's regulatory authority to include veterinary drugs and would subject veterinarians to board enforcement action.
Existing law and board practice is to share jurisdiction over prescriber dispensing cases with the appropriate licensing board.
The board is presently engaged in a discussion regarding the enforcement of prescriber dispensing laws with the Medical Board of California.
3) Statutory History.
In 1980 the section of law defining "dangerous drugs" (now Section 4022) was completely rewritten.
Prior to that change, the section listed specific drugs that were dangerous drugs and exempted certain veterinary drugs from that definition.
However, the 1980 revisions established a blanket exemption for all veterinary drugs.
This change was characterized at the time as a technical change to streamline the law and follow federally established drug designations in place of the specific listing in current law.
Existing law identifies veterinarians as prescribers (B
Among the requirements under the prescriber dispensing statutes is that prescribers must allow the patient to fill the prescription at a pharmacy of their choosing.
That requirement does not currently apply to veterinarians.
4) Amendments.
Board staff has been engaged in discussions with the Veterinary Medical Board on this issue in recent months.
Attached are amendments to the bill proposed by staff.
These amendments address several technical drafting issues and clarify the meaning of "good faith medical examination" in the board's citation and fine authority relating to internet dispensing to include the definition of that phrase adopted by the Veterinary Medical Board.
