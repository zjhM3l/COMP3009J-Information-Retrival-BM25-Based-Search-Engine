Japanese Laid Open Application 63-316284 (Yoshikawa) Japanese Laid-Open Application 2-249086 (Sugiyama) The Rejections on Appeal
Claims 10-19 stand finally rejected under 35 U.S.C. Â§ 112, first paragraph, as being based on an unenabling disclosure.
In the final Office action (Paper No. 7), claims 1, 2, 4, and 6-19 were finally rejected under 35 U.S.C. Â§ 103 as being unpatentable over Togawa, Sugiyama or Aguro, and Hernandez.
In
the examiner's answer, however, all references to Sugiyama were dropped, and only claims 1, 2, 4, 6-8 and 10-13 are said to be rejected as being unpatentable over Togawa, Aguro and Hernandez.
In a supplemental answer (Paper No. 18), however, the examiner clarified that claims 18 and 19 were rejected on the same ground as well.
Thus, claims 1, 2, 4, 6-8, 10-13, and 18-19 stand
finally rejected over Togawa, Aguro and Hernandez.
In the final Office action (Paper No. 7), claim 3 was finally rejected under 35 U.S.C. Â§ 103 as being unpatentable over Togawa, Sugiyama, Hernandez and Sklarew.
In the examiner's

Appeal No. 95-0175 Application 07/894,147 Opinion We do not sustain the rejection of claims 10-19 under 35 U.S.C. Â§ 112, first paragraph, as being based on an unenabling disclosure.
We sustain the rejection of claims 1, 6-8, 10-13, 15, 16, 18 and 19 under 35 U.S.C. Â§ 103 as being unpatentable over prior art.
We do not sustain the rejection of claims, 2-5, 9, 14 and 17 as being unpatentable over prior art.
The rejection based on 35 U.S.C. Â§ 112, first paragraph The examiner has rejected claims 10-19 as being based on an unenabling disclosure.
The test for enablement under 35 U.S.C.
Â§ 112, first paragraph, is whether one reasonably skilled in the art could make or use the claimed invention from the disclosed subject matter together with information in the art without undue experimentation.

The issue is whether

In re Vaeck,
947 F.2d 488, 495, 20 USPQ2d 1438, 1444 (Fed.
Cir. 1991).
Here, the examiner has made no explanation whatsoever as to what experimentation would be required by one with ordinary skill in the art in order to make and use the claimed invention, and also no explanation as to why any such experimentation would be undue.
Accordingly, the rejection of the claims as being based
on unenabling disclosure cannot be sustained.
It appears, however, that the examiner intended to reject the claims as being without written description support in the specification.
The written description requirement is also a But it is

separate and apart from the enabling disclosure requirement.
In re Wilder, 736 F.2d 1516, 1520, 222 USPQ 369, 372 (Fed.
Cir. 1984).
The purpose of the written description requirement is
broader than to merely explain how to make and use the claimed invention.
Rather, the applicant must also convey with
reasonable clarity to those skilled in the art that, as of the filing date sought, he or she was in possession of the invention.

Cir. 1983); In re Smythe, 480 F.2d 1376, 1382, 178 USPQ 279, 284 (CCPA 1973).
Even assuming that the examiner's rejection is for lack of written description in the specification, it cannot be sustained.
The examiner's position is that claim 10 requires a "sensor" for the shapes of inscribed characters and a "comparator" for the stored signals and signals from the sensor.
Satisfaction of the
written description requirement does not require the description to be in ipsis verbis antecedence in the originally filed application.
(CCPA 1971).
In re Lukach, 442 F.2d 967, 969, 169 USPQ 795, 796 In our view, and in the context of this case, if
the required sensing and comparing functions are performed, even if the appellants have not used the exact words "sensor" and "comparator" to describe the circuit or apparatus which performs the functions, the rejection for lack of written description support is without merit.
In the specification at pages 8-9, it is stated: The arrangement is such that, when the stylus pen 15 is moved on the tablet 14 across the display unit 2, a position designated by the stylus pen 15 is detected in terms of x and y coordinate values.
. . .
* * *
. . .
More specifically, after the entry of handwritten characters by the stylus pen 15 is commenced beginning from one of the character frames 17, any 7
Appeal No. 95-0175 Application 07/894,147 movement of the stylus pen in the "up" state exterior of a character box 17 is regarded as completion of writing of one character, thus out such individuals characters in one-by-one to the being cutting fashion.
The above-quoted written description reveals that the appellants were in possession of the subject matter of sensing the shape of inscribed characters.
Note that the position of the pen before
it is lifted is detected in terms of x and y coordinate values.
That the specification refers to circuitry which detects the position of the stylus pen as a "character cut-out portion" does not detract from its sufficiently supporting the term "sensor" as is broadly claimed by the appellants.
In the specification at page 10, it is stated: The character recognition portion 5 recognizes the cut-out hand-written character pattern and extracts a plurality of candidate characters having configurations similar to that of the recognized hand-written character pattern, and stores in the recognition result memory 6 the codes corresponding to these candidate characters in the order of closeness of similarity.
* * *
. . .
More specifically, the writing of the image data is conducted such that a standard character pattern corresponding to the first candidate character exhibiting the highest degree of similarity is written in an area in the frame memory 8 corresponding to the character box 17, and that standard character patterns corresponding to the plurality of candidate characters are stored in later-mentioned candidate character boxes provided in the window memory 9.
8
Appeal No. 95-0175 Application 07/894,147 In the specification at page 14, it is stated: The character recognition portion 5 examines the character pattern 19 to recognize it as a character, and operates to extract a plurality of, five in this case, candidate characters in the order of degree of similarity.
. . .
The above-quoted disclosure reveals that the appellants were in possession of the idea of comparing the sensed input signal with stored potential character signals to derive plural candidate characters.
This disclosure adequately supports the
term comparator as broadly recited in the appellants' claims.
That the specification refers to a "character recognition portion" rather than a "comparator" does not establish lack of written description for a comparator.
It is implicit that the
character recognition portion 5 includes such a comparator.
For the foregoing reasons, the rejection of claims 10-19 as being based on an unenabling disclosure cannot be sustained.
Moreover, even if the rejection had been one for lack of written description under 35 U.S.C. Â§ 112, first paragraph, it also cannot be sustained.
The rejection of claims 1, 2, 4, 6-8, 10-13 and 18-19 under 35 U.S.C. Â§ 103 over prior art Our opinion is based solely on the arguments raised by the appellants in their briefs.
We do not address and offer no
9
Appeal No. 95-0175 Application 07/894,147 opinion on arguments which could have been raised but were not set forth in the briefs.
With respect to independent claims 1, 10 and 15, the appellants argue that the applied prior art nowhere suggests placing the candidate character display area "to abut" the input character display area (Br. at 7, line 5).
The appellants argue
that the abutting feature is not disclosed in any of the references (Br. at 8, lines 8-10).
Also, the appellants state
that the prior art requires an operator to move a stylus a substantial distance from the region where the candidate character was inscribed to a region that is removed from the inscribed region (Br. at 7, lines 15-17).
According to the
appellants, the abutting feature provides character recognition without requiring an operator to frequently turn his eyes and frequently move the position of a stylus (Br. at 7, lines 22-23).
Also according to the appellants, the abutting feature would require less space on the display device for the candidate display area (Br. at 8, lines 1-3).
It is true that none of Togawa, Aguro, and Hernandez expressly discloses displaying candidate characters in a display area abutting that area for displaying the inscribed character.
10
Appeal No. 95-0175 Application 07/894,147 However, the appellants have overlooked that the rejection is one for obviousness based on 35 U.S.C. Â§ 103, not anticipation under 35 U.S.C. Â§ 102.
Hernandez discloses an interactive graphical object display and editing system, wherein various editing functions can be applied to multiple objects being displayed on the screen.
According to Hernandez, it is disadvantageous to have the editing function choices displayed in a fixed area on the bottom of the screen well removed from the location of the graphical objects.
From column 2, line 67 to column 3, line 2, Hernandez states: The operator should not be required to move the point of action from the graphic object to the bottom of the screen and back to the object merely to select a different editing action.
To achieve the above-stated goal, Hernandez displays its menu of editing functions wherever the user places the cursor on the screen (column 5, lines 39-42).
According to Hernandez, the
editing function menu is usually displayed in a blank area of the screen (column 5, lines 37-38).
Thereafter, Hernandez selects
one of the displayed editing functions and then places the cursor next to that graphic object to which the selected editing function will be applied so that the object can be selected (column 5, lines 43-64).
Figure 4 illustrates where the editing
menu is displayed in one particular instance.
11
Appeal No. 95-0175 Application 07/894,147 The appellants argue that Hernandez's editing menu has nothing to do with hand-written input character recognition and thus its teachings about where to place the editing menu for graphical objects are not applicable to character recognition systems such as that disclosed in Togawa or Aguro (Br. page 9, line 21 to page 10, line 5).
The appellants further argue that
Hernandez teaches only the placing of the menu at where the cursor is and not the "abutting" relationship called for by the claims (Br. at 10, lines 7-12).
In our view, both of the appellants' arguments are misplaced and without merit.
First, it should be noted that a reference
must be considered for everything it teaches by way of technology and is not limited to the particular invention it is describing and attempting to protect.
EWP Corp. v. Reliance Universal Inc.,
755 F.2d 898, 907, 225 USPQ 20, 25 (Fed.
Cir.), cert. denied, 474 U.S. 843 (1985).
A reference must be evaluated for all its In re
teachings and is not limited to its specific embodiments.
Bode, 550 F.2d 656, 661, 193 USPQ 12, 17 (CCPA 1977); In re Snow, 471 F.2d 1400, 1403, 176 USPQ 328, 329 (CCPA 1973).
The teaching
value of Hernandez to one with ordinary skill in the art is much more expansive than the appellants realize.
A reasonable reading
of Hernandez by one with ordinary skill in the art would convey
12
Appeal No. 95-0175 Application 07/894,147 the thought that where a plurality of items are for selection in connection with some object displayed on a screen, it would be best to have a selection menu displayed not far and away from the object, but in close proximity in relation thereto.
It would be
unreasonable to limit Hernandez's teaching value to only noncharacter type graphical objects which require on-screen editing.
We do not find that Hernandez constitutes nonanalogous art, since its disclosure is reasonably pertinent to the problem with which the appellants were involved, i.e., frequent turning of the eyes and moving of the stylus away from the point of interest on a screen, albeit in the context of character entry.
Also, the
test for obviousness is not whether the features of one reference may be bodily incorporated into another reference, but whether the combined teachings render the claimed subject matter obvious.
In re Wood, 599 F.2d 1032, 1036, 202 USPQ 171, 174 (CCPA 1979).
Secondly, while Hernandez does not expressly state that the menu can be displayed to abut any particular object, we think it is the natural and next logical step in keeping with the teachings of Hernandez.
Note that in Hernandez the object to be
acted on is not selected until after the editing function has been selected.
Thus, it is not possible to place the editing
function menu in an abutting relationship to the object to be
13
Appeal No. 95-0175 Application 07/894,147 acted on.
However, where the object with respect to which the
menu choices are related is already selected, as is the case in Aguro, it would have been obvious to one with ordinary skill in the art in light of Hernandez to display the menu choices in an abutting relationship to the corresponding object, i.e., the inscribed handwritten character or a representation thereof.
reflects merely a straight forward application of Hernandez's teaching of proximally locating the menu choices to the corresponding object.
We agree with the examiner that in light It
of Hernandez it would have been obvious to one with ordinary skill in the art to modify Aguro so that the candidate character display area abuts the inscribed character display area.
The appellants have grouped claim 18 with claim 1 (Br. at 11) and claim 8 with claim 6 (Br. at 12).
For the foregoing reasons, the rejection of claims 1, 6, 8, 10 and 18 is sustained.
Claim 2 depends from claim 1 and specifically requires that there be a plurality of input character display areas and a candidate character display area for each input character display area.
The appellants argue (Br. at 10-11) that nothing in the
applied references reasonably suggest a candidate character display area for each of a plurality of input character display
14
Appeal No. 95-0175 Application 07/894,147 area.
In response, the examiner does not address the issue
raised by the appellants, but merely reiterate the position that the abutting relationship would have been obvious (answer at 11, lines 7-18).
It appears that Aguro would not have reasonably
suggested the one-to-one fixed relationship between candidate character display areas and input character display areas.
In
Aguro, the graphical objects can be anywhere on the screen and the same is true for its editing function menu.
Because the examiner has not reasonably explained his position concerning the claimed features of claim 2, the rejection of claim 2 cannot be sustained.
Claim 4 depends from
claim 2 and therefore the rejection of claim 4 also cannot be sustained.
Claim 19 depends from claim 1 and recites that the first candidate character is not displayed in the candidate character display area.
It is true that none of the applied references However, we agree with the
specifically teaches this feature.
examiner that this aspect of the claimed invention would have been obvious to one with ordinary skill in the art.
Because the
first candidate character is already displayed in the position corresponding to the position of the inscribed input character, as is evidently already taught by Aguro, one with ordinary skill
15
Appeal No. 95-0175 Application 07/894,147 in the art would readily recognize that it is not necessary to have the first candidate character displayed again, especially in an abutting display area.
It should be noted that one with
ordinary skill in the art is presumed to possess a certain level of common sense and basic skills.
A conclusion of obviousness
may be made from common knowledge and common sense of the person of ordinary skill in the art without any specific hint or suggestion in a particular reference.
In re Bozek, 416 F.2d See also In re
1385, 1390, 163 USPQ 545, 549 (CCPA 1969).
Sovish, 769 F.2d 738, 743, 226 USPQ 771, 774 (Fed.
Cir. 1985) ("This [Applicant's] argument presumes stupidity rather than skill").
The disclosure of a reference is not limited to its E.g., In re Burckel,
preferred embodiments or working examples.
592 F.2d 1175, 1179, 201 USPQ 67, 70 (CCPA 1979); In re Mills, 470 F.2d 649, 651, 176 USPQ 196, 198 (CCPA 1972).
Thus, the rejection of claim 19 is sustained.
Claim 7 depends from claim 6 and recites a step responding to the inscribed character to activate the display so a reproduction of the inscribed character and the candidate characters are displayed on the display in the abutting regions.
In the brief on page 12, lines 12-15, the appellants state that this step permits the operator to see the displayed inscribed
16
Appeal No. 95-0175 Application 07/894,147 character and the candidate characters simultaneously, without movement of his eyes and enables minimum pen movement.
Evidently, this is the same argument as that set forth by the appellants with respect to the independent claims 1, 6 and 10.
Since the rejection of claims 1, 6 and 10 is sustained, the rejection of claim 7 will also be sustained.
Claim 11 depends from claim 10 and further recites that the device responds to the sensor to display the inscribed character on the second region of the display and replace the inscribed character on the second region of the display with the selected character.
The appellants argue (Br. at 13, lines 14-17) that
claim 11 more specifically requires the inscribed character to be replaced by the selected character, which is not shown or suggested by the prior art.
The argument is rejected.
In column 5, lines 19-28 of Togawa, it is disclosed that as the hand-written character is inputted the information for the locus of the input pen is simultaneously displayed and outputted.
Thereafter, according to column 5, lines 38-40 of Togawa, the result recognized by the recognizing unit 14 is displayed instead of the handwritten character.
This description would have
reasonably suggested the feature of claim 11, i.e., the replacing of the inscribed character with the selected character.
17
Appeal No. 95-0175 Application 07/894,147 Thus, we sustain the rejection of claim 11.
Because the
appellants have grouped claims 12 and 13 together with claim 11, we also sustain the rejection of claims 12 and 13.
The rejection of claims 9, 14, and 15-17 as being unpatentable over Togawa, Aguro, Hernandez and Kaplan under 35 U.S.C. Â§ 103 Claim 9 depends from claim 6 and further requires that the candidate character most similar to the inscribed character being displayed closer to the inscribed character than any of the other candidate characters.
Claim 14 depends from claim 10 and further
requires that the candidate character most similar to the inscribed character being displayed closer to the inscribed character than any of the other candidate characters.
Claim 17
depends from claim 15 and further requires that the candidate character most similar to the inscribed character being displayed closer to the inscribed character than any of the other candidate characters.
For this feature of the claimed invention, the However, the reliance is misplaced.
examiner relied on Kaplan.
Kaplan discloses a tutorial device wherein tutorial data is displayed in a first region and a menu of various executable tutorial control functions is displayed in a second region.
In
one of Kaplan's disclosed embodiments, it is indicated that the
18
Appeal No. 95-0175 Application 07/894,147 most frequently used tutorial control function is listed first and the function which is seldomly used is listed last.
column 5, lines 19-24, it is stated: EXAMPLES: By clicking on a pull-down menu item, users could rate how often they need to use that menu choice.
A high rating would cause the menu to rearrange itself so that it appears first on the pulldown menu.
A lower rating would cause the item to appear later in the menu list.
The appellants correctly state that it is not seen why one of ordinary skill in the art would combine Kaplan's tutorial device with the remaining references.
That Kaplan teaches a In
hierarchy of display based on the anticipated frequency of use of tutorial functions such as page forward, page backward, more information, undo, delete, and quit, would not have reasonably suggested a hierarchy of display of candidate characters based on similarity in appearance with respect to inputted handwritten characters.
Extending Kaplan's ideas to cover character
recognition systems such that candidate characters are listed in order of similarity to the inscribed handwritten character involves use of improper hindsight in light of the appellants' own specification.
The connection between anticipated frequency
of use and similarity in appearance to input character is too far stretched and remote to support a conclusion of obviousness.
19
Appeal No. 95-0175 Application 07/894,147 For the foregoing reasons, the rejection of claims 9, 14 and 17 cannot be sustained.
Claim 15 does not require that the candidate characters be displayed such that the one most similar to the inscribed character is placed closest to the inscribed character.
In that
connection, claim 15 is like independent claims 1, 6 and 10.
Thus, although the rejection of claim 15 is nominally based on Togawa, Aguro, Hernandez and Kaplan, Kaplan has no application in the rejection and the rejection is essentially based solely on Togawa, Aguro and Hernandez.
The appellants' arguments with
regard to claim 15 are the same as those set forth in connection with claims 1, 6 and 10.
For reasons the same as those already
discussed above in the context of claims 1, 6 and 10, which have been rejected over Togawa, Aguro and Hernandez, the appellants' arguments are rejected in the context of claim 15 as well.
Accordingly, the rejection of claim 15 is sustained.
Also,
because the appellants have grouped claim 16 together with claim 15 (Br. at 14), the rejection of claim 16 is also sustained.
The rejection of claim 3 over Togawa, Aguro, Hernandez and Sklarew Claim 3 depends from claim 2.
Sklarew was applied by the
examiner for the additional limitation recited in claim 3.
20
Appeal No. 95-0175 Application 07/894,147 Because the rejection of claim 2 is not sustained, the rejection of claim 3 cannot be sustained.
In any event, the examiner has not established that the feature added by claim 3 is either shown or suggested by the disclosure of Sklarew.
Claim 3 recites that a candidate
character display area associated with one of said input character display area is displayed in a window which overlies another input character display area or areas.
Sklarew discloses
a window overlay for inserting text at any position identified on the display.
The text for insertion is original input data the Sklarew would not have
same as the data which was already there.
reasonably suggested how to position a candidate character display area which is associated with a particular input character display area, in the manner as is required by claim 3.
The rejection of claim 5 over Togawa, Aguro, Hernandez and Yoshikawa Claim 5 depends from claim 2.
Yoshikawa was applied by the
examiner for the additional limitation recited in claim 5.
Because the rejection of claim 2 is not sustained, the rejection of claim 5 cannot be sustained.
In any event, the examiner has not sufficiently explained how the added features of claim 5 have been met or reasonably suggested by Yoshikawa.
Claim 5 requires more than mere generic 21
Appeal No. 95-0175 Application 07/894,147 kana to kanji conversion.
The examiner has not explained how
Yoshikawa would reasonably suggest displaying a first candidate kanji character in one of at least two successive input character display areas in which the kana characters being converted into kanji ware supposedly displayed.
It is not clear whether in
Yoshikawa the kana characters inputted by keyboard are even displayed at all.
Yoshikawa is a system for recognizing
handwritten kanji characters and the kana characters inputted by keyboard evidently are used only to help in solving problems when the system initially fails to recognize the inputted handwritten kanji character.
Conclusion The rejection of claims 10-19 under 35 U.S.C. Â§ 112, first paragraph, is reversed.
The rejection of claims 1, 6-8, 10-13, 18 and 19 under 35 U.S.C. Â§ 103 as being unpatentable over Togawa, Aguro and Hernandez is affirmed.
The rejection of claims 2 and 4 under 35 U.S.C. Â§ 103 as being unpatentable over Togawa, Aguro and Hernandez is reversed.
The rejection of claim 3 under 35 U.S.C. Â§ 103 as being unpatentable over Togawa, Aguro, Hernandez and Sklarew is reversed.
