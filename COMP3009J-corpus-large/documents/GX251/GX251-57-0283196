Before that, no star had been added since 1912, when New Mexico and Arizona were admitted to the Union.
The true history of the Stars and Stripes has become so cluttered by myth and tradition that the facts are difficult, and in some cases impossible, to establish.
For example, it is not certain who sesigned the Stars and Stripes, who mad the first such flag, or even whether it ever flew in any sea fight or land battle of the American Revolution.
All agree, however, that the Stars and Stripes originated as the result of a resolution offered by the Marine committee of the Second Continental Congress at Philadelphia and adopted on June 14, 1777.
It read: Resolved: that the flag of the United States be thirteen stripes, alternate red and white; that the union be thirteen stars, white in a blue field, representing a new constellation.
Congress gave no hint as to the designer of the flag, no instructions as to the arrangement of the stars, and no infromation on its appropriate uses.
Historians have been unable to find the orignal flag law.
The resolution establishing the flag was not even published until September 2, 1777.
Despite repeated requests, Washington did not get the flags until 1783, after the American Revolution was over.
And there is no certainty that they were the Stars and Stripes.
Many historians consider the first flag of the U.S. to have been the Grand Union (sometimes called the Great Union) flag, althought the Continental Congress never officially adopted it.
this flag was a modification of the british Meteor flag, which had the red cross of St. George and the white cross of St. Andrew combined in the blue canton. for the Grand Union flag, 6 horizontal stripes were imposed on the red field dividing it into 13 alternating red and white stripes.
On January 1, 1776, when the Continental Army came into formal existence, this flag was unfurled on Prospect Hill, Somerville, MA. Washington wrote that "we hoisted the Union Flag in compliment tot he United Colonies."
One of Several flags about which controvesy has raged for years is at Easton, PA. Containing the devices of the national flag in reversed order, this flag has been in the public library at Easton for more than 150 years.
some contend that this flag was actually the first Stars and Stripes, first displayed on July 8, 1776.
This flag has 13 red and white stripes in the canton, 13 white stars centered in a blue field.
A flag was hastily improvised from garments by the defenders of Fort Schuyler at Rome, NY, August 3-22, 1777.
Historians believe it was the Grand Union Flag.
The Sons of Liberty had a flag of 9 red and white stripes, to signify 9 colonies, when they met in New York in 1765 to oppose the Stamp Tax.
By 1775, the flag had grown to 13 red and white stripes with a rattlesnake on it.
At Concord April 9, 1775, the minutemen from Bedford, MA, are said to have carried a flag having a silver arm with sword on red field.
At Cambridge, MA, the Sons of Liberty used a plain red flag with a green pine tree on it.
In June 1775, Washington went from Philadelphia to Boston to take command of the army, escorted to New York by the Philadelphia Light Horse Troop.
It carried a yellow flag that had an elaborate coat of arms- the shield charged with 13 knots, the motto "For These We Strive" - and a canton of 13 blue and silver stripes.
In February 1776, Col Christopher Gadsden, a member of the Continental Congress, gave the South Carolina Provincial Congress a flag "such as is to be used by the commander-in-chief of the American Navy."
It had a yellow field, with a rattlesnake about to strike and the words "Don't Tread on Me."
At the Battle of Bennington, August 16, 1777, patriots used a flag of 7 white and 6 red stripes with a blue canton extendeding down 9 stripes and showing an arch of 11 white stars over the figue 76 and a star in each of the upper corners.
The stars are 7pointed.
this flag is preserved in the Historical Museum at Bennington, VT.
At the Battle of Cowpens, January 17, 1781, the 3d Maryland Regiment is said to have carried a flag of 13 red and white stripes, with a blue canton containing 12 stars in a circle around one star.
Who Designed the Flag? No one knows for certain.
Francis Hopkinson, designer of a naval flag, declard he also had designed the flag and in 1781 asked Congress to reimburse him for his services.
Congress did not do so.
Dumas Malone of columbia University wrote: "This talented man...designed the American flag."
Who called the Flag "Old Glory"? The flag is said to have been named Old Glory by Willaim Driver, a sea captain of Salem, MA.
One ledgend has it that when he raised the flag on his brig, the Charles Doggett, in 1824, he said: "I name thee Old Glory."
But his daughter, who presented the flag to the Smithsonian Institution, said he named it as his 21st birthday celebration on March 17, 1824, when his mother presented the homemade flag to him.
The Betsy Ross Legend.
The widely publicized legend that Mrs. Betsy Ross made the first Stars and Stripes in June 1776, at the request of a committee composed of George Washington, Robert Morris, and george Ross, and uncle, was first made public in 1870, by a grandson of Mrs. Ross.
Historians have been unable to find a historical record of such a meeting or committee.
Adding New Stars The flag of 1777 was used until 1795.
Then, on the admission of Vermot and Kentucky to the Union, Congress passed and President Washington signed an act that after May 1, 1795, the flag should have 15 stripes, alternating red and white, and 15 white stars on a blue field.
When new states were admitted, it became evident that the flag would become burdened with stripes.
Congress thereupon ordered that after July 4, 1818, the flag should have 13 stripes, symbolizing the 13 orignal states; that the union have 20 stars, and that whenever a new state was admitted a new star should be added on the July 4 following admission.
No law designates the permanent arrangement of the stars.
However, since 1912, when a new state has been admitted, the new design has been announced by executive order.
No star is specifically identified with any state.
The Flag of the United States - The Stars and Stripes History is from "The World Almanac and Book of Facts 2000".

November 2001 This famous name was coined by Captain Stephen Driver, a shipmaster of Salem, Massachusetts, in 1831.
As he was leaving on one of his many voyages aboard the brig CHARLES DOGGETT - and this one would climax with the rescue of the mutineers of the BOUNTY - some friends presented him with a beautiful flag of twenty four stars.
As the banner opened to the ocean breeze for the first time, he exclaimed "Old Glory!" He retired to Nashville in 1837, taking his treasured flag from his sea days with him.
By the time the Civil War erupted, most everyone in and around Nashville recognized Captain Driver's "Old Glory."
When Tennesee seceded from the Union, Rebels were determined to destroy his flag, but repeated searches revealed no trace of the hated banner.
Then on February 25th, 1862, Union forces captured Nashville and raised the American flag over the capital.
It was a rather small ensign and immediately folks began asking Captain Driver if "Old Glory" still existed.
Happy to have soldiers with him this time, Captain Driver went home and began ripping at the seams of his bedcover.
As the stitches holding the quilt-top to the batting unraveled, the onlookers peered inside and saw the 24-starred original "Old Glory"! Captain Driver gently gathered up the flag and returned with the soldiers to the capitol.
Though he was sixty years old, the Captain climbed up to the tower to replace the smaller banner with his beloved flag.
The Sixth Ohio Regiment cheered and saluted - and later adopted the nickname "Old Glory" as their own, telling and re-telling the story of Captain Driver's devotion to the flag we honor yet today.
Captain Driver's grave is located in the old Nashville City Cemetery, and is one of three (3) places authorized by act of Congress where the Flag of the United States may be flown 24 hours a day.
I have so far been unable to determine where "Old Glory" resides today.
A caption above a faded black and white picture in the book, The Stars and the Stripes, says only that "'Old Glory' may no longer be opened to be photographed, and no color photograph is available."
Visible in the photo in the lower right corner of the canton is an appliqued anchor, Captain Driver's very personal note.
"Old Glory" is the most illustrious of a number of flags - both Northern and Confederate - reputed to have been similarly hidden, then later revealed as times changed.

Congressman Francis Hopkinson seems most likely to have designed it, and few historians believe that Betsy Ross, a Philadelphia seamstress, made the first one.
Until the Executive Order of June 24, 1912, neither the order of the stars nor the proportions of the flag was prescribed.
Consequently, flags dating before this period sometimes show unusual arrangements of the stars and odd proportions, these features being left to the discretion of the flag maker.
In general, however, straight rows of stars and proportions similar to those later adopted officially were used.
The principal acts affecting the flag of the United States are the following: q q q q q q On June 14, 1777, in order to establish an official flag for the new nation, the Continental Congress passed the first Flag Act: "Resolved, That the flag of the United States be made of thirteen stripes, alternate red and white; that the union be thirteen stars, white in a blue field, representing a new Constellation."
Act of January 13, 1794 - provided for 15 stripes and 15 stars after May 1795.
Act of April 4, 1818 - provided for 13 stripes and one star for each state, to be added to the flag on the 4th of July following the admission of each new state.
Executive Order of President Taft dated June 24, 1912 - established proportions of the flag and provided for arrangement of the stars in six horizontal rows of eight each, a single point of each star to be upward.
Executive Order of President Eisenhower dated January 3, 1959 - provided for the arrangement of the stars in seven rows of seven stars each, staggered horizontally and vertically.
Executive Order of President Eisenhower dated August 21, 1959 - provided for the arrangement of the stars in nine rows of stars staggered horizon tally and eleven rows of stars staggered vertically.

This flag is without question the most well known of those.
There are many reasons why this flag is confused with the first official U.S. flag and you can read more about Betsy Ross here.
Join or Die Flag 1754: The rattlesnake was the favorite animal emblem of the Americans even before the Revolution.
In 1751 Benjamin Franklin's Pennsylvania Gazette carried a bitter article protesting the British practice of sending convicts to America.
The author suggested tht the colonists return the favor by shipping "a cargo of rattlesnakes, which could be distributed in St. James Park, Spring Garden, and other places of pleasure, and particularly in the noblemen's gardens."
Three years later the same paper printed the picture (as seen above) of a snake as a commentary on the Albany Congress.
To remind the delegates of the danger of disunity, the serpent was shown cut to pieces.
Each segment is marked with the name of a colony, and the motto "Join or Die" below.
Other newspapers took up the snake theme.
By 1774 the segments of the snake had grown together, and the motto had been changed to read: "United Now Alive and Free Firm on this Basis Liberty Shall Stand and Thus Supported Ever Bless Our Land Till Time Becomes Eternity" Other authors felt the rattlesnake was a good example of America's virtues.
They argued that it is unique to America; individually its rattles produce no sound, but united they can be heard by all; and while it does not attack unless provoked, it is deadly to step upon one.
Washington's Flag 1775: This was the personal flag of the Commander-In-Chief during the Revolutionary War.
A reproduction of this flag flies today at Washington's Headquarters, Valley Forge.
Grand Union Flag 1775: Also known as the Continental flag, it is the first true U.S. Flag.
It combined the British King's Colours and the thirteen stripes signifying Colonial unity.
George Washington liked this design so well that he chose it to be flown to celebrate the formation of the Continental Army on New Years Day, 1776.
On that day the Grand Union Flag was proudly raised on Prospect Hill in Somerville, near his headquarters at Cambridge, Massachusetts.
The Gadsden Flag 1776: The American Revolutionary period was a time of intense but controlled individualism - when self-directing responsible individuals again and again decided for themselves what they should do, and did it- without needing anyone else to give them an assignment or supervise them in carrying it out.
Such a person was the patriot Colonel Christopher Gadsden of South Carolina.
He had seen and liked a bright yellow banner with a hissing, coiled rattlesnake rising up in the center, and beneath the serpent the same words that appeared on the Striped Rattlesnake Flag - Don't Tread On Me.
Colonel Gadsden made a copy of this flag and submitted the design to the Provincial Congress in South Carolina.
Commodore Esek Hopkins, commander of the new Continental fleet, carried a similar flag in February, 1776, when his ships put to sea for the first time.
Hopkins captured large stores of British cannon and military supplies in the Bahamas.
His cruise marked the salt-water baptism of the American Navy, and it saw the first landing of the Corps of Marines, on whose drums the Gadsden symbol was painted.
The Culpepper Flag 1776: One of the first flags flown by our Navy may have been an adaptation of the "Rebellious Stripes" created at the time of the Stamp Act Congress.
It featured thirteen red and white stripes.
Stretched across them was the rippling form of a rattlesnake, and the words, "DON'T TREAD ON ME"- a striking indication of the colonists' courage and fierce desire for independence.
The flag we know today as the first Navy Jack (sometimes known as the "Culpepper Flag) is believed to have flown aboard the Alfred, flagship of the newly commissioned Continental fleet, in January, 1776.
American ships used this flag, or one of its variations, throughout the Revolutionary War.
The Bennington Flag 1777: Used in the Battle of Bennington, August 16, 1777, by Vermont militia.
This flag is the first to lead American armed forces on land.
The original is preserved in the museum at Bennington, Vermont.
The 13 Star Flag 1777: The First Official United States Flag: This 13-Star Flag became the Official United States Flag on June14th, 1777 and is the result of the congressional action that took place on that date.
Much evidence exists pointing to Congressman Francis Hopkinson as the person responsible for its design.The only President to serve under this flag was George Washington (1789-1797).
This Flag was the official flag for a period of 18 years.
Each star and stripe represented a Colony of which there were thirteen, united nearly one year earlier by the Declaration of Independence.
The thirteen Colonies are listed below with the date that each ratified the Constitution and became a State.
q q q q q q q q q q q q q (1st) Delaware - December 7, 1787 (2nd) Pennsylvania - December 12,1787 (3rd) New Jersey - December 18, 1787 (4th) Georgia - January 2, 1788 (5th) Connecticut - January 9, 1788 (6th) Massachusetts - February 6, 1788 (7th) Maryland - April 28, 1788 (8th) South Carolina - May 23, 1788 (9th) New Hampshire - June 21, 1788 (10th) Virginia - June 25, 1788 (11th) New York - July 25, 1788 (12th) North Carolina - November 21, 1789 (13th) Rhode Island - May 29, 1790 The Serapis Flag 1779: Designed with 13 stripes alternating red, white and blue.
This flag was raised by Captain John Paul Jones on the British frigate Serapis during the most famous Revolutionary naval battle.
He was born John Paul in Scotland in 1747 and went to sea when he was only twelve years old.
By the time he arrived in Philadelphia in 1775 as an experienced sea captain, he had changed his name to John Paul Jones.
After conducting sea raids on the coast of Britain, he took command in 1779 of a rebuilt French merchant ship, renamed the U.S.S. Bonhomme Richard to honor Benjamin Franklin.
On September 23, 1779, Jones engaged the British frigate Serapis in the North Sea, daringly sailing in close, lashing his vessel to the British ship, and fighting the battle at point-blank range.
During the fight two of his cannon burst, and the British captain asked Jones if he was ready to surrender.
Replied Jones: "Sir, I have not yet begun to fight."
The American crew finally boarded the Serapis after the British had struck her colors, and from the deck of the Serapis they watched the U.S.S.Bonhomme Richard sink into the North Sea.
The Guilford Flag 1781: This unusual flag was made with thirteen 8-pointed stars in a wide field.
Historical records report this flag carried by North Carolina militiamen at the Battle of Guilford Courthouse, March 17,1781.
The Star Spangled Banner, the 15 Star Flag 1795: This Flag became the Official United States Flag on May 1, 1795.
Two stars were added for the admission of q q (14th) Vermont - March 4, 1791 (15th) Kentucky - June 1, 1792 This was the official flag for 23 years.
The five Presidents who served under this flag were; George Washington (1789-1797), John Adams (1797-1801), Thomas Jefferson (1801-1809), James Madison (1809-1817), and James Monroe (1817-1825).
The 15-star, 15-stripe flag was authorized by the Flag Act of January 13, 1794, adding 2 stripes and 2 Stars.
The regulation went into effect on May 1, 1795.
This flag was the only U.S. Flag to have more than 13 stripes.
It was immortalized by Francis Scott Key during the bombardment of Fort McHenry, Sept 13, 1814.
The image above is representative of the actual flag that flew over Fort McHenry on that day and which is now preserved in the Smithsonian Museum.
You can notice the "tilt" in some of the stars just as in the original Star Spangled Banner.
Where the original Star Spangled Banner went... 1814 1818 1824 1860's June 24, 1873 1876 1912 1914 The battle occurred, and the flag won its glory.
Armistead was promoted to Lt. Colonel by Madison, and given the flag when he retired.
Armistead died, and legend says that the flag was used in his funeral.
Afterwards, his daughter Georgiana Armistead retained possession of the flag.
The flag was used in a reception for General Lafayette.
Sometime afterwards, Georgiana gave the flag to her son, Even Appleton.
The flag, ironically, was sent to England for safe keeping during the Civil War.
The flag was displayed in the Charleston Naval Yards, and one of the first photographs was taken of it.
The flag was loaned to the Smithsonian for the Centenial Celebration.
Even Appleton donated the flag to the Smithsonian.
Almari Flowler was commissioned to replace the original "sack cloth" backing with linen.
The 20 Star Flag 1818: Realizing that the addition of a new star and new stripe for each new State was impractical, Congress passed the Flag Act of 1818 which returned the flag design to 13 stripes and specified 20 stars for the 20 states.
This Flag became the Official United States Flag on April 13th, 1818.

She kept the upholstery shop going and lived on Arch Street, not too far from the State House on Chestnut, where history was being made almost every day.
According to most historians, she has been incorrectly credited with designing the first Stars and Stripes.
The story has enormous popularity, yet the facts do not substantiate it.
Lets begin with the legend itself.
George Washington was a frequent visitor to the home of Mrs. Ross before receiving command of the army.
She embroidered his shirt ruffles and did many other things for him.
He knew her skill with a needle.
Now the General of the Continental Army, George Washington appeared on Mrs. Ross's dooorstep around the first of June, 1776, with two representatives of Congress, Colonel Ross and Robert Morris.
They asked that she make a flag according to a rough drawing they carried with them.
At Mrs.Ross's suggestion, Washington redrew the flag design in pencil in her back parlor to employ stars of five points instead of six.
("Her version" of the flag for the new republic was not used until six years later.)
This account of the creation of our first flag was first brought to light in 1870 by one of her grandsons, William J. Canby, at a meeting of the Historical Society of Pennsylvania.
This took place 94 years after the event supposedly took place! Mr. Canby was a boy of eleven years when Mrs. Ross died in his home.
In the many years since the story was told, numerous historians have conducted vigorous searches into extant government records, personal diaries,and writings of Washington and his contemporaries and none of them have been able to verify the claims of Canby.
One verifiable fact is this; the minutes of the State Navy Board of Pennsylvania for May 29, 1777, say in part "An order on William Webb to Elizabeth Ross for fourteen pounds twelve shillings, and two pence, for making ship's colours,
The minutes show that Elizabeth Ross made ship's colors for Pennsylvania state ships.
Some of the facts, among others, that have been discovered by this research that cast doubt on Canby's claim are these; He asserted that the stars and stripes were in common if not general use soon after the signing of the Declaration of Independence, nearly a year before the resolution of Congress proclaiming the flag.
There is no record of the flag being discussed or of a committee being appointed for the design of the flag in either the Journals of the Continental Congress or the diaries and writings of Washington around this time.
Meetings with Colonel Ross and Robert Morris cannot be documented.
Further, it is illogical to assume that Washington was present at the alleged meeting with Betsy Ross on the design of the flag when it is known that he wanted a national standard made for the use of the army in 1779.
But I think that the question that begs to be asked is; Why have so many generations of Americans come to accept this legend as fact? After Canby's death, a book written by his brother George Canby and nephew Lloyd Balderson was published in 1909.
The book, The Evolution of the American Flag, presented in more detail the claims for Betsy Ross made by William Canby in 1870.
Among other things, the authors describe the formation of the Betsy Ross Memorial Association, and reproduced a painting by Charles H. Weisgerber depicting the alleged meeting of the committee of Congress with Betsy Ross.
The picture, entitled Birth of Our Nations Flag, is actually a composite portrait made up of from pictures of her granddaughters and other decendants.
The artist took liberties with history by painting the stars in the flag in a circle.
This painting, incidently, stirred a great deal of public interest in the subject when it was first exibited, at the Columbian Exposition in Chicago in 1893.
Following this, money to purchase the Betsy Ross house in Philadelphia was raised by selling ten-cent subscriptions to the American Flag House and Betsy Ross Memorial Association, incorporated in 1898.
Each contributor received a certificate of membership that included a picture of the house, her grave in Mt. Moriah Cemetery in Philadelphia, and a color reproduction of the Weisberger painting.
This campaign gave the legend wide publicity and the Weisberger painting was reproduced in school history textbooks thoughout the United States! In the days of Betsy Ross we did not have the benefit of a frenetic press corps to witness, probe, and record the events of the day.
Careful historians do not accept the legend and neither should we.
At the same time, there often seems to be a wistful regret, best expressed, perhaps, by President Woodrow Wilson when asked his opinion of the story.
He replied, "Would that it were true!"

He almost certainly was the person who designed the first Stars and Stripes.
He was appointed to the Continental Navy Board on November 6,1776.
It was while serving on the Continental Navy Board that he turned his attention to designing the flag of the United States.
The use of stars in that design is believed to have been the result of an experience in the war directly related to his prioperty.
A book in Hopkinsons library at his home in Bordentown was taken by a Hessian soldier in December 1776, a dark year of the war.
The book, Discourses on Public Occasions in America (London, 1762) by William Smith,D.D., had been a gift to him by the author.
The soldier, one I. Ewald, wrote on the inside cover that he had seen the author near Philadelphia and that he, Ewald, had taken the book from a fine country seat near Philadelphia.
The book was subsequently given to someone in Philadelphia who returned it to Hopkinson.
The soldier had written above and below Hopkinson's bookplate, which had three six pointed stars and his family motto, "Semper Paratus", or "Always Ready".
The safe return of the book may well have symbolized to Hopkinson the revival of the Americans hope.
In a letter to the Board of Admiralty in 1780 Hopkinson asserted that he had designed "the flag of as well as several ornaments, devices, and checks appearing on bills of exchange, ship papers, the Admiralty and Treasury, and the Great Seal of the United States.
Hopkinson had received nothing submitted a bill and asked "whether a Quarter Cask of the public wine" would not be a reasonable labors.
the United States of America" seals of the boards of for this work, and now he and proper reward for his The Board forwarded the letter to Congress, which referred it to the Board of Treasury.
Apparently acting on a request from Congress, Hopkinson sent a detailed bill on June 6th, and it was sent to the auditor general, James Milligan.
He sent it to the commissioners of the Chamber of Accounts, who replied six days later on June 12th that they were of the opinion that the charges were reasonable and ought to be paid.
Milligan gave the report a favorable endorsement and passed it on to the Board of Treasury.
The board now raised objections and returned the bill to the auditor general on the grounds that no vouchers were included with the bill.
Hopkinson now submitted a new copy of his bill and itemized each charge and it was rejected once again, and the auditor asked once more for its favorable consideration.
After another round of referal through the departments, the board filed the correspondence and did nothing for two and half months.
Fed up with the delay, Hopkinson wrote to Charles Lee, the secretary of the Board of Treasury, accusing him of lying about having received the amended bill and delaying the settlement of his claim.
Lee failed to satisfy Hopkinson, and the latter sent to Congress a list of charges against the board.
Just as in our modern times, Congress appointed a committee to investigate the matter.
The various government officers concerned with the claim appeared before the committee at its request.
Only the men of the Board of Treasury ignored the summons.
In its report to Congress, the committee recommended that the present board be dismissed.
Congress sent the report back to the committee for further consideration and another investigation and another report followed.
In its second report the committee noted that this time the members of the Board of Treasury answered the summons, but frequently tried to dictate the way in which the investigation should be made.
The committee felt that the Treasury should be directed by a single individual responsible to Congress, but made no recommendation in regard to Hopkinson's claim.
The matter remained unsettled until August 23rd,1781, when Congress passed a resolution asking that the claim be acted on.
Meanwhile, Hopkinson had grown weary of the controversy and on July 23rd, 1781, he resigned his office as Treasurer of Loans.
One of Hopkinsons chief opponents on the board of Treasury resigned the same day.
Between the first and second report of the committee the Board of Treasury gave its own report to Congress on the history of the Hopkinson claim.
Aside from the lack of vouchers, the members of the board knew that "Hopkinson was not the only person consulted" on the matter of designs and therefore could not rightly claim the whole amount, and in addition, the board felt that the public was entitled to these extra services from men who drew high salaries.
Though Hopkinson's political adversaries blocked all attempts to have him paid for his services, they never denied that he made the designs.
The journals of the Continental Congress clearly show that he designed the flag.
The design of the first Stars and Stripes by Hopkinson had the thirteen stars arranged in a "staggered" pattern technically known as quincuncial because it is based on the repetition of a motif of five units.
This arrangment inevitably results in a strongly diagonal effect.
In a flag of thirteen stars, this placement produced the unmistakable outline of the crosses of St. George and of St. Andrew, as used together on the British flag.
Whether this similarity was intentional or accidental, it may explain why the plainer fashion of placing the stars in three paralell rows was preferred by many Americans over the quincuncial style.

He made his home there from 1804 to around 1833 with his wife Mary and their six sons and five daughters.
At the time, Georgetown was a thriving town of 5,000 people just a few miles from the Capitol, the White House, and the Federal buildings of Washington.
But, after war broke out in 1812 over Britian's attempts to regulate American shipping and other activities while Britain was at war with France, all was not tranquil in Georgetown.
The British had entered Chesapeake Bay on August 19th, 1814, and by the evening of the 24th of August, the British had invaded and captured Washington.
They set fire to the Capitol and the White House, the flames visible 40 miles away in Baltimore.
President James Madison,his wife Dolley, and his Cabinet had already fled to a safer location.
Such was their haste to leave that they had had to rip the Stuart portrait of George Washington from the walls without its frame! A thunderstorm at dawn kept the fires from spreading.
The next day more buildings were burned and again a thunderstorm dampened the fires.
Having done their work the British troops returned to their ships in and around the Chesapeake Bay.
In the days following the attack on Washington, the American forces prepared for the assault on Baltimore (population 40,000) that they knew would come by both land and sea.
Word soon reached Francis Scott Key that the British had carried off an elderly and much loved town physician of Upper Marlboro, Dr. William Beanes, and was being held on the British flagship TONNANT.
The townsfolk feared that Dr. Beanes would be hanged.
They asked Francis Scott Key for his help, and he agreed, and arranged to have Col. John Skinner, an American agent for prisoner exchange to accompany him.
On the morning of September 3rd, he and Col. Skinner set sail from Baltimore aboard a sloop flying a flag of truce approved by President Madison.
On the 7th they found and boarded the TONNANT to confer with Gen. Ross and Adm. Alexander Cochrane.
At first they refused to release Dr. Beanes.
But Key and Skinner produced a pouch of letters written by wounded British prisoners praising the care they were receiving from the Americans, among them Dr. Beanes.
The British officers relented but would not release the three Americans immediately because they had seen and heard too much of the preparations for the attack on Baltimore.
They were placed under guard, first aboard the H.M.S. Surprise, then onto the sloop and forced to wait out the battle behind the British fleet.
Now let's go back to the summer of 1813 for a moment.
At the star-shaped Fort McHenry, the commander, Maj. George Armistead, asked for a flag so big that "the British would have no trouble seeing it from a distance".
Two officers, a Commodore and a General, were sent to the Baltimore home of Mary Young Pickersgill, a "maker of colours," and commisioned the flag.
Mary and her thirteen year old daughter Caroline, working in an upstairs front bedroom, used 400 yards of best quality wool bunting.
They cut 15 stars that measured two feet from point to point.
Eight red and seven white stripes, each two feet wide, were cut.
Laying out the material on the malthouse floor of Claggett's Brewery, a neighborhood establishment, the flag was sewn together.
By August it was finished.
It measured 30 by 42 feet and cost $405.90.
The Baltimore Flag House, a museum, now occupies her premises, which were restored in 1953.
At 7 a.m. on the morning of September 13, 1814, the British bombardment began, and the flag was ready to meet the enemy.
The bombardment continued for 25 hours,the British firing 1,500 bombshells that weighed as much as 220 pounds and carried lighted fuses that would supposedly cause it to explode when it reached its target.
But they weren't very dependable and often blew up in mid air.
From special small boats the British fired the new Congreve rockets that traced wobbly arcs of red flame across the sky.
The Americans had sunk 22 vessels so a close approach by the British was not possible.
That evening the connonading stopped, but at about 1 a.m. on the 14th, the British fleet roared to life, lighting the rainy night sky with grotesque fireworks.
Key, Col. Skinner, and Dr. Beanes watched the battle with apprehension.
They knew that as long as the shelling continued, Fort McHenry had not surrendered.
But, long before daylight there came a sudden and mysterious silence.
What the three Americans did not know was that the British land assault on Baltimore as well as the naval attack, had been abandoned.
Judging Baltimore as being too costly a prize, the British officers ordered a retreat.
Waiting in the predawn darkness, Key waited for the sight that would end his anxiety; the joyous sight of Gen. Armisteads great flag blowing in the breeze.
When at last daylight came, the flag was still there! Being an amatuer poet and having been so uniquely inspired, Key began to write on the back of a letter he had in his pocket.
Sailing back to Baltimore he composed more lines and in his lodgings at the Indian Queen Hotel he finished the poem.
Judge J. H. Nicholson, his brother-in-law, took it to a printer and copies were circulated around Baltimore under the title "Defence of Fort M'Henry".
Two of these copies survive.
It was printed in a newspaper for the first time in the Baltimore Patriot on September 20th,1814, then in papers as far away as Georgia and New Hampshire.
To the verses was added a note"Tune: Anacreon in Heaven."
In October a Baltimore actor sang Key's new song in a public performance and called it "The StarSpangled Banner".
Immediately popular, it remained just one of several patriotic airs until it was finally adopted as our national anthem on March 3, 1931.
But the actual words were not included in the legal documents.
Key himself had written several versions with slight variations so discrepancies in the exact wording still occur.
The flag, our beloved Star-Spangled Banner, went on view ,for the first time after flying over Fort McHenry, on January 1st,1876 at the Old State House in Philadelphia for the nations' Centennial celebration.
It now resides in the Smithsonian Institution's Museum of American History.
An opaque curtain shields the now fragile flag from light and dust.
The flag is exposed for viewing for a few moments once every hour during museum hours.
Francis Scott Key was a witness to the last enemy fire to fall on Fort McHenry.
The Fort was designed by a Frenchman named Jean Foncin and was named for then Secretary of war James McHenry.
Fort McHenry holds the unique designation of national monument and historic shrine.
Since May 30th, 1949 the flag has flown continuously, by a Joint Resolution of Congress, over the monument marking the site of Francis Scott Key's birthplace, Terra Rubra Farm, Carroll County, Keymar, Maryland.
The copy that Key wrote in his hotel September 14,1814, remained in the Nicholson family for 93 years.
In 1907 it was sold to Henry Walters of Baltimore.
In 1934 it was bought at auction in New York from the Walters estate by the Walters Art Gallery, Baltimore for $26,400.
The Walters Gallery in 1953 sold the manuscript to the Maryland Historical Society for the same price.
Another copy that Key made is in the Library of Congress.

The practice is erroneous, as are statements on this subject attributed to George Washington and other founders of the country.
Charles Thomson, Secretary of the Continental Congress, reporting to Congress on the Seal of the United States, stated: "The colours of the pales [the vertical stripes] are those used in the flag of the United States of America; White signifies purity and innocence, Red, hardiness 
Also this from a book about the flag published in 1977 by the House of Representatives...
"The star is a symbol of the heavens and the divine goal to which man has aspired from time immemorial; the stripe is symbolic of the rays of light emanating from the sun."
The quote below is from a book "So Proudly We Hail, The History of the United States Flag" Smithsonian Institute Press 1981, by Wiliam R. Furlong and Byron McCandless.
"The placing of a fringe on Our Flag is optional with the person of organization, and no Act of Congress or Executive Order either prohibits the practice, according to the Institute of Hearaldry.
Fringe is used on indoor flags only, as fringe on flags on outdoor flags would deteriorate rapidly.
The fringe on a Flag is considered and 'honorable enrichment only', and its official use by the US Army dates from 1895..
A 1925 Attorney General's Opinion states: 'the fringe does not appear to be regarded as an integral part of the Flag, and its presence cannot be said to constitute an unauthorized addition to the design prescribed by statute.
An external fringe is to be distinguished from letters, words, or emblematic designs printed or superimposed upon the body of the flag itself.
Under law, such additions might be open to objection as unauthorized; but the same is not necessarily true of the fringe.'"
The gold trim is generally used on ceremonial indoor flags that are used for special services and is believed to have been first used in a military setting.
It has no specific significance that I have ever run across, and its (gold trim) use is in compliance with applicable flag codes and laws.
Pantone Colors for the U.S. Flag The U.S. Government Printing Office specifies Pantone 186 and 288 for the red and blue colors of the United States flag, but Pantone specifies Pantone 193 and 281.
Other sources specify Pantone 282 for blue.
This may be because inks look different on different paper stocks.

Special care should be taken that no part of the flag touches the ground.
The Flag is then carefully folded into the shape of a tri-cornered hat, emblematic of the hats worn by colonial soldiers during the war for Independence.
In the folding, the red and white stripes are finally wrapped into the blue, as the light of day vanishes into the darkness of night.
This custom of special folding is reserved for the United States Flag alone.
How to fold the Flag Step 1 To properly fold the U.S. Flag, begin by holding it waist-high with another person so that its surface is parallel to the ground.
Step 2 Fold the lower half of the stripe section lengthwise over the field of stars, holding the bottom and top edges securely.
Step 3 Fold the flag again lengthwise with the blue field on the outside.
Step 4 Make a triangular fold by bringing the striped corner of the folded edge to meet the open (top) edge of the flag.
Step 5 Turn the outer (end) point inward, parallel to the open edge, to form a second triangle.
Step 6 The triangular folding is continued until the entire length of the flag is folded in this manner.
Step 7 When the flag is completely folded, only a triangular blue field of stars should be visible.

Here is a typical sequence of the reading: (Begin reading as Honor Guard or Flag Detail is coming forward).
The flag folding ceremony represents the same religious principles on which our country was originally founded.
The portion of the flag denoting honor is the canton of blue containing the stars representing the states our veterans served in uniform.
The canton field of blue dresses from left to right and is inverted when draped as a pall on a casket of a veteran who has served our country in uniform.
In the Armed Forces of the United States, at the ceremony of retreat the flag is lowered, folded in a triangle fold and kept under watch throughout the night as a tribute to our nation's honored dead.
The next morning it is brought out and, at the ceremony of reveille, run aloft as a symbol of our belief in the resurrection of the body.
(Wait for the Honor Guard or Flag Detail to unravel and fold the flag into a quarter fold--resume reading when Honor Guard is standing ready.)
The first fold of our flag is a symbol of life.
The second fold is a symbol of our belief in the eternal life.
The third fold is made in honor and remembrance of the veteran departing our ranks who gave a portion of life for the defense of our country to attain a peace throughout the world.
The fourth fold represents our weaker nature, for as American citizens trusting in God, it is to Him we turn in times of peace as well as in times of war for His divine guidance.
The fifth fold is a tribute to our country, for in the words of Stephen Decatur, "Our country, in dealing with other countries, may she always be right; but it is still our country, right or wrong."
The sixth fold is for where our hearts lie.
It is with our heart that we pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States of America, and to the republic for which it stands, one nation, under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all.
The seventh fold is a tribute to our Armed Forces, for it is through the Armed Forces that we protect our country and our flag against all her enemies, whether they be found within or without the boundaries of our republic.
The eighth fold is a tribute to the one who entered in to the valley of the shadow of death, that we might see the light of day, and to honor mother, for whom it flies on mother's day.
The ninth fold is a tribute to womanhood; for it has been through their faith, love, loyalty and devotion that the character of the men and women who have made this country great have been molded.
The tenth fold is a tribute to father, for he, too, has given his sons and daughters for the defense of our country since they were first born.
The eleventh fold, in the eyes of a Hebrew citizen, represents the lower portion of the seal of King David and King Solomon, and glorifies, in their eyes, the God of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob.
The twelfth fold, in the eyes of a Christian citizen, represents an emblem of eternity and glorifies, in their eyes, God the Father, the Son, and Holy Ghost.
When the flag is completely folded, the stars are uppermost, reminding us of our national motto, "In God we Trust."
(Wait for the Honor Guard or Flag Detail to inspect the flag--after the inspection, resume reading.)
After the flag is completely folded and tucked in, it takes on the appearance of a cocked hat, ever reminding us of the soldiers who served under General George Washington and the sailors and marines who served under Captain John Paul Jones who were followed by their comrades and shipmates in the Armed Forces of the United States, preserving for us the rights, privileges, and freedoms we enjoy today.

This article remains the copyrighted material of the National Flag Foundation and is presented here by permission.
Flying the flag at half-staff is an area of flag etiquette that most people want to make sure they get right.
It is also an area for which the road to error is routinely paved with good intentions.
With that in mind, we offer this refresher course as the allimportant intersection where knowledge meets benevolence.
FLYING THE FLAG AT HALF-STAFF:
The pertinent section of the Flag Code says, "by order of the President, the flag shall be flown at half-staff upon the death of principal figures of the United States Government and the Governor of a State, territory, or possesion, as a mark of respect to their memory.
In the event of the death of other officials or foreign dignitaries, the flag is to be displayed at half-staff according to Presidential orders, or in accordance with recognized customs or practices not inconsistent with law.
In the event of the death a present or former official of the government of any State, territory, or possession of the United States, the Governor of that state, territory, or possession may proclaim that the National flag shall be flown at half-staff."
The code also includes other related details including the specific length of time during which the flag should be displayed at half-staff, in the event of the death of a "principal figure"(e.g., 30 days for the death of a sitting or former President, 10 days for the death of a sitting Vice-President,etc.).
GOOD-FAITH MISUNDERSTANDINGS: Although the code is actually pretty clear, confusion continues to occur.
For example, U.S. Attorney General Janet Reno recently ordered the American Flag flown at half-staff on all U.S. Department of Justice buildings, in honor of several DEA agents who had died.
While NFF understands this gesture, the Flag Code does not give Attorney General Reno the authority to issue that order.
Closer to NFF's Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania home, Mayor Tom Murphy ordered all flags flown at half-staff to honor the victims of a plane crash.
Here again, a well-intentioned gesture, but one for which no authority exists.
NFF points out these "good-faith misunderstandings" not to criticize or embarrass anyone, but rather to head off a growing trivialization of this memorial salute, and to preserve the dignity and significance of flying the U.S. flag at half-staff.
To any readers who may think that NFF is insensitive for raising these breaches of etiquette, please be assured that our motives are pure.
We grieve these human loses deeply; however, we believe proper respect for our flag must be maintained - no matter the circumstances.
We owe that respect to our living, our dead and our flag.

BJ Cigrand, a schoolteacher, arranged for the pupils in the Fredonia, Wisconsin Public School, District 6, to observe June 14 (the 108th anniversary of the official adoption of The Stars and Stripes) as 'Flag Birthday'.
In numerous magazines and newspaper articles and public addresses over the following years, Cigrand continued to enthusiastically advocate the observance of June 14 as 'Flag Birthday', or 'Flag Day'.
On June 14, 1889, George Balch, a kindergarten teacher in New York City, planned appropriate ceremonies for the children of his school, and his idea of observing Flag Day was later adopted by the State Board of Education of New York.
On June 14, 1891, the Betsy Ross House in Philadelphia held a Flag Day celebration, and on June 14 of the following year, the New York Society of the Sons of the Revolution, celebrated Flag Day.
Following the suggestion of Colonel J Granville Leach (at the time historian of the Revolution), the Pennsylvania Society of Colonial Dames of America on April 25, mayor of Philadelphia and all others in authority and all private citizens to display recommend that thereafter the day be known as 'Flag Day', and on that day, school exercises, with each child being given a small Flag.
Two weeks later on May 8th, the Board of Managers of the Pennsylvania endorsed the action of the Pennsylvania Society of Colonial Dames.
As a Superintendent of Public Schools of Philadelphia, directed that Flag Day Square.
School children were assembled, each carrying a small Flag, and Pennsylvania Society of the Sons of the 1893 adopted a resolution requesting the the Flag on June 14th.
Leach went on to children be assembled for appropriate Society of Sons of the Revolution unanimously result of the resolution, Dr. Edward Brooks, then exercises be held on June 14, 1893 in Independence patriotic songs were sung and addresses delivered.
In 1894, the governor of New York directed that on June 14 the Flag be displayed on all public buildings.
With BJ Cigrand and Leroy Van Horn as the moving spirits, the Illinois organization, known as the American Flag Day Association, was organized for the purpose of promoting the holding of Flag Day exercises.
On June 14th, 1894, under the auspices of this association, the first general public school children's celebration of Flag Day in Chicago was held in Douglas, Garfield, Humboldt, Lincoln, and Washington Parks, with more than 300,000 children participating.
Adults, too, participated in patriotic programs.
Franklin K. Lane, Secretary if the Interior, delivered a 1914 Flag Day address in which he repeated words he said the flag had spoken to him that morning: "I am what you make me; nothing more.
I swing before your eyes as a bright gleam of color, a symbol of yourself."
Inspired by these three decades of state and local celebrations, Flag Day - the anniversary of the Flag Resolution of 1777 - was officially established by the Proclamation of President Woodrow Wilson on May 30th, 1916.
While Flag Day was celebrated in various communities for years after Wilson's proclamation, it was not until August 3rd, 1949, that President Truman signed an Act of Congress designating June 14th of each year as National Flag Day.

Whose broad stripes and bright stars, thro' the perilous fight' O'er the ramparts we watched, were so gallantly streaming.
And the rockets red glare, the bombs bursting in air, Gave proof through the night that our flag was still there.
Oh, say, does that star-spangled banner yet wave O'er the land of the free and the home of the brave? On the shore dimly seen, thro' the mists of the deep, Where the foe's haughty host in dread silence reposes, What is that which the breeze, o'er the towering steep, As it fitfully blows, half conceals, half discloses? Now it catches the gleam of the morning's first beam, In full glory reflected, now shines on the stream; 'Tis the star-spangled banner: oh, long may it wave O'er the land of the free and the home of the brave.
And where is that band who so vauntingly swore That the havoc of war and the battle's confusion A home and a country should leave us no more? Their blood has wash'd out their foul footstep's pollution.
No refuge could save the hireling and slave From the terror of flight or the gloom of the grave, And the star-spangled banner in triumph doth wave O'er the land of the free and the home of the brave.
Oh, thus be it ever when free men shall stand, Between their loved homes and the war's desolation; Blest with vict'ry and peace, may the heav'n-rescued land Praise the Power that has made and preserved us as a nation.
Then conquer we must, when our cause is just, And this be our motto: "In God is our trust"; And the star-spangled banner in triumph shall wave O'er the land of the free and the home of the brave.

On September 8,1892, the Boston based "The Youth's Companion" magazine published a few words for students to repeat on Columbus Day that year.
Written by Francis Bellamy,the circulation manager and native of Rome, New York, and reprinted on thousands of leaflets, was sent out to public schools across the country.
On October 12, 1892, the quadricentennial of Columbus' arrival, more than 12 million children recited the Pledge of Allegiance, thus beginning a required school-day ritual.
At the first National Flag Conference in Washington D.C., on June14, 1923, a change was made.
For clarity, the words "the Flag of the United States" replaced "my flag".
In the following years various other changes were suggested but were never formally adopted.
It was not until 1942 that Congress officially recognized the Pledge of Allegiance.
One year later, in June 1943, the Supreme Court ruled that school children could not be forced to recite it.
In fact,today only half of our fifty states have laws that encourage the recitation of the Pledge of Allegiance in the classroom! In June of 1954 an amendment was made to add the words "under God".
Then-President Dwight D. Eisenhower said "In this way we are reaffirming the transcendence of reigious faith in America's heritage and future; in this way we shall constantly strengthen those spiritual weapons which forever will be our country's most powerful resource in peace and war."

Some additional information, paraphrased from other sources, is included here.
The bald eagle is truly an all-American bird -- it is the only eagle unique to North America.
It ranges over most of the continent, from the northern reaches of Alaska and Canada down to northern Mexico.
The bald eagle, our national symbol, is listed as endangered under the Endangered Species Act in 43 of the lower 48 states and listed as threatened in Michigan, Minnesota, Oregon, Washington, and Wisconsin.
(There are about 40,000 bald eagles in Alaska and none in Hawaii.)
However, bald eagles have improved greatly in numbers, productivity, and security in recent years.
Male bald eagles generally measure 3 feet from head to tail, weigh 7 to 10 pounds, and have a wingspan of about 6 1/2 feet.
Females are larger, some reaching 14 pounds and having a wingspan of up to 8 feet.
This striking raptor has large, pale eyes; a powerful yellow beak; and great, black talons.
The distinctive white head and tail feathers appear only after the bird is 4 to 5 years old.
Bald eagles are believed to live 30 years or longer in the wild, and even longer in captivity.
They mate for life and build huge nests in the tops of large trees near rivers, lakes, marshes, or other wetland areas.
Nests are often reused year after year.
With additions to the nests made annually, some may reach 10 feet across and weigh as much as 2,000 pounds.
Although bald eagles may range over great distances, they usually return to nest within 100 miles of where they were raised.
Bald eagles normally lay two to three eggs once a year and the eggs hatch after about 35 days.
The young eagles are flying within 3 months and are on their own about a month later.
However, disease, lack of food, bad weather, or human interference can kill many eaglets; sometimes only about half will survive their first year.
The staple of most bald eagle diets is fish, but they will feed on almost anything they can catch, including ducks, rodents, snakes, and carrion.
In winter, northern birds migrate south and gather in large numbers near open water areas where fish or other prey are plentiful.
Wildlife experts believe there may have been 25,000 to as many as 75,000 nesting bald eagles in the lower 48 states when the bird was adopted as our national symbol in 1782.
Since that time, the bald eagle has suffered from habitat destruction and degradation, illegal shooting, and contamination of its food source, most notably due to the pesticide DDT.
By the early 1960s there were fewer than 450 bald eagle nesting pairs in the lower 48 states.
Bald eagles have few natural enemies.
But in general they need an environment of quiet isolation; tall, mature trees; and clean waters.
Those conditions have changed over much of the bald eagle's former habitat.
History notes many wilderness areas were cleared for farms and towns, and virgin forests were cut for timber and fuel.
And, today, an increasing number of people flock to the nation's waterways for recreation, with growing impacts on bald eagle habitat.
Meanwhile, these birds of prey became prey themselves.
Although primarily fish and carrion eaters, bald eagles and other raptors were seen as marauders that killed chickens, lambs, and other domestic livestock.
As a consequence, large numbers were shot by farmers, ranchers, and others.
In 1940, noting that the national bird was "threatened with extinction," Congress passed the Bald Eagle Protection Act which made it illegal to kill, harass, possess (without a permit), or sell bald eagles.
In 1967, bald eagles were officially declared an endangered species (under a law that preceded the Endangered Species Act of 1973) in all areas of the United States south of the 40th parallel.
Federal and state government agencies, along with private organizations, successfully sought to alert the public about the bald eagle's plight and to protect its habitat from further destruction.
The greatest threat to the bald eagle's existence arose from the widespread use of DDT and other pesticides after World War II.
DDT was sprayed on croplands throughout the country and its residues washed into lakes and streams.
There, they were absorbed by aquatic plants and small animals that were eaten by fish.
The contaminated fish, in turn, were consumed by bald eagles.
The chemical interfered with the bald eagle's ability to develop strong shells for its eggs.
As a result, bald eagles and many other bird species began laying eggs with shells so thin they often broke during incubation or otherwise failed to hatch.
Their reproduction disrupted, bald eagle populations plummeted.
As the dangers of DDT became known, in large part due to Rachel Carson's famous book Silent Spring, this chemical was banned for most uses in the United States in 1972.
In addition to the adverse effects of DDT, bald eagles also died from lead poisoning as a result of feeding on hunter-killed or crippled waterfowl containing lead shot and from lead shot that was inadvertently ingested by the waterfowl.
(In 1991, a 5- year program to phase out the use of lead shot for waterfowl hunting was completed by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service.)
Gradually, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service assembled the largest colony of breeding bald eagles in captivity at its Patuxent Wildlife Research Center near Laurel, Maryland, in a major effort to return healthy eagles to the wild (the center is now run by the National Biological Survey).
Patuxent's scientists enhanced the species' breeding potential by removing the bald eagle's first clutch of eggs and incubating them artificially.
The bald eagles would usually then lay a second clutch, which the birds were allowed to incubate themselves.
In all, 124 bald eagles were hatched at Patuxent.
These captive-hatched bald eagles were an important source for restocking wild populations in certain areas of the country and helped to reestablish a broader distribution.
Patuxent's program came to an end in 1988, as bald eagles began to reproduce more successfully in the wild, and the center turned its efforts toward other more critically endangered species.
Some states continue reintroduction efforts, and two methods are generally used.
Eaglets used for reintroduction may be captivehatched or, since usually only two young per nest survive, they may be transferred from a bald eagle nest with a clutch of more than two.
These "extra" eaglets are placed in the nest of an adult pair whose own eggs are infertile or fail to hatch.
The "foster parents" readily adopt the chicks and raise them as their own.
Another method, called hacking, is a procedure adapted from the sport of falconry.
At 8 weeks of age, nestling eaglets are placed on manmade towers located in remote areas where bald eagle populations are low or non-existent.
The eaglets are kept in an enclosure and fed by humans who stay out of sight.
When the birds are capable of flight, at about 12 weeks old, the enclosure around the artificial nest is opened and the birds are free to leave.
Food is still provided at the release site until the birds learn to fend for themselves in the wild.
With these and other recovery methods, as well as habitat improvement and the banning of DDT, the bald eagle has made a remarkable comeback.
From fewer than 450 nesting pairs in the early 1960s, there are now more than 4,000 adult bald eagles nesting pairs and an unknown number of young and subadults in the conterminous United States.
This represents a substantial breeding population.
In the last few years, several states have had breeding bald eagles for the first time in years.
While habitat loss still remains a threat to the bald eagle's full recovery, most experts agree that it is making encouraging progress.
Soon our national symbol soaring the skies may become a common sight for Americans to once again behold.

Whereas the Federal Flag Code does not provide penalties for certain conduct or may not govern certain practices, state laws often do.
At the national level, the Federal Flag Code (Title 36, U.S. Code, paragraph 170-178) provides uniform guidelines for the display of, and respect shown to, Our Flag, and conduct during playing of the National Anthem and the Pledge of Allegiance to the Flag.
The Code is designed 'for the use of such civilian groups of organizations as may not be required to conform with regulations promulgated by one or more executive departments' of the federal government, such as the armed forces.
The Flag Code does not prescribe any penalties for non-compliance nor does it include enforcement provisions.
Rather, it functions as a guide to be voluntarily followed by civilians and civilian groups.
While the Code empowers the President of the United States to alter, modify, repeal or prescribe additional rules regarding the Flag, no federal agency has the authority to issue 'official' rulings legally binding on civilians or civilian groups.
Consequently, different interpretations of various provisions of the Code may continue to be made.
The Flag Code may be fairly tested: 'No disrespect should be shown to the Flag of the United States of America.'
Therefore, actions not specifically included in the Code may be deemed acceptable as long as proper respect is shown.

Now we are engaged in a great civil war, testing whether that nation or any nation so conceived and so dedicated can long endure.
We are met on a great battlefield of that war.
We have come to dedicate a portion of that field as a final resting-place for those who here gave their lives that that nation might live.
It is altogether fitting and proper that we should do this.
But in a larger sense, we cannot dedicate, we cannot consecrate, we cannot hallow this ground.
The brave men, living and dead who struggled here have consecrated it far above our poor power to add or detract.
The world will little note nor long remember what we say here, but it can never forget what they did here.
It is for us the living rather to be dedicated here to the unfinished work which they who fought here have thus far so nobly advanced.
It is rather for us to be here dedicated to the great task remaining before us--that from these honored dead we take increased devotion to that cause for which they gave the last full measure of devotion--that we here highly resolve that these dead shall not have died in vain, that this nation under God shall have a new birth of freedom, and that government of the people, by the people, for the people shall not perish from the earth.

November 2001 Delivered on the steps at the Lincoln Memorial in Washington D.C. on August 28, 1963 Five score years ago, a great American, in whose symbolic shadow we stand signed the Emancipation Proclamation.
This momentous decree came as a great beacon light of hope to millions of Negro slaves who had been seared in the flames of withering injustice.
It came as a joyous daybreak to end the long night of captivity.
But one hundred years later, we must face the tragic fact that the Negro is still not free.
One hundred years later, the life of the Negro is still sadly crippled by the manacles of segregation and the chains of discrimination.
One hundred years later, the Negro lives on a lonely island of poverty in the midst of a vast ocean of material prosperity.
One hundred years later, the Negro is still languishing in the corners of American society and finds himself an exile in his own land.
So we have come here today to dramatize an appalling condition.
In a sense we have come to our nation's capital to cash a check.
When the architects of our republic wrote the magnificent words of the Constitution and the declaration of Independence, they were signing a promissory note to which every American was to fall their.
This note was a promise that all men would be guarranteed the inalienable rights of life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.
It is obvious today that America has defaulted on this promissory note insofar as her citizens of color are concerned.
Instead of honoring this sacred obligation, America has given the Negro people a bad check which has come back marked "insufficient funds."
But we refuse to believe that the bank of justice is bankrupt.
We refuse to believe that there are insufficient funds in the great vaults of opportunity of this nation.
So we have come to cash this check -- a check that will give us upon demand the riches of freedom and the security of justice.
We have also come to this hallowed spot to remind America of the fierce urgency of now.
This is no time to engage in the luxury of cooling off or to take the tranquilizing drug of gradualism.
Now is the time to rise from the dark and desolate valley of segregation to the sunlit path of racial justice.
Now is the time to open the doors of opportunity to all of God's children.
Now is the time to lift our nation from the quicksands of racial injustice to the solid rock of brotherhood.
It would be fatal for the nation to overlook the urgency of the moment and to underestimate the determination of the Negro.
This sweltering summer of the Negro's legitimate discontent will not pass until there is an invigorating autumn of freedom and equality.
Nineteen sixty-three is not an end, but a beginning.
Those who hope that the Negro needed to blow off steam and will now be content will have a rude awakening if the nation returns to business as usual.
There will be neither rest nor tranquility in America until the Negro is granted his citizenship rights.
The whirlwinds of revolt will continue to shake the foundations of our nation until the bright day of justice emerges.
But there is something that I must say to my people who stand on the warm threshold which leads into the palace of justice.
In the process of gaining our rightful place we must not be guilty of wrongful deeds.
Let us not seek to satisfy our thirst for freedom by drinking from the cup of bitterness and hatred.
We must forever conduct our struggle on the high plane of dignity and discipline.
We must not allow our creative protest to degenerate into physical violence.
Again and again we must rise to the majestic heights of meeting physical force with soul force.
The marvelous new militancy which has engulfed the Negro community must not lead us to distrust of all white people, for many of our white brothers, as evidenced by their presence here today, have come to realize that their destiny is tied up with our destiny and their freedom is inextricably bound to our freedom.
We cannot walk alone.
And as we walk, we must make the pledge that we shall march ahead.
We cannot turn back.
There are those who are asking the devotees of civil rights, "When will you be satisfied?" We can never be satisfied as long as our bodies, heavy with the fatigue of travel, cannot gain lodging in the motels of the highways and the hotels of the cities.
We cannot be satisfied as long as the Negro's basic mobility is from a smaller ghetto to a larger one.
We can never be satisfied as long as a Negro in Mississippi cannot vote and a Negro in New York believes he has nothing for which to vote.
No, no, we are not satisfied, and we will not be satisfied until justice rolls down like waters and righteousness like a mighty stream.
I am not unmindful that some of you have come here out of great trials and tribulations.
Some of you have come fresh from narrow cells.
Some of you have come from areas where your quest for freedom left you battered by the storms of persecution and staggered by the winds of police brutality.
You have been the veterans of creative suffering.
Continue to work with the faith that unearned suffering is redemptive.
Go back to Mississippi, go back to Alabama, go back to Georgia, go back to Louisiana, go back to the slums and ghettos of our northern cities, knowing that somehow this situation can and will be changed.
Let us not wallow in the valley of despair.
I say to you today, my friends, that in spite of the difficulties and frustrations of the moment, I still have a dream.
It is a dream deeply rooted in the American dream.
I have a dream that one day this nation will rise up and live out the true meaning of its creed: "We hold these truths to be selfevident: that all men are created equal."
I have a dream that one day on the red hills of Georgia the sons of former slaves and the sons of former slaveowners will be able to sit down together at a table of brotherhood.
I have a dream that one day even the state of Mississippi, a desert state, sweltering with the heat of injustice and oppression, will be transformed into an oasis of freedom and justice.
I have a dream that my four children will one day live in a nation where they will not be judged by the color of their skin but by the content of their character.
I have a dream today.
I have a dream that one day the state of Alabama, whose governor's lips are presently dripping with the words of interposition and nullification, will be transformed into a situation where little black boys and black girls will be able to join hands with little white boys and white girls and walk together as sisters and brothers.
I have a dream today.
I have a dream that one day every valley shall be exalted, every hill and mountain shall be made low, the rough places will be made plain, and the crooked places will be made straight, and the glory of the Lord shall be revealed, and all flesh shall see it together.
This is our hope.
This is the faith with which I return to the South.
With this faith we will be able to hew out of the mountain of despair a stone of hope.
With this faith we will be able to transform the jangling discords of our nation into a beautiful symphony of brotherhood.
With this faith we will be able to work together, to pray together, to struggle together, to go to jail together, to stand up for freedom together, knowing that we will be free one day.
This will be the day when all of God's children will be able to sing with a new meaning, "My country, 'tis of thee, sweet land of liberty, of thee I sing.
Land where my fathers died, land of the pilgrim's pride, from every mountainside, let freedom ring."
And if America is to be a great nation this must become true.
So let freedom ring from the prodigious hilltops of New Hampshire.
Let freedom ring from the mighty mountains of New York.
Let freedom ring from the heightening Alleghenies of Pennsylvania! Let freedom ring from the snowcapped Rockies of Colorado! Let freedom ring from the curvaceous peaks of California! But not only that; let freedom ring from Stone Mountain of Georgia! Let freedom ring from Lookout Mountain of Tennessee! Let freedom ring from every hill and every molehill of Mississippi.
From every mountainside, let freedom ring.
When we let freedom ring, whem we let it ring from every village and every hamlet, from every state and every city, we will be able to speed up that day when all of God's children, black men and white men, Jews and Gentiles, Protestants and Catholics, will be able to join hands and sing in the words of the old Negro spiritual, "Free at last! free at last! thank God Almighty, we are free at last!"

The eyes of the world are upon you.
The hopes and prayers of liberty-loving peoples everywhere march with you.
You will bring about the destruction of the German war machine, the elimination of Nazi tyranny over the oppressed peoples of Europe, and security for ourselves in a free world.
Your task will not be an easy one.
Your enemy is well trained, well equipped, and battle-hardened.
He will fight savagely.
But this is the year 1944.
Much has happened since the Nazi triumphs of 1940-41.
The United Nations have infiicted upon the Germans great defeat in open battle man to man.
Our air offensive has seriously reduced their strength in the air and their capacity to wage war on the ground.
Our home fronts have given us an overwhelming superiority in weapons and munitions of war and placed at our disposal great reserves of trained fighting men.
The tide has turned.
The free men of the world are marching together to victory.
I have full confidence in your courage, devotion to duty, and skill in battle.
We will accept nothing less than full victory.
Good luck, and let us all beseech the blessings of Almighty God upon this great and noble undertaking.

We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty, and the pursuit of Happiness.
That to secure these rights, Governments are instituted among Men, deriving their just powers from the consent of the governed.
That whenever any Form of Government becomes destructive of these ends, it is the Right of the People to alter or to abolish it, and to institute new Government, laying its foundation on such principles and organizing its powers in such form, as to them shall seem most likely to effect their Safety and Happiness.
Prudence, indeed, will dictate that Governments long established should not be changed for light and transient causes; and accordingly all experience hath shewn, that mankind are more disposed to suffer, while evils are sufferable, than to right themselves by abolishing the forms to which they are accustomed.
But when a long train of abuses and usurpations, pursuing invariably the same object evinces a design to reduce them under absolute Despotism, it is their right, it is their duty, to throw off such Government, and to provide new Guards for their future security.
Such has been the patient sufferance of these Colonies; and such is now the necessity which constrains them to alter their former Systems of Government.
The history of the present King of Great Britain [George III] is a history of repeated injuries and usurpations, all having in direct object the establishment of an absolute Tyranny over these States.
To prove this, let Facts be submitted to a candid world.
He has refused his Assent to Laws, the most wholesome and necessary for the public good.
He has forbidden his Governors to pass Laws of immediate and pressing importance, unless suspended in their operation till his Assent should be obtained, and when so suspended, he has utterly neglected to attend to them.
He has refused to pass other Laws for the accommodation of large districts of people, unless those people would relinquish the right of Representation in the Legislature, a right inestimable to them and formidable to tyrants only.
He has called together legislative bodies at places unusual, uncomfortable, and distant from the depository of their public Records, for the sole purpose of fatiguing them into compliance with his measures.
He has dissolved Representative Houses repeatedly, for opposing with manly firmness his invasions on the rights of the people.
He has refused for a long time, after such dissolutions, to cause others to be elected; whereby the Legislative powers, incapable of Annihilation, have returned to the People at large for their exercise; the State remaining in the meantime exposed to all the dangers of invasion from without, and convulsions within.
He has endeavoured to prevent the population of these States; for that purpose obstructing the Laws for Naturalization of Foreigners; refusing to pass others to encourage their migrations hither, and raising the conditions of new Appropriations of Lands.
He has obstructed the Administration of Justice, by refusing his Assent to Laws for establishing Judiciary Powers.
He has made Judges dependent on his Will alone, for the tenure of their offices, and the amount and payment of their salaries.
He has erected a multitude of New Offices, and sent hither swarms of Officers to harass our people, and eat out their substance.
He has kept among us, in times of peace, Standing Armies, without the consent of our legislatures.
He has affected to render the Military independent of and superior to the Civil power.
He has combined with others to subject us to a jurisdiction foreign to our constitution and unacknowledged by our laws; giving his Assent to their Acts of pretended Legislation: For quartering large bodies of armed troops amoung us: For protecting them by a mock Trial from punishment for any Murders which they should commit on the Inhabitants of these States: For cutting off our Trade with all parts of the world: For imposing Taxes on us without our Consent: For depriving us in many cases of the benefits of Trial by Jury: For transporting us beyond Seas to be tried for pretended offences: For abolishing the free System of English Laws in a neighbouring Province, establishing therein an Arbitrary government, and enlarging its Boundaries so as to render it at once an example and fit instrument for introducing the same absolute rule into these Colonies: For taking away our Charters, abolishing our most valuable Laws and altering fundamentally the Forms of our Governments: For suspending our own Legislatures, and declaring themselves invested with power to legislate for us in all cases whatsoever.
He has abdicated Government here by declaring us out of his Protection and waging War against us.
He has plundered our seas, ravaged our Coasts, burnt our towns, and destroyed the lives of our people.
He is at this time transporting large Armies of foreign Mercenaries to complete the works of death, desolation and tyranny, already begun with circumstances of cruelty and perfidy scarcely paralleled in the most barbarous ages, and totally unworthy the Head of a civilized nation.
He has constrained our fellow Citizens taken Captive on the high Seas to bear Arms against their Country, to become the executioners of their friends and Brethren, or to fall themselves by their Hands.
He has excited domestic insurrections amongst us, and has endeavoured to bring on the inhabitants of our frontiers, the merciless Indian Savages, whose known rule of warfare is an undistinguished destruction of all ages, sexes and conditions.
In every stage of these Oppressions We have Petitioned for Redress in the most humble terms.
Our repeated Petitions have been answered only by repeated injury.
A Prince, whose character is thus marked by every act which may define a Tyrant, is unfit to be the ruler of a free people.
Nor have We been wanting in attentions to our British brethren.
We have warned them from time to time of attempts by their legislature to extend an unwarrantable jurisdiction over us.
We have reminded them of the circumstances of our emigration and settlement here.
We have appealed to their native justice and magnanimity, and we have conjured them by the ties of our common kindred to disavow these usurpations, which would inevitably interrupt our connections and correspondence.
They too have been deaf to the voice of justice and of consanguinity.
We must, therefore, acquiesce in the necessity, which denounces our Separation, and hold them, as we hold the rest of mankind, Enemies in War, in Peace Friends.
We, therefore, the Representatives of the United States of America, in General Congress, Assembled, appealing to the Supreme Judge of the world for the rectitude of our intentions, do, in the Name, and by the authority of the good People of these Colonies, solemnly publish and declare.

It declared, in part, "that these United Colonies are, and of right ought to be, free and independent states, that they are absolved from all allegiance to the British Crown, and that all political connection between them and the state of Great Britain is, and ought to be, totally dissolved".
The Declaration, which explained why the Colonies (now States) declared their Independence, was adopted by the Continental Congress July 4, 1776.
The leading draftsman was Thomas Jefferson, assisted by John Adams, Benjamin Franklin, Robert R. Livingston, and Roger Sherman.
The drafting of Declaration of Independence is detailed here.
Embassy of the United States of America Dag HammarskjÃ¯Â¿Â½lds VÃ¯Â¿Â½g 31, SE-115 89 Stockholm Home Public Affairs | US Mission | Commercial Service | Agricultural Service Consular Information | Fulbright | U.S. State Department | Defense Attache webmaster@usemb.se Last Updated: Monday, 26-Nov-2001 14:41:00 CET United States Embassy Stockholm The Flag of the United States The Stars and Stripes DECLARING INDEPENDENCE: DRAFTING THE DOCUMENTS November 2001 Thomas Jefferson drafted the Declaration of Independence in Philadelphia behind a veil of Congressionally imposed secrecy in June 1776 for a country wracked by military and political uncertainties.
In anticipation of a vote for independence, the Continental Congress on June 11 appointed Thomas Jefferson, John Adams, Benjamin Franklin, Roger Sherman, and Robert R. Livingston as a committee to draft a declaration of independence.
The committee then delegated Thomas Jefferson to undertake the task.
Jefferson worked diligently in private for days to compose a document.
Proof of the arduous nature of the work can be seen in the fragment of the first known composition draft of the declaration, which is on public display here for the first time.
Jefferson then made a clean or "fair" copy of the composition declaration, which became the foundation of the document, labeled by Jefferson as the "original Rough draught."
Revised first by Adams, then by Franklin, and then by the full committee, a total of forty-seven alterations including the insertion of three complete paragraphs was made on the text before it was presented to Congress on June 28.
After voting for independence on July 2, the Congress then continued to refine the document, making thirty-nine additional revisions to the committee draft before its final adoption on the morning of July 4.
The "original Rough draught" embodies the multiplicity of corrections, additions and deletions that were made at each step.
Although most of the alterations are in Jefferson's handwriting (Jefferson later indicated the changes he believed to have been made by Adams and Franklin), quite naturally he opposed many of the changes made to his document.
Congress then ordered the Declaration of Independence printed and late on July 4, John Dunlap, a Philadelphia printer, produced the first printed text of the Declaration of Independence, now known as the "Dunlap Broadside."
The next day John Hancock, the president of the Continental Congress, began dispatching copies of the Declaration to America's political and military leaders.
On July 9, George Washington ordered that his personal copy of the "Dunlap Broadside," sent to him by John Hancock on July 6, be read to the assembled American army at New York.
In 1783 at the war's end, General Washington brought his copy of the broadside home to Mount Vernon.
This remarkable document, which has come down to us only partially intact, is accompanied in this exhibit by a complete "Dunlap Broadside" -- one of only twenty-four known to exist.
On July 19, Congress ordered the production of an engrossed (officially inscribed) copy of the Declaration of Independence, which attending members of the Continental Congress, including some who had not voted for its adoption, began to sign on August 2, 1776.
This document is on permanent display at the National Archives.
On July 4, 1995, more than two centuries after its composition, the Declaration of Independence, just as Jefferson predicted on its fiftieth anniversary in his letter to Roger C. Weightman, towers aloft as "the signal of arousing men to burst the chains...to assume the blessings and security of self-government" and to restore "the free right to the unbounded exercise of reason and freedom of opinion."
These images are from a special exhibition in a series of public previews of unique documents from the collections of the Library of Congress.
These previews will culminate in the permanent exhibition, "Treasures of the Library of Congress," funded by the Xerox Foundation, which will open in 1997, the 100th anniversary of the Thomas Jefferson Building.

Fragment of George Washington's personal copy of the "Dunlap Broadside" (131k) of the Declaration of Independence, sent on July 6 to George Washington by John Hancock, president of the Continental Congress.The text is broken at lines thirty-four and fifty-four, with the text below line fifty-four missing.
General Washington had the Declaration read to his assembled troops in New York on July 9.
Later that night, the Americans destroyed a bronze statue of Great Britain's King George III (77k) which stood at the foot of Broadway on the Bowling Green (The tail of the horse is in the New York Historical Museum).
A contemporaneous print representing the committee of five delegates, chaired by Thomas Jefferson, that was appointed to prepare a declaration of independence.
They are shown submitting their draft of the Declaration of Independence to the Continental Congress, June 28, 1776 Edward Savage's engraving (86k), based on Robert Edge Pine's painting of the presentation of the Declaration of Independence to the Continental Congress, is considered one of the most realistic renditions of this historic event.
Jefferson is the tall person depositing the Declaration of Independence on the table.
Benjamin Franklin sits to his right.
John Hancock sits behind the table.
Fellow committee members, John Adams, Roger Sherman, and Robert R. Livingston stand (left to right) behind Jefferson.
An 1876 print representing the "Declaration Committee," (107k) chaired by Thomas Jefferson, which was charged in June 1776 with drafting a declaration of independence for action by the Continental Congress.
The "Declaration Committee," which included Thomas Jefferson of Virginia, Roger Sherman of Connecticut, Benjamin Franklin of Pennsylvania, Robert R. Livingston of New York, and John Adams of Massachusetts, was appointed by Congress on June 11, 1776, to draft a declaration in anticipation of an expected vote in favor of American independence, which occurred on July 2.
Currier and Ives prepared this imagined scene of the writing of the Declaration for the 100th anniversary of the Declaration of Independence.
