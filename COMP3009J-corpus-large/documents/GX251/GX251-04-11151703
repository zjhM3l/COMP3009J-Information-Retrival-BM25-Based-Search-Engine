WEEK OF OCTOBER 6 - 10, 2003 DAIRY MARKET NEWS NATIONAL DAIRY MARKET AT A GLANCE VOLUME 70, REPORT 41 CHICAGO MERCANTILE EXCHANGE (CME) CASH MARKETS (10/10): BUTTER: Grade AA closed at $1.1900.
The weekly average for Grade AA is 1.1833 (+.0041).
CHEESE: Barrels closed at $1.5500 and blocks at $1.6000.
The weekly average for barrels is $1.5430 (-.0140) and blocks, $1.6000 (N.C.).
BUTTER: Butter markets are mixed with the cash price recovering to $1.1900.
The market has not been this high since September 22.
Cream supplies are becoming more available as ice cream accounts slow their intake and fat tests on incoming milk receipts improve in some areas of the country.
Butter demand is fair with orders improving for the upcoming yearend holidays.
Preliminary orders indicate a good movement is anticipated in part due to the reasonable level of the current base price for butter.
August U.S. butter production was light compared to last year at 70.2 million pounds, down 21.1%.
Cumulative output for the first eight months of the year totals 867.1 million pounds, down 6.6% or 61.1 million pounds from the same period in 2002.
This works out, on average, to 1.75 million pounds less butter produced weekly compared to a year earlier.
CHEESE: The cheese market is steady on blocks and unsettled to weak on barrels.
Many buyers remain surprised by the stronger than expected natural market and prices.
Natural interest remains mostly fair to good with most orders of the fill-in variety.
Barrels are adequate to ample with process movement typically fair at best.
Cumulative January Â­ August 2003 cheddar cheese production totals 1,876.0 million pounds, down 71.0 million pounds (-3.6%) from the same period in 2002.
Total cheese output in 2003 totals 5,710.4 million pounds, unchanged from a year ago.
FLUID MILK: Milk production is steady to seasonally higher with most gains attributed to regions of the South.
Milk volumes shipped to Florida are reduced for the current week by 20 loads.
Class I interest is fair to good with bottling activity influencing available cream supplies in some areas.
Fluid milk movement into manufacturing facilities is increasing yet movement is slower than anticipated.
Condensed skim prices are unchanged and production is steady.
Increased interest in the more price attractive NDM is deterring interest in condensed skim, especially for Class III usage.
Cream supplies are increasing seasonally.
Multiples are trending lower and with decreases last week in the CME AA butter price, cream prices are reduced.
Decreased interest in cream from some ice cream operations is
encouraging interest from churns yet in general, cream prices remain higher than preferred by most butter operations.
DRY PRODUCTS: Dry product markets are trending steady to firm.
Production and spot trade of NDM are light yet supplies continue to flow to the CCC on the West coast.
NDM interest is predominantly expressed by cheese plants seeking a lower cost alternative to condensed skim and bakeries that are gearing up for the holiday season.
Buttermilk production is very light with supplies anticipated to increase with seasonal increases in churn activity.
Buttermilk trade is best in the West and nominal elsewhere.
Whey prices are unchanged to higher.
Offers at a discount and premium are reported with a mixed sentiment on export activity.
Lactose and WPC 34% markets are firm.
Supplies are limited for the good export and domestic interest.
CCC: During the period of October 1 - 10, CCC purchased 7,608,455 net pounds of nonfortified NDM and canceled 119,048 pounds of fortified NDM from the West.
AUGUST DAIRY PRODUCTS HIGHTLIGHTS (NASS): Butter production was 70.2 million pounds in August, 21.1% below August 2002 and 11.8% below July 2003.

Ice cream (hard) production totaled 75.6 million gallons, 3.0% below August 2002 and 8.9% below July 2003.
AUGUST FLUID MILK SALES (DAIRY PROGRAMS 
This was 3.7% lower than July 2002.
After adjusting for calendar composition, sales in August 2003 were 1.2% lower than August 2002.
On an individual product basis, after adjusting for calendar composition, sales of flavored fat-reduced milk increased from August 2002, while sales of whole milk, flavored whole milk, reduced fat (2%) milk, low fat (1%) milk, fat-free (skim) milk, and buttermilk decreased from a year earlier.

BUTTER MARKETS AUGUST BUTTER PRODUCTION During August, 2003, butter production in the United States totaled 70.2 million pounds, 21.1% less than August 2002 and 11.8% less than July 2003.
The following are August to August changes for various states: CA -24.0%, NY -1.2%, PA -15.4%, and WI -18.7%.
continue to be used to fill orders.
Although inventories are heavier than last year at this time, many producers and handlers are concerned about how quickly these stocks are declining.
Overall buying interest is fair.
With the year-end holidays not too far off, many buyers are placing orders for retail and food service needs.
Early orders are indicating that buyers anticipate strong sales for the holiday time with scheduled feature activity at retail.
Bulk butter for spot sale is in a range of flat to 2 cents per pound over various pricing basis.
NORTHEAST The market tone remains steady.
The cash price at the CME was mixed last week, ending the week on a "down note."
In the East, cream supplies are not as tight as they have been.
Some butter makers are a little more aggressive in their search for cream.
Some are paying prices that are competitive with the Class II trade.
Butter makers report that output is up slightly, but most continue to do some microfixing to fill print orders.
Demand for packaged butter at retail remains fair and food service orders are steady.
Sales of bulk butter f.o.b.
East, are reported in a range of flat market to 4 cents over the CME price/average.
WEST Churning levels are beginning to increase slowly as slightly more cream is becoming available.
Most feel that it will be at least the end of the month before there is much of a real increase.
Seasonal demand for bulk and print butter for the end of the year holidays is improving on a weekly basis.
Contacts believe that the overall sales volumes will probably be quite good this fall because of the generally low base price and the improving economy.
Butter is moving across the country and more is being pulled out of storage.
Weekly CME storage stocks declined by 7.1 million pounds last week and stand at 134.8 million pounds.
Stocks have declined by 73.7 million pounds over the last 12 weeks, faster than at any time previously.
August U.S. butter production was 70.15 million pounds, down 21.1% from last year (-18.7 million pounds).
Cumulative output through the first eight months of the year is 867.1 million pounds, a decline of 6.6% from last year (-61.1 million pounds).
That works out to 1.75 million pounds less butter produced each week this year compared to last year.
Many contacts believe that for the last few months, when cheese prices have been much higher than butter prices, lots of cream has been going into the cheese vats.
In August, the Western region produced 35.2 million pounds of butter which was about 50% of the U.S. total.
The August output in the West was down 20.7% from the previous year.
Current prices for bulk butter range from one cent under the market to 4 cents under the market based on the CME with various time frames and averages.
CENTRAL The cash butter price at the CME continues to edge lower.
Many producers and handlers are puzzled by this trend especially when cream supplies are limited to maintain steady/full production schedules.
Some butter producers indicate that cream supplies are somewhat more available, although still short of desired volumes.
In instances, butter producers are actively pursuing and paying higher than desired prices for cream supplies to generate additional butter stocks.
August butter production figures for the U.S. indicate that output for the month was 21.1% lighter than last August and 11.8% less than July.
These figures, along with lighter September churning schedules have some producers also questioning weaker prices.
Many producers are not able to fill orders with fresh production, thus inventories

The cheese market is steady on natural, unsettled to weak on barrels.
Current natural cheese movement remains uneven from week to week though overall fair to good.
Buyers are trying to keep just working inventories and reorder as product movement warrants.
Many buyers had expected natural prices to weaken and have had to replenish depleted supplies.
Some tightness is still noted on muenster with sharply higher premiums over recent years.
Process movement is generally fair at best.
Processing solids interest is somewhat better in October but the large volume continues to weigh down prices.
Barrel offerings are adequate to fully adequate.
Swiss undergrade supplies remain heavy with top grades tight.
Many cheddar aging programs have backed off on purchases in recent months because of current (relatively high) prices.
Current cheese output ranges from steady to occasionally slightly higher as cheese yields improve seasonally.
August 2003 total cheese production in selected Midwestern states compared to last August is: Wisconsin 185.3 million pounds, down 3.6 million pounds (-1.9%); Minnesota 48.9 million pounds, up 3.4 million pounds (7.4%); Iowa 19.5 million pounds, off 2.4 million pounds, (-11.0%); and Ohio 13.1 million pounds, up 975,000 pounds (8.1%).

WEST Natural and Swiss prices are holding steady while process cheese prices declined.
Block cheese prices at the CME have been unchanged for 49 trading sessions at $1.60.
Looking at historical patterns, it would be unusual for the price to hold much longer.
That is not to say that fundamentals might not be different this year and allow prices to hold longer than is normally expected.
With this in mind, many buyers are acquiring cheese to cover only ongoing needs.
Most don't think cheese supplies will be tight enough this fall to cause availability concerns.
Demand levels have improved since this past summer, but the relatively high base pricing for cheese is not helping move additional volumes.
Total cheese production for the U.S. through August is unchanged from last year at 5.71 billion pounds.
Breaking this total down by type of cheese indicates that American cheese production is down 1.7% or 43.6 million pounds and that Italian cheese output is up 1.8% or 41.9 million pounds.
For the month of August, U.S. total cheese output was down 0.8% from a year ago at 708.4 million pounds.
The Western region produced 291.1 million pounds of cheese, 41% of the U.S. total.
The regional output was up 3.0% from last year.

EDITOR'S NOTE: Due to changes in milk supply agreements, milk import/export totals are not directly comparable to year ago figures and to shipments prior to April 1, 2003.
Milk production continues to rebound, especially in areas of the South.
Milk imports into Florida are reduced by 20 loads compared to the week prior with supplies originating from MI, TX and parts of the Northeast.
Class I interest is mixed.
While sales are reportedly lighter in the South, good movement persists in the North where bottled milk demand has not yet waned from August and September, when school's resumed session.
Fluid milk demand into manufacturing is steady with plants operating below and at capacity depending on available surplus milk volumes.
Condensed skim interest is lighter than the week prior, especially into Class III operations where NDM is more price attractive.
Condensed skim prices are unchanged and production is steady.
Fluid cream supplies are increasing seasonally, especially in response to greater bottling activity in some areas.
Demand for fluid cream into ice cream operations is also beginning to taper in areas, supporting the trend in increased supplies.
Producers suspect that the seasonal flux in cream will be brief as production schedules are likely to gear up soon for holiday items such as cream cheese, egg nog, whipped cream and spreads.
Cream prices are lower in response to decreases in the CME AA weekly average price.
Multiples are not significantly reduced, deterring some cream movement into butter operations.
Churn activity remains light yet improved compared to the week prior.

Class I school accounts are settling into the usual pattern and scattered retail promotional activity continues to cause the usual fluctuations.
Current, higher Class I prices are impacting retail promotional activity in many markets.
Supplemental milk shipments to the Southeast continue from the region.
Manufacturing milk demand is steady to occasionally a little softer.
While some buyers continue to have problems acquiring additional milk supplies to help fill orders, a few others have cut back on spot purchases, at least temporarily.
Reported spot manufacturing milk prices range from $1.75 to around $2.50, net over class.
Condensed skim prices are steady.
Increased NDM sales are offsetting virtually no Class III condensed sales.
Cream demand is steady to often lighter from ice cream producers.
Some resistance was noted for cream priced at higher multiples.
Current plant milk intakes are little changed, though varying from slightly lower to slightly higher.
Fat and protein tests on incoming milk supplies continue to increase seasonally.
Killing frost has concluded the growing season
CALIFORNIA milk production levels are holding consistent with last week.
Conditions are improving for the milking herds as more seasonal weather develops.
Cooler nighttime temperatures are widespread and highs are moderate.
Plants are running well across the state with any additional milk able to be readily placed.
Fluid milk orders remain good with bottlers often busier than expected.
Solids' levels are showing slight increases in most areas.
ARIZONA milk output is steady to only slightly higher.
Processors are expecting milk supplies to increase from seasonal low levels, but that is happening slower than thought.
The hot weather cycles over the summer months were hard on the milking herds and the effects still linger.
Weather patterns are moderating and less stressful on cows.
Bottling milk demand is good for many accounts in the state.
NEW MEXICO milk supplies are beginning to trend seasonally higher with slight increases noted in fat and protein levels.

Sales to regular accounts are steady to higher.
Alfalfa prices in the state are holding steady.
Areas in the southwest corner are well into the sixth cutting.

The CME butter price continues to fluctuate higher and lower within at tight range and stood at $1.1900 on Wednesday, October 8.
There is a good call for cream from butter makers in the region.
Supplies are increasing with higher fat content in milk and continued skimming for fluid milk sales.
There is some shifting of demand away from ice cream and cheese production.
Western cream multiples are lower within the range from 118 to 130, FOB, depending on class usage and basing point.
Rain and cooler temperatures are common over much of the PACIFIC NORTHWEST.
This weather is slowing those trying to finish up the corn silage harvest.
Quality and tonnage look good for the winter feeding season.
Producers were surprised that the very short hot spell noted last week had as much impact on the milking herd as it did.
Declines of 4-5 pounds per day were common in many herds.
The issue seems to be that the summer stress has left the herd in a stage that leads to lower milk output with the smallest bit of additional stress.
Also, tests are not coming back very fast for this late in the year.
Plants are not happy with the yields that they are getting.
Culling rates continue at relatively high levels because of the excellent cull cow market available.
Heifer prices held steady in a light test at the latest Toppenish sale.
Buyers were not overly aggressive and offerings were lighter than expected.
Conditions are very seasonal and moderate in UTAH and IDAHO.
Milk output is increasing slowly, but tests continue to stay near low summer levels.
Plants are waiting for a turn around to add to yields.
Most of the fall hay and corn silage is completed and feed stocks look to be in good shape.
Contacts continue to note very good volumes of hay moving off farms and into dairy storage facilities.
The season and improving milk prices are given as reasons.
Prices are firmer by $5-10 per ton in instances.
Heifer prices in the region at a major auction continue to firm.
The high end is over $1900 and the average is over $1600.

WESTERN AND EASTERN EUROPE
OCEANIA OCEANIA OVERVIEW: Milk production in New Zealand and Australia continues to increase seasonally.
In New Zealand, milk producers experienced a strong start to the season with output running about 5% ahead of last year, while in Australia, reports indicate that July /August output was about 7% behind last year.
Australian milk producers and handlers state that Septembers weather and moisture conditions have improved to the point that some of the lack of milk early on in the production season will recover.
There are no official reports released as to recent milk volumes, but most handlers still are projecting an overall 1 Â­ 2% annual increase over last season in Australia.
Carryover stocks of manufactured dairy products from last season are very low, if any at all.
Manufacturers and handlers indicate that they are able to clean out the warehouses in preparation of new season production.
At this point, most sales activity is centering around regular customer needs with no significant new buyer interest being reported.
Some Oceania handlers indicated that some Russian buyers were looking for butterfat for upcoming winter needs.
Oceania prices have firmed in recent weeks, with many handlers questioning where these prices will settle.
At this point, Oceania is basically in the drivers seat with their new production season just getting underway and Northern hemisphere output on the down side.
Oceania stocks are once again building with inventoried volumes elsewhere in the world available but often not at levels of previous years.
BUTTER: Oceania butter markets and prices are firm.
Carryover stocks from last season are low, thus shipments of butter are clearing these minimal volumes and are being supplemented with new production.
At this time, most buyer interest and sales activity is centered around regular and ongoing customer needs.
Some Russian buyer interest is being reported, although the outcome of these inquiries is unclear.
82% BUTTERFAT: 1,425 - 1,550
OVERVIEW: WESTERN EUROPE: Milk receipts are declining seasonally within the EU. Milk receipts for the current season are about even with last season overall though lower in countries/areas most affected by the summer heat and drought.
Winter feed availability and generally higher feed prices are a concern for many farmers.
Culling animals to adjust to feed supplies is another option.
Some producers still have feed left over from last year and this should reduce the problem.
Current dairy product markets are steady in Europe based on Euros, but quotes are often higher when quoted in U.S. dollars.
The recent strength of the Euro relative to the weak U.S. dollar may adjust quoted prices by $30, depending on product, in just a couple of days.
Some effort is underway to try to convert potential international buyers to base price quotes in Euros.
Butter prices are firmer and intervention markets are only open in a few smaller markets due to market prices above intervention levels in the majority.
Extremely limited supplies of butteroil make price quotes nominal.
Good export interest is still noted from Russia as well as Japan.
Export demand has also firmed for skim and whole milk powder.
Algeria recently came out with a new tender for December/January delivery, reportedly seeking quotes on skim, whole milk, and butteroil.
BUTTER/BUTTEROIL: The butter little changed though prices expressed butteroil makes prices quoted nominal.
seeking to acquire additional volumes Supplemental butter supplies continue 82% BUTTERFAT: 99% BUTTERFAT:
market is firm.
Internal EU prices are in US dollars are higher.
The lack of Russian buyers are still in the market of butterfat.
Production is seasonal. to move out from PSA inventories.
1,550 - 1,700 1,750 - 2,000
SKIM MILK POWDER (SMP): Prices are higher when expressed in U.S. dollars though steady within the EU. Current production is trending lower seasonally.
Current dollar based quotes are close to US domestic prices.
Algeria recently came out with a tender seeking price quotes on an undetermined volume of powder for December/January delivery.
More powder is expected to be sold from inventory.
1.25% BUTTERFAT: 1,750 - 1,865
CHEDDAR CHEESE: Oceania cheese markets are firm, although prices are holding steady.
Cheese production is building seasonally as milk volumes increases in New Zealand and Australia.
Some handlers report that they have carry over stocks from last season, but these volumes are not burdensome as new stocks are generated.
At this point, most sales activity continues to center around regular and ongoing customer needs.
39% MAXIMUM MOISTURE: 1,950 - 2,100 Skim milk powder markets are firm with production season is increasing in Oceania are low from last season with some handlers Shipments of new season production are Australian shores.
1,750 - 1,850
WHOLE MILK POWDER (WMP): Prices are higher expressed in dollars and steady internally in the EU. Milk receipts continue to decline seasonally in the EU. Drying schedules are lighter seasonally.
Price quotes of $2000 or higher tend to sharply limit international interest.
26% BUTTERFAT: 1,900 - 2,040
