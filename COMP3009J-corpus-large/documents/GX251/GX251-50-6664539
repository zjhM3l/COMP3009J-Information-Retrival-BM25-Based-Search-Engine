FINDINGS.
Congress finds that-- (1) it is in the mutual interest of the United States and the countries of sub-Saharan Africa to promote stable and sustainable economic growth and development in sub-Saharan Africa;
H. R. 434--3 (2) the 48 countries of sub-Saharan Africa form a region richly endowed with both natural and human resources; (3) sub-Saharan Africa represents a region of enormous economic potential and of enduring political significance to the United States; (4) the region has experienced the strengthening of democracy as countries in sub-Saharan Africa have taken steps to encourage broader participation in the political process; (5) certain countries in sub-Saharan Africa have increased their economic growth rates, taken significant steps towards liberalizing their economies, and made progress toward regional economic integration that can have positive benefits for the region; (6) despite those gains, the per capita income in sub-Saharan Africa averages approximately $500 annually; (7) trade and investment, as the American experience has shown, can represent powerful tools both for economic development and for encouraging broader participation in a political process in which political freedom can flourish; (8) increased trade and investment flows have the greatest impact in an economic environment in which trading partners eliminate barriers to trade and capital flows and encourage the development of a vibrant private sector that offers individual African citizens the freedom to expand their economic opportunities and provide for their families; (9) offering the countries of sub-Saharan Africa enhanced trade preferences will encourage both higher levels of trade and direct investment in support of the positive economic and political developments under way throughout the region; and (10) encouraging the reciprocal reduction of trade and investment barriers in Africa will enhance the benefits of trade and investment for the region as well as enhance commercial and political ties between the United States and sub-Saharan Africa.

It is the sense of the Congress that-- (1) the position of Assistant United States Trade Representative for African Affairs is integral to the United States commitment to increasing United States-sub-Saharan African trade and investment; (2) the position of Assistant United States Trade Representative for African Affairs should be maintained within the Office of the United States Trade Representative to direct and coordinate interagency activities on United States-Africa trade policy and investment matters and serve as-- (A) a primary point of contact in the executive branch for those persons engaged in trade between the United States and sub-Saharan Africa; and (B) the chief advisor to the United States Trade Representative on issues of trade and investment with Africa; and (3) the United States Trade Representative should have adequate funding and staff to carry out the duties of the Assistant United States Trade Representative for African Affairs described in paragraph (2), subject to the availability of appropriations.

SENSE OF THE CONGRESS REGARDING COMPREHENSIVE DEBT RELIEF FOR THE WORLD'S POOREST COUNTRIES.
(a) FINDINGS.--Congress makes the following findings: (1) The burden of external debt has become a major impediment to economic growth and poverty reduction in many of the world's poorest countries.
(2) Until recently, the United States Government and other official creditors sought to address this problem by rescheduling loans and in some cases providing limited debt reduction.
H. R. 434--18 (3) Despite such efforts, the cumulative debt of many of the world's poorest countries continued to grow beyond their capacity to repay.
(4) In 1997, the Group of Seven, the World Bank, and the International Monetary Fund adopted the Heavily Indebted Poor Countries Initiative (HIPC), a commitment by the international community that all multilateral and bilateral creditors, acting in a coordinated and concerted fashion, would reduce poor country debt to a sustainable level.
(5) The HIPC Initiative is currently undergoing reforms to address concerns raised about country conditionality, the amount of debt forgiven, and the allocation of savings realized through the debt forgiveness program to ensure that the Initiative accomplishes the goals of economic growth and poverty alleviation in the world's poorest countries.
(b) SENSE OF THE CONGRESS.--It is the sense of the Congress that-- (1) Congress and the President should work together, without undue delay and in concert with the international community, to make comprehensive debt relief available to the world's poorest countries in a manner that promotes economic growth and poverty alleviation; (2) this program of bilateral and multilateral debt relief should be designed to strengthen and expand the private sector, encourage increased trade and investment, support the development of free markets, and promote broad-scale economic growth in beneficiary countries; (3) this program of debt relief should also support the adoption of policies to alleviate poverty and to ensure that benefits are shared widely among the population, such as through initiatives to advance education, improve health, combat AIDS, and promote clean water and environmental protection; (4) these debt relief agreements should be designed and implemented in a transparent manner and with the broad participation of the citizenry of the debtor country and should ensure that country circumstances are adequately taken into account; (5) no country should receive the benefits of debt relief if that country does not cooperate with the United States on terrorism or narcotics enforcement, is a gross violator of the human rights of its citizens, or is engaged in conflict or spends excessively on its military; and (6) in order to prevent adverse impact on a key industry in many developing countries, the International Monetary Fund must mobilize its own resources for providing debt relief to eligible countries without allowing gold to reach the open market, or otherwise adversely affecting the market price of gold.

EXECUTIVE BRANCH INITIATIVES.
(a) STATEMENT OF THE CONGRESS.--The Congress recognizes that the stated policy of the executive branch in 1997, the ``Partnership for Growth and Opportunity in Africa'' initiative, is a step toward the establishment of a comprehensive trade and development policy for sub-Saharan Africa.

H. R. 434--19 that this Partnership is a companion to the policy goals set forth in this title.
(b) TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE TO PROMOTE ECONOMIC REFORMS AND DEVELOPMENT.--In addition to continuing bilateral and multilateral economic and development assistance, the President shall target technical assistance toward-- (1) developing relationships between United States firms and firms in sub-Saharan Africa through a variety of business associations and networks; (2) providing assistance to the governments of sub-Saharan African countries to-- (A) liberalize trade and promote exports; (B) bring their legal regimes into compliance with the standards of the World Trade Organization in conjunction with membership in that Organization; (C) make financial and fiscal reforms; and (D) promote greater agribusiness linkages; (3) addressing such critical agricultural policy issues as market liberalization, agricultural export development, and agribusiness investment in processing and transporting agricultural commodities; (4) increasing the number of reverse trade missions to growth-oriented countries in sub-Saharan Africa; (5) increasing trade in services; and (6) encouraging greater sub-Saharan African participation in future negotiations in the World Trade Organization on services and making further commitments in their schedules to the General Agreement on Trade in Services in order to encourage the removal of tariff and nontariff barriers.

(b) STRUCTURE AND TYPES OF FUNDS.-- (1) STRUCTURE.--Each fund initiated under subsection (a) should be structured as a partnership managed by professional private sector fund managers and monitored on a continuing basis by the Corporation.
(2) CAPITALIZATION.--Each fund should be capitalized with a combination of private equity capital, which is not guaranteed by the Corporation, and debt for which the Corporation provides guaranties.
(3) INFRASTRUCTURE FUND.--One or more of the funds, with combined assets of up to $500,000,000, should be used in support of infrastructure projects in countries of sub-Saharan Africa.
(4) EMPHASIS.--The Corporation shall ensure that the funds are used to provide support in particular to women entrepreneurs and to innovative investments that expand opportunities for women and maximize employment opportunities for poor individuals.
(c) OVERSEAS PRIVATE INVESTMENT CORPORATION.--

R. 434--20 (1) INVESTMENT ADVISORY COUNCIL.--Section 233 of the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 is amended by adding at the end the following: ``(e) INVESTMENT ADVISORY COUNCIL.--The Board shall take prompt measures to increase the loan, guarantee, and insurance programs, and financial commitments, of the Corporation in subSaharan Africa, including through the use of an investment advisory council to assist the Board in developing and implementing policies, programs, and financial instruments with respect to sub-Saharan Africa.

The investment advisory council shall terminate 4 years after the date of the enactment of this subsection.''.
(2) REPORTS TO CONGRESS.--Within 6 months after the date of the enactment of this Act, and annually for each of the 4 years thereafter, the Board of Directors of the Overseas Private Investment Corporation shall submit to Congress a report on the steps that the Board has taken to implement section 233(e) of the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 (as added by paragraph (1)) and any recommendations of the investment advisory council established pursuant to such section.

(b) SUB-SAHARAN AFRICA ADVISORY COMMITTEE.--The subSaharan Africa Advisory Committee (SAAC) is to be commended for aiding the Bank in advancing the economic partnership between the United States and the nations of sub-Saharan Africa by doubling the number of sub-Saharan African countries in which the Bank is open for traditional financing and by increasing by tenfold the Bank's support for sales to sub-Saharan Africa from fiscal year 1998 to fiscal year 1999.
The Board of Directors of the Bank and its staff shall continue to review carefully the sub-Saharan Africa Advisory Committee recommendations on the development and implementation of new and innovative policies and programs designed to promote the Bank's expansion in sub-Saharan Africa.

125.
EXPANSION OF THE UNITED STATES AND FOREIGN COMMERCIAL SERVICE IN SUB-SAHARAN AFRICA.
(a) FINDINGS.--The Congress makes the following findings: (1) The United States and Foreign Commercial Service (hereafter in this section referred to as the ``Commercial Service'') plays an important role in helping United States businesses identify export opportunities and develop reliable sources of information on commercial prospects in foreign countries.
(2) During the 1980s, the presence of the Commercial Service in sub-Saharan Africa consisted of 14 professionals providing services in eight countries.
By early 1997, that presence had been reduced by half to seven professionals in only four countries.
H. R. 434--21 (3) Since 1997, the Department of Commerce has slowly begun to increase the presence of the Commercial Service in sub-Saharan Africa, adding five full-time officers to established posts.
(4) Although the Commercial Service Officers in these countries have regional responsibilities, this kind of coverage does not adequately service the needs of United States businesses attempting to do business in sub-Saharan Africa.
(5) The Congress has, on several occasions, encouraged the Commercial Service to focus its resources and efforts in countries or regions in Europe or Asia to promote greater United States export activity in those markets, and similar encouragement should be provided for countries in sub-Saharan Africa as well.
(6) Because market information is not widely available in many sub-Saharan African countries, the presence of additional Commercial Service Officers and resources can play a significant role in assisting United States businesses in markets in those countries.
(b) APPOINTMENTS.--Subject to the availability of appropriations, by not later than December 31, 2001, the Secretary of Commerce, acting through the Assistant Secretary of Commerce and Director General of the United States and Foreign Commercial Service, shall take steps to ensure that-- (1) at least 20 full-time Commercial Service employees are stationed in sub-Saharan Africa; and (2) full-time Commercial Service employees are stationed in not less than 10 different sub-Saharan African countries.
(c) INITIATIVE FOR SUB-SAHARAN AFRICA.--In order to encourage the export of United States goods and services to sub-Saharan African countries, the International Trade Administration shall make a special effort to-- (1) identify United States goods and services which are the best prospects for export by United States companies to sub-Saharan Africa; (2) identify, where appropriate, tariff and nontariff barriers that are preventing or hindering sales of United States goods and services to, or the operation of United States companies in, sub-Saharan Africa; (3) hold discussions with appropriate authorities in subSaharan Africa on the matters described in paragraphs (1) and (2) with a view to securing increased market access for United States exporters of goods and services; (4) identify current resource allocations and personnel levels in sub-Saharan Africa for the Commercial Service and consider plans for the deployment of additional resources or personnel to that region; and (5) make available to the public, through printed and electronic means of communication, the information derived pursuant to paragraphs (1) through (4) for each of the 4 years after the date of the enactment of this Act.

ADDITIONAL AUTHORITIES AND INCREASED FLEXIBILITY TO PROVIDE ASSISTANCE UNDER THE DEVELOPMENT FUND FOR AFRICA.
(a) USE OF SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT ASSISTANCE TO SUPFURTHER ECONOMIC GROWTH.--It is the sense of the Congress that sustained economic growth in sub-Saharan Africa depends in large measure upon the development of a receptive environment for trade and investment, and that to achieve this objective the United States Agency for International Development should continue to support programs which help to create this environment.
Investments in human resources, development, and implementation of free market policies, including policies to liberalize agricultural markets and improve food security, and the support for the rule of law and democratic governance should continue to be encouraged and enhanced on a bilateral and regional basis.
(b) DECLARATIONS OF POLICY.--The Congress makes the following declarations: (1) The Development Fund for Africa established under chapter 10 of part I of the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 (22 U.S.C. 2293 et seq.) has been an effective tool in providing development assistance to sub-Saharan Africa since 1988.
(2) The Development Fund for Africa will complement the other provisions of this title and lay a foundation for increased trade and investment opportunities between the United States and sub-Saharan Africa.
(3) Assistance provided through the Development Fund for Africa will continue to support programs and activities that promote the long term economic development of sub-Saharan Africa, such as programs and activities relating to the following: (A) Strengthening primary and vocational education systems, especially the acquisition of middle-level technical skills for operating modern private businesses and the introduction of college level business education, including the study of international business, finance, and stock exchanges.
(B) Strengthening health care systems.
(C) Supporting democratization, good governance and civil society and conflict resolution efforts.
(D) Increasing food security by promoting the expansion of agricultural and agriculture-based industrial production and productivity and increasing real incomes for poor individuals.
(E) Promoting an enabling environment for private sector-led growth through sustained economic reform, privatization programs, and market-led economic activities.
(F) Promoting decentralization and local participation in the development process, especially linking the rural production sectors and the industrial and market centers throughout Africa.
(G) Increasing the technical and managerial capacity of sub-Saharan African individuals to manage the economy of sub-Saharan Africa.
PORT
H. R. 434--23 (H) Ensuring sustainable economic growth through environmental protection.
(4) The African Development Foundation has a unique congressional mandate to empower the poor to participate fully in development and to increase opportunities for gainful employment, poverty alleviation, and more equitable income distribution in sub-Saharan Africa.
The African Development Foundation has worked successfully to enhance the role of women as agents of change, strengthen the informal sector with an emphasis on supporting micro and small sized enterprises, indigenous technologies, and mobilizing local financing.
The African Development Foundation should develop and implement strategies for promoting participation in the socioeconomic development process of grassroots and informal sector groups such as nongovernmental organizations, cooperatives, artisans, and traders into the programs and initiatives established under this title.
(c) ADDITIONAL AUTHORITIES.-- (1) IN GENERAL.--Section 496(h) of the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 (22 U.S.C. 2293(h)) is amended-- (A) by redesignating paragraph (3) as paragraph (4); and (B) by inserting after paragraph (2) the following: ``(3) DEMOCRATIZATION AND CONFLICT RESOLUTION CAPABILITIES.--Assistance under this section may also include program assistance-- ``(A) to promote democratization, good governance, and strong civil societies in sub-Saharan Africa; and ``(B) to strengthen conflict resolution capabilities of governmental, intergovernmental, and nongovernmental entities in sub-Saharan Africa.''.
(2) CONFORMING AMENDMENT.--Section 496(h)(4) of such Act, as amended by paragraph (1), is further amended by striking ``paragraphs (1) and (2)'' in the first sentence and inserting ``paragraphs (1), (2), and (3)''.

In providing such assistance, United States businesses should be encouraged to consider the establishment of an HIV/AIDS Response Fund in order to provide for coordination among such businesses in the collection and distribution of the assistance to sub-Saharan African countries.

SENSE OF THE CONGRESS RELATING TO HIV/AIDS CRISIS IN SUB-SAHARAN AFRICA.
(a) FINDINGS.--The Congress finds the following: (1) Sustained economic development in sub-Saharan Africa depends in large measure upon successful trade with and foreign assistance to the countries of sub-Saharan Africa.
(2) The HIV/AIDS crisis has reached epidemic proportions in sub-Saharan Africa, where more than 21,000,000 men, women, and children are infected with HIV.
H. R. 434--24 (3) Eighty-three percent of the estimated 11,700,000 deaths from HIV/AIDS worldwide have been in sub-Saharan Africa.
(4) The HIV/AIDS crisis in sub-Saharan Africa is weakening the structure of families and societies.
(5)(A) The HIV/AIDS crisis threatens the future of the workforce in sub-Saharan Africa.
(B) Studies show that HIV/AIDS in sub-Saharan Africa most severely affects individuals between the ages of 15 and 49--the age group that provides the most support for the economies of sub-Saharan African countries.
(6) Clear evidence demonstrates that HIV/AIDS is destructive to the economies of sub-Saharan African countries.
(7) Sustained economic development is critical to creating the public and private sector resources in sub-Saharan Africa necessary to fight the HIV/AIDS epidemic.
(b) SENSE OF THE CONGRESS.--It is the sense of the Congress that-- (1) addressing the HIV/AIDS crisis in sub-Saharan Africa should be a central component of United States foreign policy with respect to sub-Saharan Africa; (2) significant progress needs to be made in preventing and treating HIV/AIDS in sub-Saharan Africa in order to sustain a mutually beneficial trade relationship between the United States and sub-Saharan African countries; and (3) the HIV/AIDS crisis in sub-Saharan Africa is a global threat that merits further attention through greatly expanded public, private, and joint public-private efforts, and through appropriate United States legislation.

R. 434--25 (2) over 1,000,000 hectares of Africa are affected by desertification; (3) dryland degradation is an underlying cause of recurrent famine in Africa; (4) the United Nations Environment Programme estimates that desertification costs the world $42,000,000,000 a year, not including incalculable costs in human suffering; and (5) the United States can strengthen its partnerships throughout Africa and other countries affected by desertification, help alleviate social and economic crises caused by misuse of natural resources, and reduce dependence on foreign aid, by taking a leading role to combat desertification.

SHORT TITLE.
This title may be cited as the ``United States-Caribbean Basin Trade Partnership Act''.
SEC.
202.
FINDINGS AND POLICY.
(a) FINDINGS.--Congress makes the following findings: (1) The Caribbean Basin Economic Recovery Act (in this title referred to as ``CBERA'') represents a permanent commitment by the United States to encourage the development of strong democratic governments and revitalized economies in neighboring countries in the Caribbean Basin.
(2) In 1998, Hurricane Mitch and Hurricane Georges devastated areas in the Caribbean Basin region, killing more than 10,000 people and leaving 3,000,000 homeless.
(3) The total direct impact of Hurricanes Mitch and Georges on Honduras, Nicaragua, the Dominican Republic, El Salvador, and Guatemala amounts to $4,200,000,000, representing a severe loss to income levels in this underdeveloped region.
(4) In addition to short term disaster assistance, United States policy toward the region should focus on expanding
H. R. 434--26 international trade with the Caribbean Basin region as an enduring solution for successful economic growth and recovery.
(5) Thirty-four democratically elected leaders agreed at the 1994 Summit of the Americas to conclude negotiation of a Free Trade Area of the Americas (in this title referred to as ``FTAA'') by the year 2005.
(6) The economic security of the countries in the Caribbean Basin will be enhanced by the completion of the FTAA. (7) Offering temporary benefits to Caribbean Basin countries will preserve the United States commitment to Caribbean Basin beneficiary countries, promote the growth of free enterprise and economic opportunity in these neighboring countries, and thereby enhance the national security interests of the United States.
(8) Given the greater propensity of countries located in the Western Hemisphere to use United States components and to purchase United States products compared to other countries, increased trade and economic activity between the United States and countries in the Western Hemisphere will create new jobs in the United States as a result of expanding export opportunities.
(b) POLICY.--It is the policy of the United States-- (1) to offer Caribbean Basin beneficiary countries willing to prepare to become a party to the FTAA or another free trade agreement, tariff treatment essentially equivalent to that accorded to products of NAFTA countries for certain products not currently eligible for duty-free treatment under the CBERA; and (2) to seek the participation of Caribbean Basin beneficiary countries in the FTAA or another free trade agreement at the earliest possible date, with the goal of achieving full participation in such agreement not later than 2005.

AGRICULTURAL TRADE NEGOTIATING OBJECTIVES AND CONSULTATIONS WITH CONGRESS.
(a) FINDINGS.--Congress finds that-- (1) United States agriculture contributes positively to the United States balance of trade and United States agricultural exports support in excess of 1,000,000 United States jobs; (2) United States agriculture competes successfully worldwide despite the fact that United States producers are at a competitive disadvantage because of the trade distorting support and subsidy practices of other countries and despite the fact that significant tariff and nontariff barriers exist to United States exports; and (3) a successful conclusion of the current World Trade Organization agricultural negotiations is critically important to the United States agricultural sector.
(b) OBJECTIVES.--The agricultural trade negotiating objectives of the United States with respect to the current World Trade Organization agricultural negotiations include as matters of the highest priority-- (1) the expeditious elimination of all export subsidies worldwide while maintaining bona fide food aid and preserving United States market development and export credit programs that allow the United States to compete with other foreign export promotion efforts;
H. R. 434--46 (2) leveling the playing field for United States producers of agricultural products by eliminating blue box subsidies and disciplining domestic supports in a way that forces producers to face world prices on all production in excess of domestic food security needs while allowing the preservation of nontrade distorting programs to support family farms and rural communities; (3) the elimination of state trading enterprises or the adoption of rigorous disciplines that ensure operational transparency, competition, and the end of discriminatory pricing practices, including policies supporting cross-subsidization and price undercutting in export markets; (4) affirming that the World Trade Organization Agreement on the Application of Sanitary and Phytosanitary Measures applies to new technologies, including biotechnology, and that labeling requirements to allow consumers to make choices regarding biotechnology products or other regulatory requirements may not be used as disguised barriers to trade; (5) increasing opportunities for United States exports of agricultural products by reducing tariffs to the same levels that exist in the United States or to lower levels and by eliminating all nontariff barriers, including-- (A) restrictive or trade distorting practices, including those that adversely impact perishable or cyclical products; (B) restrictive rules in the administration of tariffrate quotas; and (C) other barriers to agriculture trade, including unjustified restrictions or commercial requirements affecting new technologies, including biotechnology; (6) eliminating government policies that create pricedepressing surpluses; and (7) strengthening dispute settlement procedures to ensure prompt compliance by foreign governments with their World Trade Organization obligations including commitments not to maintain unjustified restrictions on United States exports.
(c) CONSULTATION WITH CONGRESSIONAL COMMITTEES.-- (1) CONSULTATION BEFORE OFFER MADE.--In developing and before submitting an initial or revised negotiating proposal that would reduce United States tariffs on agricultural products or require a change in United States agricultural law, the United States Trade Representative shall consult with the Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry and the Committee on Finance of the Senate and the Committee on Agriculture and the Committee on Ways and Means of the House of Representatives.
(2) CONSULTATION WITH CONGRESSIONAL TRADE ADVISERS.-- Prior to and during the course of current negotiations on agricultural trade, the United States Trade Representative shall consult closely with the congressional trade advisers.
(3) CONSULTATION BEFORE AGREEMENT INITIALED.--Not less than 48 hours before initialing an agreement reached as part of current World Trade Organization agricultural negotiations, the United States Trade Representative shall consult closely with the committees referred to in paragraph (1) regarding-- (A) the details of the agreement; (B) the potential impact of the agreement on United States agricultural producers; and
H. R. 434--47 (C) any changes in United States law necessary to implement the agreement.
(4) DISCLOSURE OF COMMITMENTS.--Any agreement or other understanding addressing agricultural trade with a foreign government or governments (whether oral or in writing) that relates to a trade agreement with respect to which Congress must enact implementing legislation and that is not disclosed to Congress before legislation implementing that agreement is introduced in either House of Congress shall not be considered to be part of the agreement approved by Congress and shall have no force and effect under United States law or in any dispute settlement body.
(d) SENSE OF THE CONGRESS.--It is the sense of the Congress that-- (1) granting the President trade negotiating authority is essential to the successful conclusion of the new round of World Trade Organization agricultural negotiations; (2) reaching a successful agreement on agriculture should be the top priority of United States negotiators; and (3) if by the conclusion of the negotiations, the primary agricultural competitors of the United States do not agree to reduce their trade distorting domestic supports and eliminate export subsidies in accordance with the negotiating objectives expressed in this section, the United States should take steps to increase the leverage of United States negotiators and level the playing field for United States producers.
