Enjoy! ! Annual Clean Marina Awards Ceremony Set for August 2003 Each summer the Clean Marina Initiative hosts an annual awards ceremony to recognize marinas certified in the preceding year.
The ceremony is a time to spotlight the great pollution prevention practices under way throughout the industry and to thank these marina and boatyard operators for their efforts to protect Maryland's waterways.
The day will consist of remarks from a DNR representative (Secretary C. Ronald Franks has been invited), a representative from the Marine Trades Association of Maryland, and elected officials.
The press is invited along with State representatives from each Clean Marina's district.
Clean Marinas from the past year are presented citations, enjoy lunch, and round out the day with a tour of the host facility.
This year, at least 15 facilities will be recognized at the event being planned for the first week in August.
The timing was chosen to coincide with "National Marina Day," which is an effort of the Marina Operators Association of America (MOAA) to celebrate the rich history of the marina industry as well as its bright future.
National Marina Day focuses on the role of marinas as family-friendly gateways to boating and as stewards of the environment.
To learn more about this event, slated nationally for August 9th, visit www.moaa.com.
The goal of the Clean Marina Initiative is to certify twenty five percent of Maryland's approximately 600 boating facilities as Clean Marinas by the end of 2004.
While not an unrealistic goal, presently just 11% have been certified (58 Clean Marinas and 12 Clean Marina Partners).
Marinas, boatyards, and yacht clubs are strongly encouraged to participate in this voluntary program aimed at preventing future regulation of this industry.
For more information on the steps to certification, to obtain a Clean Marina Guidebook and Award Checklist, or to schedule an informal walk through to assess a facility, call 410-260-8770.
Program information and publications are also available by visiting www.dnr.state.md.us/boating .

I NSIDE T HIS ISSUE ... 2 2 3 1 Clean Marina Initiative Progress Report Marketing Tips for Marinas Two New Clean Marinas! B Clean Marina Program Progress Report TWO NEW CERTIFIED CLEAN MARINAS Knapps Narrows Marina (Tilghman Island) and Oak Harbor Marina (Pasadena) both recently became certified Clean Marinas.
To become a certified Clean Marina, managers must implement measures to control pollution associated with vessel maintenance and repair; petroleum storage and transfer; sewage disposal; solid, liquid and hazardous wastes; stormwater runoff; and facilities management.
Best management practices for all these topics are offered in the Maryland Clean Marina Guidebook.
Mark Julyan, General Manager of Knapps Narrows Marina, maintains a clean marina by insisting on vacuum sanding in the yard and using ground tarps when heavy work is being conducted.
Mark also enforces strict rules on the fuel dock and gives each customer a small oil-sorb cloth to capture any drips or spills.
Additionally, he has strengthened his contracts with all slip holders, land storage customers, and subcontractors to include the statement that the marina follows Clean Marina practices and expects all customers to do the same.
Knapps Narrows Marina also took advantage of Clean Marina grant funding in 2001 to purchase a wash water recycling system, vacuum sanders, a high-volume lowpressure spray gun, and to install a vegetated riparian buffer to filter stormwater.
As reported in the last issue Ken and Barbara Broman, owners of Oak Harbor Marina, and their sons have made many of Under way, Sunset Marina (Ocean City) was certified this improvements to Oak Harbor Marina to earn their Award.

neglect and had collected many derelict boats, mysterious drums and lots of trash and debris.
The Bromans cut up and removed many abandoned boats, had old containers and drums professionally removed, and have put new yard rules into place to keep things moving in the right direction.
They have filled up several roll-off dumpsters with trash and debris from the yard, cleaning up from years of bad habits of previous land storage customers.
The Bromans have also improved employee training and emergency preparedness to become a Clean Marina.
Both new Clean Marinas have much to be proud of! ! Marina Partners.
There is clearly a long way to go, and ecause an aim of the Clean Marina Initiative is to prevent considerably more participation is needed.

This is a multi-year investment that requires upkeep, but over time can turn a drab facility into a showcase.
3. Make facilities inviting to visitors.
Signs directing visitors to docks or the marina office are welcoming to first-time visitors trying to locate a friend or family member 's boat.
Remember that the appearance of the facility is a calling card to present and future customers.
! Few marina operators have time during the boating season to visit neighboring facilities and see what "the other guys" are doing .
The Clean Marina staff, however, is continually visiting a variety of marinas, boatyards, and yacht clubs and has compiled a short list of marketing tips that can make a marina shine.
1. Make a good first impression.
What does the entry to the marina look like from the water and the road? Does the facility project a professional image? Docks should be neat and clean, and old dock boards should be replaced regularly.
Landside entrances should not contain dumpsters, spare parts, and the like.
2.
Invest in landscaping whenever possible.
Welltended flowerbeds, ornamental grasses, and buffers around parking areas serve three purposes.
