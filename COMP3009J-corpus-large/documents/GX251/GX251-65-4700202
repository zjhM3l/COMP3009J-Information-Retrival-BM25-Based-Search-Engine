IN TROD UCTI ON The beneficial effects to health of enhanced physical activity (PA) during adult years are numerous.
There is mounting evidence that such benefits include a reduction in morbidity and mortality from diseases of several body systems (Bouchard et al., 1994).
Much less evidence is available regarding the effects of an active lifestyle during childhood a n d adolescence on adult health.
The main reason for the paucity of information on the possible carryover of benefits from childhood to adulthood is the lack of longitudinal studies that have followed the same individuals over many years.
Ideally, one would need randomly to assign children into those who are given enhanced PA programs and those who remain sedentary over years and then observe the long-term effects of PA or of inactivity.
On ethical grounds, such studies are hard to justify (it is unethical to demand that children not engage in PA for an extended period o f time).
In addition, they are extremely expensive and logistically most complicated.
A secondbest alternative would be to conduct controlled intervention studies that last shorter periods and include several groups of subjects who span a wide age range (from childhood to middle age).
Such "mixed longitudinal" studies are feasible, but have yet to be launched.
Another approach is to identify adults with and without diseases and question them about their PA during earlier years.
Such "retrospective" studies are easier to perform, but their outcome depends on the ability of people to correctly remember and report their PA behavior during earlier years.
Conclusions derived from retrospective studies are less valid than those derived from longitudinal interventions.
The purpose of this article is to examine briefly the current evidence that enhanced PA during childhood and adolescence imparts immediate health benefits, or reduces risk f o r adult chronic disease.
Emphasis will be given to the following conditions: obesity, hypertension, abnormal plasma lipoprotein profile, and osteoporosis.
Table 19.1 summarizes the evidence attesting to such benefits.
SH ORT- TERM BEN EFIT S Before analyzing the carryover effects of childhood PA, one should identify the immediate effects of a training program (or an active lifestyle) on health-related risk factors.
These are measured while the program is still in progress, or immediately upon its conclusion.
Evidence for such benefits has been sought from intervention training programs that last a few weeks or several months at the most.
An alternative approach has been cross-sectional studies that compare children (or youth) who habitually engage in athletic pursuit with those who lead a sedentary lifestyle.
The drawback of the latter approach is that differences in health-related risk between groups might not be a result of the physical activity per se.
They may instead reflect heredity or events that took place before the child became physically active.

Many, cross-sectional studies suggest that obese children and youth are less active peers.
There is only scant evidence, though, that inactivity is a cause of (Roberts, 1993).
Training studies with nonobese youth have shown little or body adiposity (Wilmore, 1983).
However, enhanced PA with or without a did reduce % body fat or excess body weight in obese children and youth.

Some cross-sectional studies show a slightly higher resting blood pressure among sedentary adolescents compared with their active peers.
Most studies, however, do not show such a difference, particularly if the groups have the same adiposity level.
Training of healthy, previously inactive children o r adolescents who have a normal blood pressure induces little (1-6 mmHg) or no drop in blood pressure.
However, in adolescents with hypertension, training over several months does induce a reduction of both systolic and diastolic blood pressure.
Even though such a reduction is modest (around 10 mmHg), it may be beneficial for some individuals with mild hypertension who otherwise may require medication to control their blood pressure.
The training programs that induced a decline in blood pressure were comprised mostly of aerobic activities.
In o n e study (Hagberg et al., 1984), the inclusion of a five-month weight training regimen following a six-month aerobic program further reduced the blood pressure of adolescents with hypertension.
Such beneficial effects of exercise disappear within several months o f termination of the program.

Based on some cross-sectional studies, children and adolescents who are physically active, or whose aerobic fitness is high, have a more favorable blood lipid profile than their sedentary, or less fit, peers.
This difference is particularly apparent in high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C = the "good" cholesterol), which is higher in the active groups.
Other cross-sectional comparisons, however, do not reveal such differences.
In most of the cross-sectional studies it is impossible to separate a high activity level from a high fitness level.
Training studies of several weeks' duration have failed to show any beneficial effect o n the blood lipid profile in healthy children or adolescents.
More beneficial responses have been shown for groups who have a high coronary risk.
These include children a n d adolescents with insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus, obesity, or with at least one parent who has three or more coronary risk factors.

The possible link between skeletal health and PA has received attention in recent years with the finding that physically active postmenopausal women, and elderly populations in general, have a higher bone mineral density (BMD) and less osteoporosis than less active controls.
One of the determinants of bone health in old age is the "peak" BMD reached by young adulthood.
Bone mass and BMD subsequently (and inevitably) decline with the years, until the bones become fragile.
This topic has an important pediatric relevance, because the great majority of bone buildup occurs during adolescence.
A question of major public health relevance is whether enhanced PA during childhood and adolescence will result in a higher peak BMD.
Cross-sectional comparisons have shown that young athletes in weight-bearing sports such as gymnastics, soccer and volleyball (but not in non-weight-bearing sports such as swimming) have a higher BMD than do nonathletes.
Likewise, bones of the dominant limb i n "asymmetrical" sports, such as tennis or little-league pitching, have a higher BMD than the nondominant limb.
Conversely, bones of a limb immobilized for several weeks or months had a lower BMD than in the contralateral, nonimmobilized limb.
Retrospective studies, in which adults were asked about their PA during childhood, suggest that women who had been physically active during childhood had a higher BMD i n the third and fourth decades of life than women who had been less active as children.
Longitudinal results of weight-bearing training programs are equivocal.
Most controlled interventions yielded little or no increase in BMD or bone mass of exercising adolescents (e.g., Blimkie et al., 1993).
CA RRYO VER T O A D ULT LIFE There are several models that may explain a possible link between an adult person's health and her or his activity behavior in earlier years.
As suggested by Blair et al. (1989) there are conceivably three avenues by which an enhanced PA level during childhood might improve adult health: 1 .
Childhood activity improves child health which, in turn, is beneficial to adult health.
2 .
An active lifestyle during childhood has a direct benefit to health in later years.
3 .
An active child becomes an active adult who, in turn, has a lower risk for disease than a n inactive adult.
Research provides no proof, or disproof, for any of these links.
However, because a sedentary lifestyle in adults has been proven to entail a high risk for several chronic diseases (Bouchard et al., 1994), the most plausible link is that an active lifestyle during childhood and adolescence would be carried over through adulthood which, in turn, would reduce risk f o r disease.
There are, however, no prospective studies that have tracked activity patterns from childhood to adulthood.
Even though activity patterns and attitudes toward PA remain quite stable during late adolescence (but less so around age 10Â­12 years) (Malina, 1990), there is a low relationship between the two.
HO W M UCH P HYSI CAL ACT I VIT Y? There are practically no data as to the optimal dose of PA during childhood and adolescence that might maintain and/or enhance health.
However, a group of experts from various countries has recently generated a consensus statement (Sallis 
All adolescents should be physically active daily, or nearly every day, as part of play, games, sports, work, transportation, recreation, physical education, or planned exercise; i n the context of family, school, and community activities.
2 .
Adolescents should engage in three or more sessions per week of activities that last 2 0 minutes or more at a time and that require moderate to vigorous levels of exertion.
There is no formal consensus statement for preadolescents although Corbin, Pangrazi, and Welk (1994) have made recommendations for physical activity levels for this group in a previous issue of the President's Council on Physical Fitness and Sports Physical Activity and Fitness Research Digest.

C ON CL US IO N Based on current information, no long-term studies exist that support or reject the notion that physical activity during childhood and adolescence is beneficial to adult health.
There is, however, some evidence for short-term benefits of enhanced PA during the early years, particularly among children and youth who are at a high risk for chronic illness in later years.
Much more research is needed to study this important issue further.
In particular, it is essential to identify means of keeping young people motivated to maintain an active lifestyle as they reach young adulthood and middle age.
