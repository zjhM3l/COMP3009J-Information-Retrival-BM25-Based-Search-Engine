Since 1996, HUD has been working in partnership SUMMARY DEPARTMENT OF THE INTERIOR Fish and Wildlife Service Notice of Availability of a Technical/ Agency Draft Multi-Species Recovery Plan for the Threatened and Endangered Species of South Florida : Fish and Wildlife Service, Interior.
ACTION: Notice of document availability and public comment period.
AGENCY : The Fish and Wildlife Service (Service) announces the availability for public review of Volume II of a twovolume draft multi-species recovery plan for the threatened and endangered species of South Florida and the ecosystems upon which they depend.
Volume II provides an ecosystem approach toward restoration of the South Florida Ecosystem, and discusses the biological composition, status, trends, management, and restoration needs of 23 major ecological communities in this region.
This volume integrates the needs for species of concern in addition to the federally listed species discussed in Volume I.
A notice announcing the availability of Volume I was published in the Federal Register on March 6, 1998 (63 FR 11304).
The Service solicits review and comments from the public on Volume II of the draft recovery plan.
DATES: Comments on the draft recovery plan must be received on or before September 30, 1998, to ensure consideration by the Service.
SUMMARY Federal Register / Vol. 63, No. 133 / Monday, July 13, 1998 / Notices Copies of the draft recovery plan can be obtained by contacting the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service Publications Unit, National Conservation Training Center, c/o Aramark, Rt. 1 Box 166, Shepherd Grade Rd., Shepherdstown, West Virginia 25443.
The Service is encouraging that requests for copies be for the CDROM version as the hard copy encompasses approximately 850 pages.
Additionally, this document may be viewed or downloaded from the Service's South Florida Ecological Service's Field Office website at: http://www.fws.gov/r4eao/ esvb.htm.
Written comments and materials regarding the plan should be addressed to Dawn Jennings, South Florida Field Office, 1360 U.S. Highway 1, Suite 5, Vero Beach, Florida 32960.
Comments and materials received are available on request for public inspection, by appointment, during normal business hours at the South Florida Field Office.
FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Dawn Jennings at the South Florida Field Office (561) 5623909 for information on the recovery plan; the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service Publications Unit (304) 8767203 for ADDRESSES: 37585 additional copies of the draft recovery plan.
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Background Restoring endangered or threatened animals and plants to the point where they are again secure, self-sustaining members of their ecosystems is a primary goal of the Fish and Wildlife Service's threatened and endangered species program.
To help guide the recovery effort, the Service prepares recovery plans for most of the listed species native to the United States.
Recovery plans describe actions that may be necessary for conservation of these species, establish criteria for the recovery levels for reclassification from endangered to threatened status or removal from the list, and estimate the time and cost for implementing the needed recovery measures.
The Endangered Species Act of 1973 (Act), as amended (16 U.S.C. et seq.) requires the development of recovery plans for listed species unless such a plan would not promote the conservation of a particular species.
Section 4(f) of the Act requires that public notice and an opportunity for public review and comment be provided during the recovery plan development.
The Service will consider all information presented during a public comment period prior to approval of each new or revised recovery plan.
The Service and other Federal agencies will take these comments into account in the course of implementing approved recovery plans.
The Multi-Species Recovery Plan identifies the recovery and restoration needs of 68 threatened and endangered species and their habitats in the South Florida Ecosystem--an area encompassing 67,346 square kilometers covering the 19 southernmost counties in Florida, using an ecosystem-wide approach.
The species addressed in this plan are found throughout South Florida.
Some are endemic to this area, others range outside of South Florida, and some of the species included in this plan migrate through or winter in South Florida.
These species use every vegetative, terrestrial, and aquatic community present in South Florida.
The status of these species varies, although very few show an increasing trend.

The Service has completed recovery plans for many of these species at various times between 1980 and 1996 to identify actions necessary to effect recovery.
The ivory-billed woodpecker, Bachman's warbler, silver rice rat, Key Largo woodrat, Key Largo cotton mouse, and Okeechobee gourd do not have approved recovery plans.
Since the approval of many of the recovery plans for South Florida species, identified tasks have been completed, and new information has become available on the biology, distribution, life history, and needs of these species.
In addition, some species with a South Florida population had no tasks identified for recovery in this area.
This plan updates some existing recovery plans, serves as the recovery plan for other species, or identifies South Florida's contribution to recovery.
The plan also addresses new threats and needs for all the species identified within it.
This plan is a two- volume effort to identify recovery needs of the species of South Florida and the ecosystems upon which they depend.
The focus of Volume I is the individual species, while Volume II integrates the species needs with those of the ecological communities in which they reside.

ACTION: Notice of a temporary closure to off highway vehicle use for portions of the Moquith Mountain Wilderness Study Area including the Coral Pink Sand Dunes.
AGENCY SUMMARY: This notice closes to off highway vehicle (OHV) use approximately 14,140 acres of the Moquith Mountain Wilderness Study Area (WSA) including some 800 acres within the Coral Pink Sand Dunes.
Areas within the WSA that will remain open to vehicle use include designated routes within closed areas and approximately 700 acres within the Coral Pink Sand Dunes.
OHV access to the open portion of the dunes will be provided by three designated access routes.
Five designated routes within the non sand dune portion of the WAS on Moquith Mountain will also remain open.
Temporary fencing and signing will be used as necessary to facilitate this action.
The authority for this action is 43 CFR 8341.2.
DATES: This closure will begin immediately and remain in effect pending amendment of the Vermilion Land Use Plan, which is expected to be completed by the end of April 1999.
ADDRESSES: Copies of maps are available at the Bureau of Land Management (BLM), Kanab Area Field Office, 318 North First East, Kanab, Utah 84741 and BLM Utah State Office, 324 South State Street, P.O. Box 45155, Salt Lake City, Utah 841450155.
FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Verlin Smith, Kanab Area Field Office, at (435) 6442672, ext. 2646 or Ronald Bolander, BLM, Utah State Office, at (801) 5394065.
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: The 14,830-acre Moquith Mountain WSA was established in 1980 and includes the northern segment of the Coral Pink Sand Dunes (about 1,500 acres).
The remaining 2,000 acres of the dunes are part of the Coral Pink Sand Dunes State Park which was established in 1963.
The sand dunes are a historic and popular OHV and other recreational use area.
Most of the WSA is currently designated as open to OHV use as documented in the Vermilion Management Framework Plan, completed in 1981.
In 1994, BLM implemented management actions through the Moquith Mountain WSA Management Guidance and Schedule (Guidance) to protect wilderness resource values.
In 1998, an interdisciplinary team was established to review the effectiveness of the Guidance and determine if impairment of wilderness values was occurring.
BLM policy allows for an open OHV category in sand dune areas as long as impairment of wilderness suitability does not occur.
The team determined that no impairment of wilderness values is occurring on the majority of the dunes.
However, impairment is occurring in peripheral areas of the northern portion of the dunes where vegetation is more prevalent.
Therefore, BLM is temporarily closing to OHV use the sand dunes north and west of an existing allotment fence with the exception of a portion of a dry lake bed and designated OHV access routes which will remain open.
The three designated OHV access routes are located as follows: (1) Sand Spring; (2) the dry lake bed east of the Yellowjacket Road and, (3) the Hancock Road near the Ponderosa Grove Campground.
BLM is also concerned that vehicle routes may be forming in other portions of the WSA.
Therefore, the non sand dune portion of the WSA will also be temporarily closed with the exception of the following designated routes that will remain open: the Sand Spring Road, South Fork Indian Canyon Petroglyph Road, the Moquith Mountain Loop, Hell Drive and Lamb's Point routes.
