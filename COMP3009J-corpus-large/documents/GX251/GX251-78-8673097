FEATURE ARTICLE
Archaeology Month Keynote Talk: Dillehay Lecture in Casper Highlights Wyoming Archaeology Awareness Month, 1998
The lecture given by Dr. Tom Dillehay, Professor of Anthropology at the University of Kentucky and noted South American researcher, on September 19 highlighted the 1998 Wyoming Archaeology Awareness Month activities.
Dillehay presented a synthesis of a linguistic, biological, and archaeological data from South America relevant to the pre-Clovis/Clovis-first debate to an audience of over 100 people at Casper College.
Dillehay's 20-year long research program at the Monte Verde site in southern Chile is leading to the acceptance of a pre-Clovis occupation of the Americas.
Excavations at the site have documented the remains of at least one tent covered by mastodon hides, hearths, a variety of stone and bone tools, and a suite of over 30 radiocarbon dates - all clustering around 12,500 B.P.
Besides Monte Verde, there are numerous other South American sites with radiocarbon dates contemporaneous with or slightly older than Clovis in North America.
These suggest that it would have been impossible for the mammoth hunters of the Great Plains to have been the founding population for the South American sites.
Human remains from eastern Brazil also suggest very early occupation, and some linguists are suggesting dates of around 40,000 B.P. to account for linguistic diversity.
Dillehay tentatively suggests dates for early Americans between 14,000 and 18,000 B.P. to account for the cultural complexity and early domesticates found in South American sites.
There are also hints at Monte Verde of an even older occupation, perhaps as much as 32,000 B.P.
The cultural context of these materials has yet to be conclusively demonstrated.
The Wyoming Archaeological Society hosted a reception for Dr. Dillehay and the public after the lecture, providing an opportunity for questions and continued discussion.
The lecture was funded by the Wyoming Council for the Humanities.

AGENCY UPDATES
Bureau of Land Management, Wyoming State Office
Since the BLM's National Programmatic Agreement was signed in May of 1997, nine BLM State Offices, including Wyoming, have developed State Protocol Agreements with their respective SHPOs.
The Protocols describe new partnering relationships between SHPOs and BLM and specify how SHPO and BLM will interact and cooperate with each other under the National Programmatic Agreement.
Wyoming's Protocol was signed on April 15, 1998, and coincided with an orientation training for BLM cultural specialists, BLM managers, and SHPO staff.
While the Protocol has been operating quite successfully during this past field season, there are a number of BLM operational procedures which still need to be defined or clarified.
Under the Protocol, these procedures are to be elucidated in a BLM Handbook which is to be developed jointly between BLM and SHPO.
Specific items which the Protocol states will be addressed are general BLM field procedures, procedures for dealing with discovery situations, NAGPRA procedures, identification and evaluation procedures, and project segmentation and notification procedures.
Other elements will likely include standards and guidelines for testing sites, cultural resource considerations for land transfers (exchanges and sales), and Section 106 compliance procedures for geophysical operations.
Anyone who would like to ensure that specific items are addressed in the BLM Handbook may express their interests or concerns.
While the Handbook will be designed to provide policy and guidance to both BLM field specialists and managers, there is also a recognized need to provide more guidance to cultural resource use permittees and CRM consultants.
Therefore, BLM is also considering developing a CRM Consultant's Handbook specifically for contract archaeologists/consultants working on BLM lands in Wyoming.

There were several important research projects in the Green River Resource Area this summer.
Dr. Robert Kelly, University of Wyoming, conducted test excavations at the Pine Springs site aimed at verifying the stratigraphic record reported by Floyd Sharrock and others form the University of Utah in the 1960s.
Kelly found that much of the site was apparently destroyed by Sharrock's excavations and subsequent looting of the site.
However, an area of what looks like intact deposits was located which may enable Kelly to ascertain whether or not the three components reported by Sharrock are accurate.
If so, Kelly intends to re-analyze the curated materials from Pine Springs.
Cursory inspection of the faunal materials indicates the presence of bison, mountain sheep, and camel.
Kelly is especially interested in establishing a better date for the lowest component at Pine Springs where camel bone was found.
He anticipates working more at Pine Springs next summer.
Pine Springs is south of Green River and west of Flaming Gorge Reservoir
.
UW Emeritus Professor George Frison conducted test excavations at the Krmpotich site north of Rock Springs.
This year's work indicates that the Krmpotich site contains a well-preserved Folsom component buried about 2 meters deep within stabilized dunes in the greater Killpecker Sand Dune field.
Apparently, several channel flakes have been found as well as numerous lithic tools, but no Folsom points yet.
The site is within an area where several other ages of Paleoindian points have been found, e.g., Goshen, Agate Basin, Eden.
The Krmpotich site is within about 3 miles of the Finley site which is the "type" site for the Eden Point (aka Yuma Point).
Frison anticipates conducting more work at the site next year.
Bureau of Land Management, Lander Field Office
In August and September of 1998, Danny Walker of the State Archeologist's Office headed up a remote sensing and excavation project on site 48FR3023, the Sand Draw Landfill Site, a campsite on highlands overlooking the Beaver Creek Valley, south of Riverton.
Magnetometer work was done over the site area to gather anomalies that could indicate where features were located.
Following the magnetometer survey, the results were analyzed and excavation areas were plotted.
Following the excavations, it appears the magnetometer data was of limited success in locating prehistoric features.
This could be from several factors, including not filtering the data the correct way.
The report writing on the excavations is in progress now.
Preliminary indications show that the excavations discovered two primary feature areas.
The most exciting one was a prepared shallow basined floor that had some basin features around and in it, plus two large roasting pit features in the floor.
These pits were very large (both about 50 cm in diameter, and 1+ meters deep).
From their flat bottoms, they contained large charcoal pieces in black soil, covered by large and numerous rocks.
Above the rocks, the pits were filled with very black charcoal stained soils to the tops of the pits.
Dates on both roasting pits were in the 900-1,000 B.P. range.
Preliminary floral analysis shows prickly pear remains are most abundant.
Unexpectedly, pine needle remains were also found in the samples.
This feature type has been seen in other parts of the Beaver Creek valley and is similar to features found in the Green River Basin as well.
The dates from these similar features have clustered around 900-1,500 B.P. and seem to indicate a distinct cultural activity/tradition during that period of time.
The other feature type was a series of shallow basin features and post molds (?) that indicate the presence of a pole structure.
This feature had few other remains with it and was younger than the floor/roasting pit feature.

CONTRACTOR JOURNAL
Office of the Wyoming State Archaeologist
Copies of the Office of the Wyoming State Archaeologist (OWSA), Survey Section's 1997 investigation in Yellowstone National Park are available.
This report documents the results of the surface collections and test excavations conducted at nine prehistoric sites in the northern part of the Park in 1997.
Most of the sites are located north of Obsidian Cliff and consist of lithic workshops for the reduction of the locally available obsidian.
Although no radiocarbon dates were obtained, diagnostic artifacts suggest most of the activity was related to Late Archaic (Pelican Lake) occupations.
The base of a probable late Paleoindian point made from Lava Creek Tuff and Late Prehistoric points were also obtained from the sites.
Interestingly, the last half of the Late Archaic coincides with the use of Yellowstone and Bear Gulch/Dry Camas Creek obsidians in Middle Woodland Hopewellian sites in the Midwest; a topic that is discussed at some length within this report entitled The 1997 Archaeological Investigation of Nine Prehistoric Sites in the Northern Portion of Yellowstone National Park, Wyoming, Projects 254E, 254F, and 785F, by Paul H. Sanders
Brian Waitkus is continuing to excavate 48AB1 just off U.S. Highway 34 in Sybille Canyon.
Last year's 61-square meter excavation of the Early Archaic component yielded three intermittent stained levels associated with eight features, ranging in age from 6,900-7,300 B.P. Discrete activity areas were identified, some of which contained large side-notched projectile points, bifaces, debitage, and faunal remains.
The latter include deer/sheep, bird, and rabbit bone.
This year's excavation is focusing on a Paleoindian level that is more than 1 m below the Early Archaic component.
So far, a complete Midland-like point, scattered flakes, and tools have been recovered.
Some bison and deer/antelope/sheep-sized faunal remains have also been obtained.
Excavations are expected to continue into the fall, and anyone interested in seeing the site and its elaborate drainage system (necessary to excavate below the water table) is encouraged to visit.
Dan Eakin reports that fourteen seasons of archaeological investigations on the North Fork of the Shoshone River within the Shoshone National Forest have now been completed.
The work was performed for the Wyoming Department of Transportation (WYDOT) in anticipation of the road reconstruction work now underway within the Shoshone National Forest.
Of the many contributions that the research has already made, two are particularly noteworthy.
The first is information recovered from the Goff Creek site (48PA325) which is located at the mouths of both Goff and Fishhawk Creeks, about 10 miles east of the East Gate of Yellowstone National Park.
The Goff Creek site is located both on an alluvial fan constructed by Goff Creek and on a Shoshone River terrace.
Radiocarbon dates as young as 600 B.P. and as old as 7,000 B.P., along with Paleoindian projectile points resembling both Barton Gulch and Cody Complex types, document long-term use of this area as a campsite.
Considerable time depth for the use of bighorn sheep is also suggested by the identified faunal remains.
In one part of the site, Early Archaic and Paleoindian materials were recovered from well-preserved levels that had been buried by alluvial cobbles initially mistaken for Late Pleistocene channel deposits and therefore the geologic cutoff-point for excavation.
Nearly all diagnostic projectile point styles found at the site are represented at Mummy Cave, which is only a few miles down river.
The second contribution is a result of collaboration of OWSA and Mr. Bill Eckerle of Western GeoArch Research in Salt Lake City, Utah.
This involved identification and classification of landforms in the valley and the timing of human use of these landforms.
Radiocarbon-dated paleosols and charcoal from fire hearths have provided firm age brackets for the Holocene river terraces and the many alluvial fans associated with tributary streams.
Together, these indicate that, in the North Fork Valley, the last three-fourths of Holocene time is represented in a single terrace, and as-yet undiscovered pre-10,000 year old Paleoindian occupations are probably limited to surfaces located above the overbank limit of 10,000 years ago.
Since 1991, Dave Reiss has supervised a number of Class III surveys for the Wyoming Army National Guard training areas near Guernsey.
Some 30,000 acres were inventoried and over 700 sites recorded.
The surface inventories found diagnostic artifacts ranging from Paleoindian through Protohistoric periods.
The majority of these artifacts were from the Late Archaic and Late Prehistoric periods.
We are working with the National Guard and Mary Hopkins of SHPO to get these sites into the GIS system.
While the Hartville Uplift is well-known for the prehistoric quarries, the survey data indicate there are many long-term camps with stone circles and high diversities of tool types.
This summer (1998), 18 sites were formally tested.
Several fire hearths from different sites were excavated, and dates obtained ranged from 260 B.P. to 1,800 B.P.
The majority of the dates cluster around 1,000 B.P., based on a sample of only 10 radiocarbon dates.
Besides the usual types of artifacts found on sites, we did find what we think is the remains of a sauger (fish) in one of the fire hearths.
Depending on funding, we will be testing more sites next summer.
