Appeal No. 97-0642 Application 08/242,318 This is a decision on appeal under 35 U.S.C. Â§ 134 from the final rejection of claims 1-37.
We affirm-in-part.
BACKGROUND The disclosed invention is directed to conversion of text from one "text domain" to another "text domain" using a "conversion gesture" in a stylus-based computer system.
Claim 1 is reproduced below.
1.
A method of converting characters from one text domain to another text domain in a stylus-based computer in which information may be entered by interaction of a stylus with a display screen, the method comprising the following steps: (a) identifying text that has been selected on the display screen; (b) determining whether the stylus has been used to enter a conversion gesture for converting the selected text on the display screen from a source text domain to a destination text domain; (c) determining the source text domain of the selected text; (d) determining an appropriate destination text domain to which the selected text is to be converted; and (e) replacing at least a portion of the selected text on the display screen with text from the destination text domain determined in step d.
The Examiner relies on the following prior art: -2-

We refer to the Final Rejection (Paper No. 8) (pages referred to as "FR__") and the Examiner's Answer (Paper No. 15) (pages referred to as "EA__") for a statement of the Examiner's position and to the Substitute Appeal Brief (Paper No. 14) (pages referred to as "Br__") for Appellant's arguments thereagainst.
We assume for this appeal that the rejection should be claims 24-27 because only claims 24-27 are discussed in the statement of the rejection in the Final Rejection and the Examiner's Answer and because Capps is additionally relied on for the rejection of claims 28-37.

This ground of rejection at pages 28-37 of the Final Rejection, is not mentioned or addressed in Appellant's Brief.
Nevertheless, we have considered the rejection on the merits.

Appeal No. 97-0642 Application 08/242,318 OPINION 35 U.S.C. Â§ 112, second paragraph The Examiner considers the phrase "text extension" to be vague and indefinite "because it is unclear how text is considered extended when the claim language indicates conversion" (FR2).
Appellant argues that "extensions" are
defined in the art as "small files that temporarily become part of the system software" and "[a]s noted in the specification, the text extension system manages multiple 'extensions' each of which 'acts as a filter which controls the conversion of text from one text domain to another'" (Br7).
In any case, Appellant argues, an applicant is
entitled to be his own lexicographer.
We agree with Appellant.
The phrase "text extension"
does not imply text is "extended" in some way as the Examiner states.
The term "text extension system" is consistent with
the description in the specification at page 17 as controlling the conversion of text from one text domain to another.

Grouping of claims Inasmuch as the Examiner's statement of the rejection appears to err in including claims 28-37 in the rejection over Sklarew, Horodeck, and Kato (Appellant's Issue E), and since Appellant does not mention the rejection of claims 28-37 over Sklarew, Horodeck, Kato, and Capps (which would be Issue F), -6-
Appeal No. 97-0642 Application 08/242,318 we summarize the grouping of claims as follows using Appellant's issue letters from the Brief: Issue B.
In the rejection of claims 1-7 over Sklarew and
Kato, claims 1-6 stand or fall together and claim 7 stands or falls separately.
Issue C.
In the rejection of claims 8-20 over Sklarew,
Kato, and Capps, claim 10 stands or falls with independent claim 1 because it has not been separately argued; claims 8, 9, and 16-18 stand or fall as one group; and claims 10-15, 19, and 20 stand or fall together as another group.
Issue D.
In the rejection of claims 21-23 over Capps and
Kato, claims 21-23 stand or fall together.
Issue E.
In the rejection of claims 24-37, which we
treat as a rejection of claims 24-27, over Sklarew, Horodeck, and Kato, claims 24-26 stand or fall together and claim 27 stands or falls separately.
[Issue F.]
In the rejection of claims 28-37 over Sklarew, Horodeck, Kato, and Capps, claim 30 stands or falls with independent claim 24 because it has not been separately argued; claims 28 and 29 stand or fall as one group; and claims 31-37 stand or fall together as another group.

Appeal No. 97-0642 Application 08/242,318
Issue B:
Claims 1-7
Claims 1-6 Initially, we must interpret what is meant by "text domain" with a view to determining whether Sklarew's handwritten characters can be a "source text domain" and Sklarew's computer text font symbols can be a "destination text domain."
The specification defines "text domain" in one place as follows (specification, page 4, lines 5-7): "The 'text
domain' referred to herein may be a particular 'character set' such as the Greek or Roman alphabets, or the Kanji characters."
The specification also states (specification,
page 13, lines 21-26): As used herein, the phrase "text domain" refers to a group of textual elements associated with a single language.
The textual elements may be character sets or word lists used in a language.
A word list may be provided as a dictionary or collection of dictionaries of words belonging to a particular language.
A character set is a collection of characters that are used together in a language, as in the example of an alphabet.
These definitions do not require the language or alphabet associated with the source group of textual elements be different from the language or alphabet associated with the -8-
Appeal No. 97-0642 Application 08/242,318 destination group of textual elements; that is, there may be many text domains that map to the same language.
While an
alphabet is given as an example of a character set, a character set is not limited to an alphabet.
Handwritten
characters form a "character set[] . . . used in a language" and computer text font symbols form a different "character set[]
Therefore, in our opinion,
the claim limitation of converting "from a source text domain to a destination text domain" includes converting from a handwritten character set "source text domain" to a computer text font symbol character set "destination text domain."
Appellant is capable of expressing that the source and destination text domains "specify words in different alphabets," as recited in claims 24 and 31, and could expressly recite that the source and destination text domains correspond to textual elements, words or character sets, in different languages if that interpretation is meant.
See
In re Zletz, 893 F.2d 319, 321-22, 13 USPQ2d 1320, 1322 (Fed.
Cir. 1989) (claims are given their broadest reasonable interpretation during examination: "The reason is simply that
during patent prosecution when claims can be amended, -9-
Appeal No. 97-0642 Application 08/242,318 ambiguities should be recognized, scope and breadth of language explored, and clarification imposed.").
Sklarew discloses a stylus-based computer which recognizes "handwritten symbols" (defined at col. 4, lines 15-25) and converts them to computer recognized "font symbols" (defined at col. 4, lines 26-35) and, if desired, executes "editing functions" (defined at col. 4, lines 44-48) pursuant to "editing symbols" (defined at col. 4, lines 36-43).
The computer stores a suitable array of font
symbols for conversion of the handwritten symbols and different sets of font symbols for different languages and symbologies may be created and stored in memory (col. 11, lines 37-51).
So-called "softkeys" on the display can be
actuated by the stylus to cause a function to be performed (col. 12, lines 7-20).
"All documents can be stored, changed
and communicated in the manner in which these functions are accomplished on a conventional word processing system with the difference that these functions are accomplished with handwritten Editing Symbols on the (optional) screen or by touching the Softkeys with the stylus." lines 47-53.)
(Col. 10,
Of particular importance, figure 12D shows that - 10 -
Appeal No. 97-0642 Application 08/242,318 the user presses the "MATCH" (misspelled as "HATCH") softkey, which causes the computer to convert the handwritten input to the corresponding font symbols as shown in figure 12E (col. 12, lines 41-63).
Kato relates to a scanning-type full text search method and system.
"More in particular, it relates to a document
search method and apparatus suitable for preventing omission in search caused by differences in synonyms and notations at the time of searching using non-controlled key words (called free words)."
(Col. 1, lines 10-15.)
Figure 9 shows a
standardizing process in which a plurality of notations are collected into one, e.g., "a search term written in romaji or katakana is once converted into a term written in katakana by a standard notation" (col. 6, lines 7-9) and "[o]n the other hand, a search term written in alphabets is generalized to expression in katakana by borrowed word/kana conversion" (col. 6, lines 12-14).
After forming the synonyms, the terms
are subjected to different kinds of conversion, such as kana/kanji conversion (col. 6, lines 15-23).
Appellant does
not dispute that Kato teaches conversion from one text domain
- 11 -
Appeal No. 97-0642 Application 08/242,318 (e.g., katakana) to a different text domain (e.g., kanji) (Br12).
The conversion in Kato is completely automatic.
Sklarew alone appears to meet the limitations of claim 1.
As discussed, handwritten characters are from "one text domain" (a "source text domain") and the font symbol characters are from "another text domain" (a "destination text domain").
The computer in Sklarew identifies text in a window
as being selected, e.g., the window shown in figure 12C.
While it is implied that Sklarew automatically converts handwriting as it is entered, Sklarew also discloses that conversion of the handwritten input to the corresponding font symbol may be initiated by pressing the "MATCH" softkey (misspelled as "HATCH" in figures 12D and 12E; col. 12, lines 41-63).
Sklarew discloses that editing "functions are
accomplished with handwritten Editing Symbols on the (optional) screen or by touching the Softkeys with the stylus" (col. 10, lines 50-53), where the editing symbols are editing "gestures."
This teaching would have suggested to one of
ordinary skill in the art of designing stylus-based interfaces that other functions, such as the conversion function, could be initiated by either a handwritten symbol (gesture) or a key - 12 -
Appeal No. 97-0642 Application 08/242,318 selection.
We conclude that it would have been obvious to use
a gesture to initiate the conversion process in Sklarew instead of a softkey selection.
The source text domain in
Sklarew is predetermined to be the set of handwritten symbols and the destination text domain to which the selected text is to be converted is the computer text font symbol set.
Claim 1
does not require automatic determination of a source text domain and an appropriate destination text domain from several choices.
The selected handwritten text is converted
(figures 12E and 12F) and replaced on the screen (figure 12G).
Therefore, Sklarew establishes a prima facie case of obviousness.
The Examiner applies Kato to show kana/kanji text domain conversion of the type disclosed by Appellant.
The Examiner
considers the motivation to combine Sklarew and Kato to be the fact that both deal with conversions (EA.).
We do not
consider this generalization to be sufficient motivation for one of ordinary skill in the art to apply the handwriting entry system of Sklarew to a symbology conversion system as taught by Kato, or, alternatively, to implement the automatic symbology conversion system used in full text searching in - 13 -
Appeal No. 97-0642 Application 08/242,318 Kato as a selective conversion system on a pen-based computer as taught by Sklarew.
It appears from our reading of the
rejection that the Examiner has found a pen-based computer and a kana/kanji conversion system and combined the teachings based on Appellant's disclosure rather than a teaching in the prior art.
While we do not find the motivation to combine
Kato, we consider Sklarew alone sufficient to establish a prima facie case of obviousness.
The Examiner states that Appellant's arguments have been addressed in the statement of the rejection (EA27).
However,
the statement of the rejection repeats the rejection from the Final Rejection (apparently verbatim) and does not specifically address the arguments.
This is not helpful to
Appellant or to this panel in trying to decide the merits of the rejections.
Appellant argues that "to the extent that Sklarew's handwriting recognition might be characterized as a 'conversion,' that conversion is not initiated by the user with any type of gesture" (Br15) because "the handwriting recognition process is executed automatically without the aid of a gesture or any other user intervention (see column 10, - 14 -
Appeal No. 97-0642 Application 08/242,318 line 8)" (Br15).
As discussed, supra, Sklarew discloses
initiating conversion by pressing the "MATCH" softkey (figures 12D and 12E; col. 12, lines 41-63) and discloses that editing functions can be performed either with a softkey or a gesture (col. 10, lines 47-53).
This would have suggested to
one of ordinary skill in the art of designing interfaces for pen-based computers that other functions, such as the conversion function, could be initiated by either a handwritten symbol (gesture) or a key selection.
In our
opinion, it would have been obvious to use a gesture to initiate the conversion process instead of a softkey selection in view of the teachings of Sklarew as a whole.
Appellant argues that Sklarew teaches only editing gestures (Br13).
This argument fails to account for what the
editing gestures would have suggested to one of ordinary skill in the art.
In our opinion, one of ordinary skill in the art
had sufficient knowledge and experience to recognize that stylus gestures could be used to initiate other functions and commands, such as a conversion function.
Appellant argues that "the Examiner's position seems to imply that the patent to Sklarew suggests using a pen gesture - 15 -
Appeal No. 97-0642 Application 08/242,318 to activate any and all computer functions that might be incorporated in a pen-based computer system" (Br13).
It is
argued that Sklarew discloses softkeys which can be used to enter computer commands with a non-gesture action and, "[t]hus, the mere existence of references showing pen-based computers which can recognize gestures, does not automatically suggest to one of skill in the art that implementing a text domain conversion on such computers would necessarily involve a pen-based gesture" (Br13).
There are a limited number of
ways for a user to enter data and commands in a pen-based system, e.g., a keyboard, softkeys, or gestures.
One of
ordinary skill in the art of designing interfaces for penbased computers would have considered any of these known methods, e.g., a gesture, to have been obvious.
The existence
of a limited choice of options does not make the selection of a particular option nonobvious.
Appellant argues that "Sklarew's handwriting recognition process involves text from only a single text domain" (Br15) and that "handwritten text and computer text from the same character set do not constitute separate source and destination text domains within the meaning of the claimed - 16 -
Appeal No. 97-0642 Application 08/242,318 invention" (Br16) because a "text domain" is a group of textual elements associated with a single language.
We
disagree with this narrow interpretation of what constitutes a "text domain" for the reasons discussed at the beginning of this subsection.
Appellant argues that there is no motivation to combine the respective teachings because Sklarew can access only a single text domain at one time (Br14).
As discussed, we agree
that the Examiner has failed to establish motivation to combine by a showing of facts in the references.
However, we
disagree with the argument that Sklarew involves only a single text domain for the reasons discussed at the beginning of this subsection.
For the reasons discussed above, Appellant has failed to rebut the prima facie case of obviousness with respect to claim 1.
The rejection of claims 1-6 is sustained.
Claim 7 Appellant argues that neither Sklarew nor Kato discloses identifying multiple potential text conversion results and then ranking them (Br16-17).
The Examiner finds that
searching for a minimum difference for recognition of the font - 17 -
Appeal No. 97-0642 Application 08/242,318 symbol or command, as described at column 17, lines 51-63, meets claim 7 (EA8).
Appellant argues that Sklarew merely
searches for the "best match" and does not perform any ranking before selecting the top ranked candidate (Br17).
with Appellant.
We agree
There is no suggestion of any "ranking" of A "best match" comparison
candidate text strings in Sklarew.
merely replaces the old best match with a new best match and does not retain the previous best matches in any sort of rank order.
Therefore, the rejection of claim 7 is reversed.
Claims 8-20
Issue C:
Claims 11-15, 19, and 20 As a matter of claim interpretation, claim 11 does not require that the recognizer produce a computer character from the handwritten character, which computer character is then converted to a second text domain; compare claim 11 to claim 24.
Therefore, we interpret claim 11 to cover
converting handwritten characters ("displayed characters of the first text domain," as claimed) to computer generated font symbols ("characters of the second text domain," as claimed) as disclosed in Sklarew.
The software in Sklarew which takes
the recognized character or command and converts it into the - 18 -
Appeal No. 97-0642 Application 08/242,318 computer text font symbol is a "text extension system."
We
conclude that a prima facie case of obviousness is established with respect to claim 11 for the reasons stated with respect to claim 1 and because Capps additionally discloses a correction gesture (col. 7, line 58, to col. 8, line 4), which provides further evidence that it would have been obvious to use gestures to initiate different functions in a pen-based computer interface.
Appellant argues that "[t]he text extension system includes 'extensions' (which were defined above) for converting between multiple text domains" (Br20) and that "Claim 12 explicitly requires that the 'text extension comprises one or more text extensions . . .'"
(Br20).
Appellant argues that "the cited art does not disclose or suggest the use or advantages of a text extension system with multiple text domain capabilities" (Br20) and that "[n]either the Sklarew, Capps et al., nor Kato et al. patents disclose or suggest a system which is capable of multiple conversions between multiple text domains" (Br20-21).
Claim 11 requires
only "a text extension system" and the "one or more" language of claim 12 is satisfied by a single text extension.
- 19 -
Appeal No. 97-0642 Application 08/242,318 Therefore, the arguments about the advantages of multiple text domain conversions are not commensurate in scope with the claims.
The claimed text extension system is for "converting
displayed characters of the first text domain to characters of the second text domain," which function is performed by software in Sklarew, and does not require any automatic determination of source and destination domains, nor does it imply that the advantages argued by Appellant (Br20) are inherent.
Appellant has failed to rebut the prima facie case.
rejection of claim 11 is sustained.
The
Dependent claims 12-15,
19, and 20 have not been separately argued and fall with claim 11.
Therefore, the rejection of claims 11-15, 19 and 20
is sustained.
Claims 8, 9, and 16-18 Claims 8 and 9 further limit claim 7.
Although the
rejection of claim 7 has been reversed, an additional reference to Capps is applied to claims 8 and 9.
Capps discloses a user interface for a pen-based computer for correcting handwriting recognition results.
The Capps
interface ranks a list of candidate words (text strings) and - 20 -
Appeal No. 97-0642 Application 08/242,318 allows the user to display and select from that list.
ranked candidate word can be designated to replace the selected text.
Thus, Capps discloses the ranking and Capps allows the selected The top
designation limitations of claim 7.
text string on the screen to be corrected using a correction gesture and a menu of candidate text strings as recited in claims 8 and 9.
It would have been obvious to apply the
correction technique of Capps to the pen-based computer of Sklarew because both deal with handwriting recognition in a pen-based computer.
The combination of Sklarew, Kato, and
Capps establishes a prima facie case of obviousness with respect to claims 8 and 9 and 16-18.
Appellant argues that in Capps "both the handwritten text and the listed candidates for recognition are from the same text domain" (Br18).
We conclude that handwriting symbols and
computer font symbols are broadly from different "text domains," as discussed in connection with claim 1.
Hence, we
conclude that Appellant has failed to rebut the prima facie
- 21 -
Appeal No. 97-0642 Application 08/242,318 case and the rejection of claims 8, 9, and 16-18 is sustained.
4
Claim 10 The separate patentability of claim 10 has not been argued.
Thus, claim 10 falls with claim 1.
We note, however,
that Capps teaches initiating a correction function using a conversion gesture (a double tap of the stylus on the screen) within a bounding box of the word object (col. 7, lines 62-65)).
Issue D: The rejection of claim 10 is sustained.
Claims 21-23
The Examiner has not established a prima facie case of obviousness with respect to claim 21.
As discussed in
connection with claim 1, we find no motivation in the record established by the Examiner to combine the automatic symbology conversion system of Kato with a pen-based handwriting recognition device as taught in Sklarew.
Capps discloses a
Since claim 7 has not been rejected over the combination including Capps, we have the somewhat unusual circumstance of the rejection of dependent claims 8 and 9 being affirmed (with an additional reference) and the rejection of the parent claim 7 being reversed.

- 22 -
Appeal No. 97-0642 Application 08/242,318 user interface for a pen-based computer similar to Sklarew for correcting handwriting recognition results and we likewise find no motivation in the record to combine Capps and with the automatic conversion system in Kato.
As discussed in
connection with the rejection of claim 1, handwritten characters can broadly be considered to be from "one text domain" (a "source text domain") and the font symbols can be considered to be from "another text domain" (a "destination text domain").
However, the Examiner does not rely on this
interpretation; the Examiner relies on the recognized word object (the word after it is recognized from the handwritten ink object) being in the source text domain.
The rejection is
based on the conclusion that it would have been obvious to convert between different symbology text domains as taught in Kato instead of correcting words in a single text domain as taught in Capps.
We do not find motivation for this
modification in the automatic symbology conversion in Kato or in the correction method in Capps.
The motivation derives The rejection

of claims 21-23 is reversed.
Issue E: Claims 24-37 [sic, 24-27] - 23 -
Appeal No. 97-0642 Application 08/242,318 Appellant argues that "it appears that the Horodeck reference adds nothing of relevance beyond that described in the Kato et al. reference" (Br23).
We disagree.
Kato is
directed to automatic symbology conversion used in full text searching and has no teaching of a user manually designating text to be converted from one text domain to another.
As a
consequence, we found no motivation for one of ordinary skill in the art to adapt this automatic conversion in a search method to a pen-based computer such as Sklarew.
Horodeck,
however, discloses a computer with a keyboard for performing text domain conversions wherein delimiters are inserted by the operator to designate portions of text to be converted from one text domain to another.
The computer responds to the pair
of delimiting signals to convert from kana to kanji (e.g., col. 15, lines 33-45).
Horodeck also discloses that a list
(i.e., menu) of numbered choices is displayed in the assembly portion of the cathode ray tube when the kana/kanji conversion results in ambiguities (e.g., col. 15 under heading "MANUAL RESOLUTION OF AMBIGUITIES").
Therefore, Horodeck discloses
manually selecting text to be converted, determining the appropriate destination text domain, displaying a list of - 24 -
Appeal No. 97-0642 Application 08/242,318 candidate text strings for ambiguous conversions, and selecting from the list.
Claims 24-26 Horodeck discloses conversion of text domains, but does not disclose a pen-based computer system with handwritten character input and conversion in response to a conversion gesture.
It is admitted that it was known to use Japanese
handwriting recognition to enter characters (specification, page 3).
Sklarew discloses that "the keyboardless computer
can function in any application or environment in which handwritten input translated into computer text is useful or necessary" (col. 11, lines 1-4) and it has particular utility for word processing and communication in "languages which are not made up of a small or limited set of alphanumeric characters (e.g., Japanese, Korean, and Chinese" (col. 11, lines 10-13).
In our opinion, one skilled in the art of
converting text from one text domain to another, such art being represented by Horodeck, would have been motivated to use a pen-based computer character recognition input, such as Sklarew, because it is suited for handwritten input of complicated characters.
One of ordinary skill in the art - 25 -
Appeal No. 97-0642 Application 08/242,318 would have been motivated to implement the conversion features of Horodeck using known techniques of pen-based interfaces as taught by Sklarew.
As noted by the Examiner (EA17), Sklarew
discloses that user defined delimiters can be used to identify portions of text to be moved (col. 10, lines 38-42), which reasonably would have suggested to one skilled in the art that the keyboard-entered delimiters in Horodeck could be replaced by stylus-entered delimiters to identify text to be converted.
Sklarew discloses using a softkey or a gesture to initiate a function, which would have suggested to one skilled in the art that a gesture could be used to initiate other functions, such as conversion.
In our opinion, the combination of Sklarew and
Horodeck establishes a prima facie case of obviousness.
Appellant argues that the rejection should be overturned for the reasons stated in Argument Section B (Br22).
We refer
to our discussion of the arguments with respect to claim 1.
In addition, we note that Horodeck discloses the same kind of text domain conversion as disclosed by Appellant.
Appellant also argues that step (f) of claim 24 requires that "the source and destination text domains specify words in
- 26 -
Appeal No. 97-0642 Application 08/242,318 different alphabets."
Horodeck expressly discloses conversion
of words in different symbologies.
Appellant has failed to rebut the prima facie case of obviousness with respect to claim 24.
claims 24-26 is sustained.
Claim 27 Claim 27 is similar to claim 7.

a list of numbered choices is displayed in the assembly portion of the cathode ray tube when the kana/kanji conversion results in ambiguities (e.g., col. 15 under heading "MANUAL RESOLUTION OF AMBIGUITIES").
This list is broadly considered
a "ranking" of the candidate text strings because claim 27 does not define what criteria are used to place the text strings in any sort of order.
The combination of Sklarew and
Horodeck establishes a prima facie case of obviousness.
Appellant relies on the arguments made with respect to claim 7.
Appellant argues that "[n]one of these patents [to
Sklarew, Kato, or Horodeck] describes identifying multiple potential text conversion results and then ranking them" (Br24).
We disagree because of the teaching in Horodeck,
which has not been addressed by Appellant.

Thus, a prima facie case of
obviousness is established with respect to claims 28 and 29.
We disagree with Appellant's argument that Horodeck does not suggest ranking (Br24).
Appellant has failed to rebut the
prima facie case of obviousness with respect to claims 28 and 29.
The rejection of claims 28 and 29 is sustained.
Claim 30 Claim 30 is similar to claim 10.
The separate
patentability of claim 30 has not been argued; thus, claim 30 falls with claim 24.
As noted with respect to claim 10, Capps

Claims 31-37 Claim 31 is identical to claim 11 except that it adds the phrase "wherein the first and second text domains specify words in different alphabets."
Horodeck discloses conversion The
of text domains which specify words in different alphabets, but does not disclose a stylus-based computer system with handwritten character input and conversion in response to a conversion gesture.
In our opinion, it would have been
obvious to recognize handwritten characters and convert them from one text domain to a different text domain in the pen-based computer of Sklarew for the reasons stated in connection with claim 24.
The "text extension system for
converting displayed characters of the first text domain to characters of the second text domain" is met by the conversion software in Horodeck.
In our opinion, the combination
establishes a prima facie case of obviousness.
Appellant argues that "Horodeck merely teach[es] conversions between one set of text domains" (Br23) and that - 29 -
