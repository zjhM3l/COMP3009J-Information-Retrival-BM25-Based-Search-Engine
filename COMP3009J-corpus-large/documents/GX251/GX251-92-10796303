Artery/Third Harbor Tunnel Project Oversight Coordination Commission Commission Summary Report July 1998 Contents Background The Oversight Coordination Commission Summary of Work Conclusion _________________________________________________________________ BACKGROUND THE CENTRAL ARTERY/THIRD HARBOR TUNNEL (CA/T) PROJECT LEGISLATIVE HISTORY THE COMMISSION THE SUPPLEMENTAL PLAN THE CENTRAL ARTERY/ THIRD HARBOR TUNNEL PROJECT The information in this section was drawn from several sources, including the CA/T Project, and has not necessarily been verified by the Commission.
The Central Artery/Third Harbor Tunnel (CA/T) Project is the largest, most complex, and technologically most challenging highway project in the history of the United States.
It will replace Boston's deteriorating elevated Central Artery (I-93) with a modern underground expressway, and will extend the Massachusetts Turnpike (I-90) (Turnpike) to Logan Airport via the Ted Williams Tunnel under Boston Harbor.
The massive project is designed to improve traffic flow and safety in one of America's oldest and most congested cities, and will also promote economic development in the region.
To construct the CA/T Project through the heart of a major city will require a series of state-of-the-art engineering feats that will allow construction to continue within a few feet of active subway tunnels, railroad tracks, office towers, and historic buildings.
The CA/T Project will be built while simultaneously ensuring the free flow of traffic in downtown Boston during more than a decade of construction.
For example, the elevated highway will remain in service while the new highway is being built directly underneath.
The CA/T Project consists of approximately 7.5 miles of urban highway, tunnels, bridges, viaducts, and surface streets, as well as project-related buildings.
Construction extends from the I-93 Massachusetts Avenue Interchange on the south to Charlestown's Sullivan Square on the north, and from the Turnpike interchange by the Fort Point Channel on the west under Boston Harbor to Logan Airport and Route 1A in East Boston.
The reconstruction of I-93 will provide eight traffic lanes in a tunnel section beneath the existing elevated highway within the downtown area.
The existing Central Artery will subsequently be demolished, permitting improvements to surface roadways and providing 27 acres of open space in the heart of the city.
The Turnpike extension includes a four-lane immersed tube tunnel under Boston Harbor, which is intended to alleviate congestion on I-93 by routing traffic travelling from the south and west directly to Logan Airport and Route 1A in East Boston.

In 1985, the Massachusetts Highway Department (MassHighway) hired the joint venture of Bechtel/Parsons Brinckerhoff (B/PB) to manage project design and construction activities.
B/PB has overall responsibility for project design, management, and interface coordination of all construction contracts.
MassHighway has paid or has budgeted more than $1.7 billion under its contractual arrangement with B/PB.
[1]
In 1989, the Project management estimated that construction would be completed in 1998 at a cost of $4.4 billion.
In March 1997, the Project management estimated that construction would be completed in 2004 at a cost of more than $10.8 billion, six years later and 145% more expensive than the 1989 estimate.
The United States General Accounting Office (GAO) reported in its July 1997 review of the CA/T Project, and confirmed in its February 1998 report, that the cost of the CA/T Project will likely exceed the current MassHighway estimate of $10.8 billion and could reach as high as $11.6 billion.
The $10.8 billion cost estimate includes a credit to the cost of the CA/T Project of about $800 million, which represents the future receipts of insurance proceeds.
The GAO also concluded that MassHighway's $10.8 billion cost estimate was based on aggressive cost containment goals, which would be difficult to achieve based on past performance.
The GAO estimated that the cost of completing the CA/T Project could increase between an additional $100 million and $500 million, if these goals were not achieved.
The GAO also reported that MassHighway's December 1996 feasibility study reflected a significant shortfall of between $1.8 billion and $2.3 billion in project funding, depending upon the federal funds provided.
To finance the shortfall, the Commonwealth intends to borrow approximately $2.1 billion through the issuance of Bond and Grant Anticipation Notes.
These notes will be repaid after federal and other funds are received
.
Until 1991, the Federal Interstate Highway Program was the primary source of the CA/T Project funding, reimbursing approximately 90% of the CA/T Project's construction costs.
Federal funding was continued at this level through the Intermodal Surface Transportation Efficiency Act of 1991 (ISTEA).
In 1998, as the CA/T Project enters its peak construction period, the federal funding formula has changed, and the Commonwealth will be expected to pay a much larger share of the cost for the remainder of the CA/T Project under the Transportation Equity Act for the 21^st Century (TEA-21).
For the period ending May 1998, the CA/T Project reports that it had awarded approximately $587 million in design contracts and $6.03 billion in construction contracts, and that work had been completed on approximately 97% of the design and 41% of the construction.
LEGISLATIVE HISTORY
The CA/T Project is an important transportation project and generally is viewed as an economic stimulus for the region.
Any excessive spending on the CA/T Project, however, results in fewer dollars for infrastructure needs in other parts of the Commonwealth.
The Legislature enacted Chapter 102 of the Acts of 1995, directing the State Auditor, the Inspector General, and the House and Senate Committees on Post Audit and Oversight to jointly prepare a comprehensive plan for oversight on the CA/T Project.
(See Appendix A for the text of Section 17 and Section 21 of Chapter 102 of the 1995 statute.)
The Attorney General was also included because of his crucial role in investigating and prosecuting civil and criminal cases of fraud and abuse.
The goals of the plan were to combine the expertise and statutory authority of the three offices to target management difficulties that invite waste, fraud, and abuse, to identify cost-savings, and to pursue enforcement and recoupment actions against those who may be engaged in fraudulent or otherwise unlawful activity.
Section 2B of Chapter 205 of the Acts of 1996 appropriated $2 million for the implementation of the comprehensive plan for oversight.
(See Appendix B for the text of this section of the 1996 statute.)
The funds could not be released until the Supplemental Plan (Plan) creating the Oversight Coordination Commission (Commission) for the CA/T Project was submitted to the Legislature.
The Plan was submitted in October 1996, and funds for the operation of the Commission became available on January 21, 1997.
THE COMMISSION
By creating and funding the Commission, the Legislature has taken a groundbreaking step in the realm of megaproject oversight.
The offices of the three public officials that constitute the Commission - the Attorney General, the State Auditor, and the Inspector General - differ in their statutory powers and expertise.
The Commission provides a forum in which the members work closely together to coordinate and combine their resources to detect, prevent, and prosecute cases of waste, fraud, and abuse on the CA/T Project.
Jointly, the offices provide independent state oversight to safeguard the interests of the public that they serve.
Office of the Attorney General
An independent, elected, constitutional officer, the Attorney General is the chief lawyer and law enforcement officer for the Commonwealth.
The Attorney General prosecutes criminal actions on behalf of the Commonwealth, and represents the Commonwealth and its departments, officers, and commissions in civil litigation and whenever the Commonwealth's official acts are called into question.
The Office of the Attorney General (OAG) is comprised of six bureaus: Executive, Criminal, Public Protection, Government, Business and Labor Protection, and Family and Community Crimes.
Each bureau is dedicated to protecting the public interest and the rights of the citizens of Massachusetts.
An important function of the OAG is to oversee law enforcement initiatives to combat waste, fraud, and abuse in the CA/T Project.
The OAG investigates and prosecutes unlawful activities arising out of the CA/T Project, including fraud, environmental offenses, and fair labor violations.
The OAG also investigates and conducts affirmative civil litigation, defends the Commonwealth in actions brought by third parties regarding the CA/T Project, and collaborates with CA/T Project management on developing aggressive proactive measures to reduce costs and prevent fraud.
Office of the State Auditor
The Office of the State Auditor (OSA) operates under the direction and control of an independent, elected constitutional officer.
The role of the OSA is to be a catalyst by promoting economy, efficiency, and effectiveness in state government, and to be responsive and progressive by assisting the Legislature, state executives, and program managers in carrying out their responsibilities.
In so doing, the OSA identifies and reports illegal acts of waste, abuse, and other inappropriate and questionable activities in order to foster corrective actions, savings, and improved program management for the benefit of the particular constituents and the taxpayers.
The OSA provides the Governor, the Legislature, auditees, oversight agencies, and the general public with an independent evaluation of the various agencies, activities, and programs operated by the Commonwealth.
Section 12 of M.G.L. c.11 provides the power for the OSA to perform audit work.
This statute requires the OSA to conduct its work in accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards published by the Comptroller General of the United States.
Office of the Inspector General
The Office of the Inspector General (OIG) was established in 1981 on the recommendation of the Special Commission on State and County Buildings, a special legislative commission, which spent two years probing corruption in the construction of public buildings in Massachusetts.
In the first of its 12-volume report documenting its findings of massive fraud and waste, and detailing its legislative recommendations for reform, the so-called "Ward Commission" described the new office:
The basic concept behind the Office of the Inspector General is that any institution...must build into itself a mechanism for self-criticism and self- correction....To prevent and detect (and the emphasis falls as much upon prevention as detection) fraud and waste ... the [Ward] Commission designed the Office of the Inspector General to be a neutral, impartial and independent office to fulfill that critical function.
The OIG has a broad mandate under M.G.L. c.12A to prevent and detect fraud, waste, and abuse in government.
Chapter 12A provides the OIG the power to subpoena records and people for investigations and management reviews, and to investigate both criminal and noncriminal violations of the law.
The OIG employs a staff of experienced specialists, including investigators, lawyers, management analysts, and engineers.
Special interdisciplinary teams are formed, if necessary, to meet the unique requirements of specific projects.
Preventing fraud, waste, and abuse before it happens is the OIG's principal objective.
THE SUPPLEMENTAL PLAN
The Supplemental Plan (Plan), submitted to the Legislature in October 1996, is the enabling document for the Commission.
The OAG, OSA, and OIG developed the Plan with the goal of creating strong, independent, and coordinated oversight of the CA/T Project.
The members believed that through an additional commitment of independent oversight resources, the expenditure of billions of tax dollars on the CA/T Project would be prudently protected.
In the Plan, the three offices established guidelines for the Commission and its Executive Director, and allocated work according to each office's expertise and concerns.
During development of the Plan, input was solicited from legislators who advocated project oversight, greater coordination among the oversight agencies, and cost savings.
Input also was solicited from CA/T Project management, which responded by identifying a number of areas where additional oversight might assist the CA/T Project in its cost containment efforts, including mitigation agreements, force accounts, and technical assistance.
Senior staff members of each agency meet monthly to discuss and coordinate matters of common concern.
The underlying goal of these senior staff working meetings is to identify cost savings and to provide a forum for sharing information and coordinating work, while avoiding unnecessary duplication of effort.
The Commission also holds quarterly coordinating sessions and includes the House and Senate Chairpersons of the Joint Committee on Transportation and the Chairpersons of the House and Senate Committees on Post Audit and Oversight, or their designees.
The diagram on the following page, taken from the Plan, illustrates areas of focus for each office and the interaction between the offices, and highlights topics of common interest that merit special attention.
The section of this report entitled Joint Projects and Coordination Initiatives on pages 8 and 9 identifies examples of how the Commission shares responsibility and information.

The bold print denoted areas of high priority for each office at the inception of the Plan.
The focus areas include activities funded by the $2 million authorized by Chapter 205 of the Acts of 1996, annual appropriations, and other sources, such as interdepartmental service agreements.
