Order 99-2-2
StifMD FEE 5 4 1999 -
Issued by the Department of Transportation on the 2nd day of February, 1999 Agreement Among Member Carriers of the INTERNATIONAL AIR TRANSPORT ASSOCIATION concerning passenger services matters: 4 Agreement Adopted by the Traffic Conferences of the International Air Transport Association 'ORDER The International Air Transport Association (IATA) has filed an agreement with the Department for approval and exemption from the U.S. antitrust laws under sections 41309 and 41308 of Title 49 of the United States Code.
The agreement was adopted at the Twentieth Passenger Services Conference held in Fort Lauderdale during October 13-15, 1998.
As such, they raise no public interest issues, and will be approved.
Substantive Chanqes: The agreement also: (1) amends a standard notice in Resolution Docket OST-98-4338-s Docket OST-98-4744-a R-l through R-9

was held in conjunction with the Nineteenth Joint ATA/IATA Passenger Services Conference.
2/ The individual resolutions and recommended practices, along with their subject matter, are listed in the attached appendix.
-2724a on denied boarding which members must include with tickets in countries where denied boarding compensation rules are in place, in order to meet the concerns expressed by the Department in Order 98-5-33 (May 28, 1998) which disapproved an earlier version of the notice; and (2) revalidates a ticket notice, applicable for EU countries only, which was originally adopted to meet the requirements of EU and UK legislation regarding changes in airline liability and corresponding notice requirements, and due to expire on January 31, 1999, for an additional period through March 31, 2000, so as to give governments and airlines sufficient time to develop language for a single, comprehensive liability notice that meets government requirements in all markets.
We will approve IATA's amended notice on denied boarding The revised notice compensation as set forth in Resolution 724a. clearly states that it does not apply in the U.S. and its territories.
We interpret that to mean that the notice will not be included on or with any tickets sold in the U.S. for transportation originating in the U.S.
Against that background, we conclude that IATA's notice revision adequately deals with the concern raised in Order 98-5-33 that its notice should not undermine the Department's own, more explicit notice pertaining to denied boarding compensation as set out in 14 CFR s250.11.
Last, we will approve the revalidation of the EU liability notice for a limited period to September 30, 1999.
By Order 98-10-16 (October 16, 19981, we approved, as a stopgap measure and only to January 31, 1999, a notice of liability provisions for use on airline tickets issued in EU countries, including tickets for This EU notice transportation to and from the United States.
would not affect the ticket notice mandated under 14 C.F.R. 121.175 of the Department's Regulations, which would still be required in addition to IATA's EU notice.L/ In that order, we noted that "we are not endorsing the language of the notice", and that we "anticipate that, before [January 31, 19991, affected carriers and governments will have agreed upon satisfactory language, which can be endorsed by the Department."
We are concerned that there have not been greater efforts by IATA to coordinate with ATA and other interested persons on the appropriate language for the EU notice.
We do consider it necessary that U.S. carriers and other interested U.S. parties
3/ We noted in Order 98-10-16 that this EU notice would not affect the Department's ticket notice mandated under 14 C.F.R. 121.175 of the Department's Regulations, which would still be required in We also took into account the addition to the IATA's EU notice.
fact that, under EU regulations, carriers who have not fully implemented the EU requirements must also include a ticket notice of their applicable liability conditions.
-3coordinate on language used for notices for transportation between EU countries and the U.S., including notices whose use is limited to tickets sold in EU countries.
In this connection, we point out that, in Order 98-8-28, we have extended antitrust immunity to IATA, ATA and other interested persons "to consider, inter alia, a common notice provision (to replace other required notices) for those carriers that had implemented the IPA or MIA Agreements through tariffs filed with, and accepted by, the Department" (including EU carriers which had implemented the EU regulations and filed appropriate implementing tariffs with the Department).
Because of the exigencies set forth in Order 98-10-16, we will extend our previous approval of the notice to allow additional
time for IATA and its member airlines to work with the relevant authorities, carriers, and other interested persons to develop appropriate language for notices that provide fair and meaningful disclosure to consumers and meet the requirements of carriers who have implemented either the IATA or ATA Agreements, or EU
Regulations,
and filed implementing tariffs with the Department.
We will not, however, extend our approval to March 31, 2000, as requested by IATA.
Rather, we will extend it to be coextensive with the antitrust immunity granted in Order 98-8-28, i.e., until
September 30, 1999.
We believe an additional eight months should be ample for IATA to coordinate with appropriate authorities, ATA, and other interested U.S. persons as contemplated in Order Ye-lo16, and in accordance with the discussion authority and antitrust immunity granted in Order 98-8-28.
Accordingly, our approval of the EU notice will terminate September 30, 1999.
Section 41309 of the Code directs us to approve any agreement or modification of an agreement if we find that it will not substantially lessen competition, and is not adverse to the public
interest or in violation of the Code.
We find that the agreement in Docket OST-98-4744, as conditioned, is not adverse to the public interest, in violation of the Code, or likely to lessen competition substantially, and that it should be approved.
Furthermore, we conclude that the agreement immunity from the operation of the antitrust necessary to permit its implementation.

To the extent that R-l through R-Y of the agreement in Docket OST-98-4744 are approved, we exempt any person affected by this order from the operation of the antitrust laws as provided in 49 U.S.C. 41308; and Order 98-10-X is amended by deleting the date January 31, 3 1999, from the ordering paragraph of that order, and substituting the date "September 30, 1999", so that the ordering paragraph will "We approve and grant antitrust immunity to the agreement read: contained in Docket OST-98-4338 until September 30, 1999."
