Milk production is rebounding in the Southeast while steady to seasonally lower in the Northeast.
Fluid milk supplies are still tight, but not as tight as they were last week.
Bottled milk sales are steady to slower.
Contacts report slower sales of bottled milk in the South which is easing the need for "outside" milk.

The number of cows has increased from last year and production continues to be higher than a year ago.
In the far northern milk producing regions, milk production levels remain good.
Conditions remain decent for early fall - sunny and dry days leading to continued good pasture growth.
In the Central Valley, milk production is steady to higher.
In the south, milk output and solids are noted to be higher.
Fluid milk sales are said to be good seasonally with supplies and demand in balance as orders become more predictable.
Feeding conditions remain good at mainly good prices.
Higher quality alfalfa prices are steady to higher with more dairies buying.
There remains good demand for other feed supplies.

Cooler weather conditions have helped increase milk output in Arizona.
High temperatures dropped below 100 degrees and nighttime readings are declining.
This follows a record setting week of high daytime temperatures.
There remains some lingering effect of the recent heat, but production is indicated to be increasing.Milk production in the Pacific Northwest may be starting to rebound somewhat from the late summer doldrums.
Manufacturing plants continue to run on reduced schedules as the milk starts to come back and because of the heavy call for fluid milk for the bottle.
Fat and protein tests are increasing seasonally.
The corn silage harvest is well underway and may finish up by next week.
Quality and volumes look good.
Pasture quality is improving and some late season hay continues to be made.
Hay curing is slow at this time of the year.
Therefore, the quality of this hay may be questionable.
Some light snow fell over parts of northern Utah and southern Idaho.
Light frost was also common.
The frost is late enough to not cause any real cropping problems and any moisture is welcome.
Herd expansions continue at a strong pace.
Milk production, while down seasonally, is heavy.
Most milk producers are hoping for a mild winter related to hay availability and prices.

Information gathered for this report is from trades, offers to sell, and secondary data.
This bi-weekly report may not always contain the same products and/or regions.

MT = metric ton = 2,204.6 pounds.
WESTERN AND EASTERN EUROPE OVERVIEW: WESTERN EUROPE: European milk production continues to decline seasonally.
In most production areas, annual production is nearly at the bottom of the seasonal cycle.
Production of manufactured dairy products is also declining.
In most instances, manufacturers are diverting milk towards the area of most need.
Early on in the current milk production season, much of the seasons manufactured dairy products were fully committed.
Now as the milk production season nears the end, producers and handlers are trying to fill those commitments.
In instances, producers and handlers are having difficulty making timely shipments and are having to source their needs elsewhere.
On the other hand, some producers are reporting slightly more available stocks.
These situations are being uncovered by previous commitments now being fully filled and additional end of season production is now starting to become available.
Overall,prices remain unchanged and firm, although handlers and traders are questioning how long will they remain so, before a possible weakening might occur.
BUTTER/BUTTEROIL: European butter markets are generally steady at unchanged prices.
Stocks are reported to be in close balance for current, fair at best, demand.
No significant new buyer interest is being reported at this time.
The upcoming Ramadan holiday in the Middle East might stir buyer interest with Russian buyer interest still unclear.
Butter/powder production is seasonally light as end of season milk volumes are being directed toward cheese output.
82% BUTTERFAT: 99% BUTTERFAT: 1,400 - 1,500 1,425 - 1,600 OCEANIA OVERVIEW: Milk production in both New Zealand and Australia continues to climb toward the seasonal peak.
Early reports are indicating that overall output continues to run ahead of last year at this time.
Manufacturing schedules are increasing accordingly in the region.
Strong international buyer interest from regular and new buyers is keeping stocks in very close balance.
Often, significant new buyer interest is going unfilled at this time.
Active buyer interest in butter, often from oil-rich Middle Eastern countries is reducing uncommitted production of butter in the region.
Japanese reaction to recent health scares related to dairy products is impacting consumer confidence and demand.
This is reducing the demand for some dairy products in the region.
Due to this unsettling demand situation, milk is being diverted from various manufactured dairy products and towards others.
Currency adjustments are affecting prices, but probably not as much as in Europe with the currency intervention on the Euro late last week.
BUTTER: Butter production in the Oceania region continues to seasonally increase.
Potential market developments with cheese are causing more milk to be directed towards butter/powder, thus stocks are being generated at a faster rate than earlier anticipated.
Strong international butterfat interest is occurring, particularly from Muslim countries for the upcoming Ramadan holiday in late November.
Although butter production is increasing, firm demand is clearing good volumes, thus overall stock levels are not heavy at this time.
In many instances, butter stocks are being committed to regular/ongoing buyers, with new buyer interest lighter from the region.
82% BUTTERFAT: 1,250 - 1,350 CHEDDAR CHEESE: Cheese prices are unchanged, although the market tone is unsettled.
The recent health scare related to dairy products in the Japanese market is impacting consumer confidence and potential cheese demand.

Most shipments are filling regular/ongoing buyer needs.
39% MAXIMUM MOISTURE: 1,800 - 1,900 SKIM MILK POWDER (SMP): Skim milk powder markets remain firm.
Butter/powder production is increasing seasonally.
A recent market development and potentially lighter cheese demand is causing some milk handlers to divert milk away from cheese towards butter/powder.
With heavier butter/powder production, skim stocks are heavier than previously anticipated for this time of the season, although strong international demand is keeping stocks in close balance.
At this time, most sales from the Oceania region are to regular/ongoing buyers with strong international buyer interest going unfilled.
1.25% BUTTERFAT: 2,150 - 2,250 WHOLE MILK POWDER (WMP): Whole milk powder markets are generally steady at unchanged prices.
Demand for whole milk powder is seasonally active, although not as strong as other milk powders.

26% BUTTERFAT: 1,900 - 2,050 Exchange rates for selected foreign currencies: SEPTEMBER 25, 2000 SKIM MILK POWDER (SMP): Skim milk powder prices remain firm, although the market tone is somewhat unsettled.
Lack of supply continues to limit significant sales activity.
Most producers continue to fill previously made commitments, although scattered reports are indicating that some late season uncommitted production is starting to surface.
Traders and handlers are still unclear as to the volume of this additional powder and what potential impact it will have on prices as the winter season approaches.
1.25% BUTTERFAT: 2,100 - 2,350 WHOLE MILK POWDER (WMP): Whole milk powder markets are generally steady at unchanged prices.
Powder availability is limited due to the strong demand for other milk based products and previous commitments.
Overall demand has been and continues to be light.
Producers and handlers do not foresee much change in this market until next spring, once the new milk production season resumes, at the earliest.
26% BUTTERFAT: SWEET WHEY POWDER: Whey powder unchanged prices.
Stocks of whey are readily season cheese production is generating heavier time of the year.
Firm European prices are overall buying interest is light.
NONHYGROSCOPIC: 1,900 - 2,150 markets are generally steady at available.
Heavier than usual late than usual whey volumes for this limiting sales activity, although 475 - 575 OVERVIEW: EASTERN EUROPE: Milk production in Eastern Europe continues to follow the trend of all season.
In most instances, milk output has not attained last year's levels, thus overall dairy product supplies have been lighter.
Stocks of manufactured dairy products are lower this year, thus less has been committed to outside sales.
Much of the season's output was committed early on in the season, thus producers are trying to finish those orders as the milk production season comes to a close.
