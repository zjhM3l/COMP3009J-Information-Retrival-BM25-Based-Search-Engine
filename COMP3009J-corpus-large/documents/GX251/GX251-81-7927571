Section 185.1.1
A state agency or institution of higher education shall not take adverse action against an employee because the employee, or a person authorized to act on behalf of the employee, communicates in good faith the existence of waste of public funds, property, or manpower, including federal funds, property, or manpower, administered or controlled by a public employer or a violation or suspected violation of a law, rule, or regulation adopted under the law of this State or a political subdivision of the state to an appropriate authority.
The communication shall be made at a time and in a manner which gives the public employer reasonable notice of need to correct the waste or violation.

For purposes of subsection 1.1 a state employee communicates in good faith if there is a reasonable basis in fact for the communication of the existence of waste or of a violation.

Section 185.1.8
As used in this section, "damages" means damages for a job-related injury or loss caused by each violation of the "Whistle-Blower" act, including, but not limited to, fringe benefits, retirement service credit, compensation for lost wages, benefits, and any other remuneration, and reasonable court costs and attorneys' fees.
Section 185.1.9
A state agency or institution of higher education shall have an affirmative defense to a civil action brought by a state employee if the adverse action taken against the state employee was due to employee misconduct, poor job performance or a reduction in workforce unrelated to a communication made pursuant to the "Whistle-Blower" protections.
The state agency or institution of higher education must prove the existence of the state employee's misconduct, poor job performance or a reduction in workforce is unrelated to the communication by a preponderance of the evidence.

Section 185.2.3
The "Whistle-Blower" Act shall not be construed to permit a disclosure which would diminish or impair the rights of any person or any public official to the continued protection of confidentiality of records or working papers where a statute or the common law provides for protection.
