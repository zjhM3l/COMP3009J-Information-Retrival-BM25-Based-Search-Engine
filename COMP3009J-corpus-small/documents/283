laminar heat transfer around blunt bodies in dissociated air. a method of predicting laminar heat-transfer rates to blunt, highly cooled bodies with constant wall temperature in dissociated air flow is developed. attention is restricted to the case of axisymmetric bodies at zero incidence, although two-dimensional bodies could be treated the same way. the method is based on the use of the /local similarity/ concept and an extension of the ideas used by fay and riddell. a simple formula is given for predicting the ratio of local heat-transfer rate to stagnation-point rate. it depends on wall conditions and pressure distribution, but not on the thermodynamic or transport properties of the hot external flow, except at the stagnation point. experimental heat-transfer rates obtained with correct stagnation-point simulation and high wall cooling in shock tubes are also presented and compared with the theoretical predictions. on the whole, the agreement is good, although in regions of rapidly varying pressure there is evidence that the local similarity assumption breaks down, and the theory underestimates the actual heat-transfer rate by up to 25 per cent.
