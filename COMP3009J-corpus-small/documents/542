biot's variational principle in heat conduction. biot's variational principle is applied to a number of different one-dimensional heat conduction problems. these problems show the applicability of the variational principle to problems involving prescribed heat flux boundary conditions and to those with temperature-dependent material properties. a method is introduced for including boundary conditions when these are expressed as prescribed heat fluxes. the idea behind this is overall energy balance within the body, which is a constraint condition to be satisfied by the time histories of the generalized coordinates. the variational principle is then applied to the well-known problem of constant surface heat flux in order to present the technique and provide a basis for the remaining sections. the equivalence of the result obtained in applying the variational principle for a prescribed surface temperature history to that obtained for a prescribed heat flux is also pointed out. radiation cooling due to fourth power radiation from semi-infinite solids and finite slabs together with radiation according to newton's law of cooling is then treated. finally, the introduction of temperature-dependent material properties is discussed and the determination of the temperature distribution in a semi-infinite solid with variable properties is investigated.
