on the role of initial imperfections in plastic buckling of cylinders under axial compression. in a recent paper lee treated the complex problem of the plastic buckling and postbuckling behavior of an axially compressed cylindrical shell containing initial imperfections, representing an important step forward in our understanding of this common, yet perplexing, structural element. lee drew two major conclusions.. (a) even with initial imperfections the incremental theory of plasticity considerably overestimates the buckling strength as compared with the deformation theory, which is in substantially good agreement with experiments, and strength of cylindrical shells subject to axial compression are significant. it is the purpose of this note to discuss the second conclusion in terms of lee's experimental and theoretical results, other experimental data on inelastic buckling of 7075-t6 aluminum-alloy cylinders, and recent theoretical results on the inelastic buckling of cylinders in the axisymmetric and circumferential modes. in particular, this writer does not believe that lee has proved that initial imperfections are important for the group of cylinders that he has tested. on the contrary, it is believed that initial imperfections are completely insignificant for this group of cylinders although of probable significance in other cases.
