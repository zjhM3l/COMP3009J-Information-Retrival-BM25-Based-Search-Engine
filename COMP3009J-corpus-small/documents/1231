hypersonic flow over an elliptic cone: theory and experiment. by applying hypersonic approximations to ferri's linearized characteristics method, simple results were obtained for the shock shape and surface pressure distribution for an unyawed conical body of arbitrary cross section. calculations were carried out for an elliptic cone having a ratio of major to minor axes of, and a semivertex angle of about 12 in the meridian plane containing the major axis. an experimental investigation of the flow over this body conducted at a mach number of 5.8 in the galcit hypersonic wind tunnel showed that the surface pressure distribution at zero angle of attack agreed quite closely with the theoretical prediction. on the other hand, the simple newtonian approximation predicts pressures that are too low. surface pressure distributions and schlieren photographs of the shock shape were obtained at angles of attack up to 14 at zero yaw, and at angles of yaw up to 10 at zero pitch. at the higher angles of attack the newtonian approximation for the surface pressures is quite accurate.
