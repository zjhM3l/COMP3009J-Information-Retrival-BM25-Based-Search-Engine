low speed tests on 45 sweptback wings. this report contains the results of pressure measurements on three and aspect ratio 5, over an incidence range up to 10. chordwise and spanwise lift distributions are given, mostly near the centre where, on two of the wings, modifications had been made to the section shape. it was found that altering the thickness distribution in the centre did not affect the loading but that approximately straight isobars could be obtained at values of below about 0.1. by the incorporation of twist and camber in the central part the distortion of the lift distribution in the centre could be avoided at one particular incidence, and thus the same chordwise distribution obtained over most of the span. twist and camber alone do not improve the isobar pattern and therefore a thickness modification would be needed to give the desired lift distribution and isobar pattern at one particular incidence. the results of experimental investigations of the boundary layer and of the effect of aspect ratio will be given in a later report.
