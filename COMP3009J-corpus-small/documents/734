the bending of uniformly loaded clamped plate in the form of a circular sector. the deflexion of a uniformly loaded plate in the form of a semicircle clamped along its boundary is obtained by a method due to weinstein. this problem requires the solution of the biharmonic equation where z is given, subject to the conditions that w = 0 and on the boundary, n being the direction of the outward normal. the solution is expressed in the form where, writing is found by solving (in succession) two harmonic equations of the forms where z may be zero, and where f and have to satisfy certain boundary conditions. the constants are then determined to satisfy the boundary condition. numerical calculations show that five or six terms of the series give a good approximation to the accurate value as judged by the closeness with which the approximate solution satisfies the boundary condition. the procedure to be adopted in the case of the general circular sector and for non-uniform loading is indicated briefly. the connexion between the deflexion problem and that of plane strain in which the stress function satisfies the equation, where and have given values on the boundary, is discussed as a preliminary to the further consideration of the latter problem by a method of the same type.
