the flow about a moving body in the upper ionosphere. a particle approach is used to study the flow pattern around a body moving in the upper layers of the ionosphere. the effects of distant encounters between charged particles (dynamic friction) and of the earth's magnetic field are taken into account. it is shown that, when the magnetic lines of force are parallel to the direction of motion of the body, there may be a marked concentration of charged particles in the vicinity of the body and a considerable fraction of the reflected or deflected charged particles may reimpinge on the body surface. a numerical example is given for the size and shape of the charged- particle-density contours in the flow field surrounding a circular disc, and these are compared with the corresponding neutral-particle contours.
