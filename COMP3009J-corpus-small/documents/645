thermodynamic coupling in boundary layers. experimental results gathered in recent years for binary mixture mass transfer models are shown to yield consistent evidence of discrepancies with analytic considerations. specifically, measured recovery temperatures are appreciably higher than those predicted ,. while heat transfer coefficients are satisfactorily reproduced. it is shown on the basis of both approximate and exact solutions for plates and stagnation points that the discrepancies in previous results are related to thermal diffusion effects, a major influence being apparent in application of the surface boundary condition for an adiabatic wall. as a result, some reexamination is necessary of past criteria for mass addition effects as they pertain to specific injected media. a prime example is the /equivalence/ of helium and air as coolants despite the heretofore suggested preference for low density injectants on a perfect gas basis. ref. 16.
