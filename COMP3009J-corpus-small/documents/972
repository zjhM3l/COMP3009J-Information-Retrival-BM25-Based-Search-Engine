aerodynamic interaction effects ahead of a sonic jet exhausting perpendicularly form a flat plate into a mach number 6 free stream. an investigation of the effects of the interaction ahead of a two-dimensional sonic jet exhausting perpendicularly into a mach number were made at an angle of attack of 0degree at a reynolds number per foot of approximately 6 x 10 and with conditions of both transitional and turbulent separation on the flat plate. the ratio of jet stagnation pressure to free-stream static pressure was varied from 8 to 460 and the jet slot width was varied from 0.001 to 0.05 inch. the force ratio due to reaction of jet/, calculated ahead of the jet, was sizable and varied from 0.5 to 9. in general, the ratio increased with increasing pressure ratio and decreasing slot width. for the turbulent boundary-layer separation tests it was found that the first peak pressure and the chordwise pressure distribution of the separated boundary layer ahead of the jet were similar to those for a separation caused by a forward-facing step at the same test conditions.
