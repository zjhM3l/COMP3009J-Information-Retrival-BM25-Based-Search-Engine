note on creep buckling of columns. a variational theorem is presented for a body undergoing creep. solutions to problems of the creep behavior of plates, columns, beams, and shells can be obtained by means of the direct methods of the calculus of variations in conjunction with the stated theorem. the application of the theorem is illustrated for plates and columns by the solution of two sample problems.
