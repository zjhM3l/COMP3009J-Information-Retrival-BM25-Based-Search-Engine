approximate determination of position of the sonic line for a blunt body in hypersonic flow. the detached shock in front of a blunt body in hypersonic flow tends to acquire the shape of the frontal curvature of the body. thus the curvature of the shock can be assumed to be the same as that of the body, at least up to the sonic point (point a, fig. 1). if the equation of curvature of the body is known, the equation of curvature of the shock is also known. in this paper, with this assumption, a method is described to determine the approximate position of the sonic line (ao'b, fig. 1). the shock-detachment distance is assumed known. the method is, of course, general. this can be applied to any detached shock provided its equation of curvature is known corresponding to that of the body. for simplicity the detached shock is assumed to be circular in this paper and the procedure is outlined below with the assumption that the sonic line ao'b is parabolic.
