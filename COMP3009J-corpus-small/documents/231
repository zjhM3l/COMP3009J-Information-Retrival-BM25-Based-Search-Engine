practical calculation of second-order supersonic flow past non-lifting bodies of revolution. calculation of second-order supersonic flow past bodies of revolution at zero angle of attack is described in detail, and reduced to routine computation. use of an approximate tangency condition is shown to increase the accuracy for bodies with corners. tables of basic functions and standard computing forms are presented. the procedure is summarized so that one can apply it without necessarily understanding the details of the theory. a sample calculation is given, and several examples are compared with solutions calculated by the method of characteristics.
