chemical kinetics of high temperature air. when a hypersonic object enters earth's atmosphere, a shock wave is formed in front of it, and the air passing through this shock wave is heated to high temperatures. the shock heated molecules equilibrate their translational and rotational degrees of freedom within a distance of a few mean free paths. to achieve equilibrium, it is necessary to excite vibration, dissociate molecules, produce new molecules and produce ions and electrons. the problem is complex, since all these phenomena occur simultaneously and because the reaction rates depend on the temperature, density and composition which are changing during the relaxation toward equilibrium. the experimental techniques used to investigate these reactions are briefly discussed along with the resulting rate expressions obtained by the various investigators. a compilation of the rate expressions for these reactions representing the author's evaluation of all the available data is presented. several pertinent problems which are not yet completely understood and which still require theoretical and experimental investigation are outlined. computed concentration, temperature and density time histories are shown for three different shock speeds in air. the time rate of change of concentration for each chemical reaction is also shown and regimes of importance for the various processes are discussed.
