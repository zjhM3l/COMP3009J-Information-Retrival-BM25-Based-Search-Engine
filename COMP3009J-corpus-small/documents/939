some explicit solutions for constant-temp. magnetogas dynamic channel flow. in order to simplify the process of estimating the aerodynamic loading on the after portions of slender vehicles, it is frequently assumed that there is no nose-tail interaction. it is the purpose of this note to show that, aside from boundary-layer effects, this assumption is not warranted when the nose hypersonic-similarity parameter, tan, is of the order of unity, or greater. physically speaking, the entropy change associated with a strong bow wave reduces the stagnation pressure down-stream of the shock, and hence, lowers the dynamic pressure in the vicinity of the tail.
