buckling of circular cones under axial compression. presented are the results of an experimental investigation to determine the buckling strength of right circular cones under axial compression. correlation of these data is made with existing theory and with previously published experimental data on circular cylinders,. thus a recommended procedure for predicting the buckling load of right circular cones under the foregoing loading condition is presented.
