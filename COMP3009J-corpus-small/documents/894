flutter of a two dimensional simply supported buckled panel with elastic restraint against edge displacement. the critical flutter speed is evaluated for a two-dimensional thin buckled panel with one surface exposed to a supersonic airstream and the other to still air at the same static pressure. the panel is simply supported along the leading and trailing edges by rigid edge members separated by an elastic member represented by a compression spring. the whole system is acted upon by a constant compressive force uniformly distributed along the edge members. the aerodynamic forces acting on the deflected panel are found from two-dimensional /quasi-steady/ theory, valid for slow oscillations where the downwash velocity is small compared with the speed of flow and provided that the mach number is sufficiently greater than. the elastic behaviour of the panel is given by von karman's large deflection equations modified to cover initially curved plates. the solution of the equations is carried out by means of galerkin's method, which has been shown to give valid results for a panel with a non-zero bending rigidity. the influence of the midplane compressive force carried by the panel itself, the initial buckle amplitude and the elastic restraint against edge displacements is investigated, and curves are presented giving the critical dynamic pressure ratio as a function of these variables.
