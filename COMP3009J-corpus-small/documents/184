scale models for thermo-aeroelastic research. an investigation is made of the parameters to be satisfied for thermo-aeroelastic similarity. it is concluded that complete similarity obtains only when aircraft and model are identical in all respects, including size. by limiting consideration to conduction effects, by assuming the major load carrying parts of the structure are in regions where the flow is either entirely laminar, or entirely turbulent, and by assuming a specific relationship between reynolds number and nusselt number, an approach to similarity can be achieved for small scale models. experimental and analytical work is required to check on the validity of these assumptions. it appears that existing hot wind tunnels will not be completely adequate for thermo-aeroelastic work, and accordingly a possible layout for the type of tunnel required is described. automatic programmed control of the tunnel would appear to be necessary.
