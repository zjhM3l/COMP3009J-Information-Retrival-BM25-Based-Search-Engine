pressure distribution induced on a flat plate by a supersonic and sonic jet exhaust at a free-stream mach number of 1.80. as a continuation of previous research at mach numbers of 2.02 and 1.39, an experimental investigation was made of the pressures induced on a flat plate by a propulsive jet exhausting from sonic and supersonic nozzles at a free-stream mach number of 1.80. measurements of the pressure distribution on a flat-plate wing were made at zero angle of attack for four different locations of the jet exhaust nozzle beneath the wing. both a choked convergent nozzle and a convergent-divergent nozzle on the nacelle were used. the nozzles were operated at nacelle-exit total-pressure ratios from 2 to 16 and the reynolds number per foot was approximately 13 x 10. two distinct shock waves impinged on the wing surface and greatly altered the pressure distribution at all nozzle positions. positive incremental normal force resulted on the wing at all positions. comparisons are presented for two free-stream mach numbers.
