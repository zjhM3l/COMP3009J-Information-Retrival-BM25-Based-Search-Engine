numerical determination of indical lift of a two-dimensional sinking airfoil at subsonic mach numbers from oscillatory lift coefficients with calculations for mach number 0.7. the reciprocal equations for relating the incompressible circulatory indicial lift to the lift due to harmonic oscillations have been modified to include the noncirculatory lift associated with apparent-mass effects. although the apparent-mass effects are impulsive in nature in incompressible flow, the lift due to apparent-mass effects in compressible flow is a time-dependent function. the corresponding reciprocal equations for the total compressible lift are given. by use of the reciprocal equations for compressible flow, the indicial lift and moment functions due to an airfoil's experiencing a sudden acquisition of vertical velocity are determined numerically for mach number 0.7. lack of sufficient flutter coefficients prevents the calculation of these functions at other mach numbers. although the indicial lift and moment functions due to penetration of a sharp-edge gust may be obtained from the oscillatory tab or aileron coefficients by a similar analysis, sufficient coefficients are not available at the present. however, an approximate method is shown for determining a portion of this unsteady-lift function. when a comparison is made of the indicial lift functions at mach numbers appears to be less rapid for the compressible case than for the incompressible case. consequently, the calculation of the gust load factor at high subsonic mach numbers utilizing the two-dimensional incompressible indicial lift functions and an over-all correction for compressibility such as the prandtl-glauert factor might be conservative.
