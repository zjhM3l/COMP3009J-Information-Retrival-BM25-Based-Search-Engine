the flow pattern on a tapered sweptback wing at mach numbers between 0.6 and 1.6. the development of the flow pattern on a swept wing with incidence and stream mach number is described. the wing, of aspect ratio 2 828, taper ratio 0 333 and leading-edge sweep 53 5 deg, was tested at mach numbers between 0 6 and 1 6 at incidences up to about 12 deg. the test reynolds number varied with mach number, being typically 2 3 x 10 at m leading edge. it is shown that the flow pattern at moderate incidences develops smoothly from a subsonic type involving leading-edge separation to a supersonic type where the flow is attached near the leading edge and with shock-induced separation further aft. the formation and movement of the shock-wave system and the vortices near the wing surface are briefly discussed.
