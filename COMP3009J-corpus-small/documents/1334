calculated spanwise lift distributions and aerodynamic influence coefficients for swept wings in subsonic flow. spanwise lift distributions have been calculated for 61 swept wings with various aspect ratios and taper ratios and with a variety of angle-of-attack or twist distributions, including flap and aileron deflections, by means of the weissinger method with eight control points on the semispan. also calculated for these plan forms were aerodynamic influence coefficients which pertain to a certain definite set of stations along the span. the information presented herein can thus be used both in the analysis of untwisted wings or wings with known twist distributions and in aeroelastic calculations involving initially unknown twist distributions. this paper supplements and is intended to be used in conjunction with naca tn 3014, where the same type of information, calculated in the same way, is presented for 19 unswept wings.
