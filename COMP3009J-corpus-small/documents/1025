note on creep buckling of columns. the creep of a slightly crooked section column carrying a constant load is studied theoretically. the material of the column is characterized by a strain-time relationship, under constant uniaxial stress, of the form, where is the total strain, is the constant stress, is the time, and e,a,b, and k are material constants. this form was selected because it applies to at least two alloys--75s-t6 aluminum alloy at 600 f. and a low-alloy steel at 800 and 1,100 f. however, the analysis is intended for any material having creep properties of the same form and for which the material constants are known. a strain-time relationship under variable uniaxial stress, necessary for the column analysis, is formulated from the constant-stress properties with the aid of shanley's engineering hypotheses of creep. the analysis leads to the conclusion that the lateral deflection approaches infinity--that is, the column collapses--in finite time. results are given showing the maximum length of time the column can support a given load before it collapses and the growth of stresses, strains, and deflections prior to collapse.
