the asymptotic boundary layer on a circular cylinder in axial incompressible flow. in this paper the incompressible boundary layer over a circular cylinder in an axial flow is investigated far from the leading edge. if u and v are the velocity components in the x and r direction respectively and a stream function is introduced by and, then for a constant free-stream velocity has the following asymptotic form.. where the p's are determined successively, first for s=1 and all t, then s=2 and all t, etc., from ordinary differential equations. here and log c=euler's constant. it is shown that the effect of the curvature of the body (in planes perpendicular to the flow) is to increase the skin friction. also the case in which the free-stream velocity is proportional to (at the method breaks down), is studied. it is concluded that the effect of the curvature of the cylinder, when the boundary layer has a thickness comparable with its radius of curvature, is to delay separation.
