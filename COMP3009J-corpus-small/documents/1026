note on creep buckling of columns. this paper is concerned with the solution of the creep buckling of columns. instantaneous elastic and plastic deformations, as well as the transient and secondary creep, are considered. formulae for the critical time at which a column fails are presented for integral values of the exponents appearing in the creep law.
