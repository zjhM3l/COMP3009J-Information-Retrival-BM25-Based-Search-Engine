pressure distributions and flow patterns at m=4. on some delta wings of inverted 'v' cross section. wind tunnel tests have been made to measure pressure distributions and to study flow patterns on a series of delta wings of inverted 'v' cross-section. each of these wings was designed to have a plane shock wave in the plane of the leading edges at a chosen mach number and incidence. it was found that for a wide incidence range about the design point the shock wave remained virtually attached to the leading edges and at each incidence the pressure was approximately constant over the lower surface.
