waves in supersonic flow. in this chapter we shall mainly consider problems of steady, two- dimensional (plane) supersonic flow. using the fact that in this case there is a steady wave system, we shall find solutions by an indirect approach. that is, we shall first study the conditions under which simple stationary waves may exist in the flow, and then find the flow boundaries to which they correspond or which may be fitted to them. in this procedure the limited upstream influence in a supersonic field is very helpful, for it allows flows to be analyzed or constructed step by step, which is a method that is not possible in the subsonic case.
