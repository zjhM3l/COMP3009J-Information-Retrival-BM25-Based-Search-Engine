general instability of stiffened cylinders. theoretical buckling stresses are determined in explicit form for circular cylinders with circumferential and axial stiffening. the loadings are axial compression, radial pressure, hydrostatic pressure, and torsion. analyses were confined to moderate-length and long cylinders. the investigation was based upon the use of a form of donnell's equation derived by taylor which is applicable to orthotropic cylinders. the derivation of this equation is presented in this report.
