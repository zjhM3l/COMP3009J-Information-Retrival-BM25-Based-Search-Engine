compressible boundary layers on bodies of revolution. in a former paper (1) it has been shown that the behaviour of the laminar boundary layer on a body of revolution can be described mathematically by the same equations which are also applied to the processes in the laminar boundary layer in the two-dimensional flow along a body contour, the form of which is determined by the shape of the body of revolution. a simple relation exists between the two-dimensional boundary layers and the axially symmetrical ones. the flow had been assumed to be incompressible. in this report it shall be shown that this relation is still valid when the compressibility is taken into consideration. the distribution of velocity as well as that of temperature in the laminar boundary layer of a body of revolution can be calculated by solving the corresponding problem for the two-dimensional flow around a suitable contour. the method is made clear by the example of the supersonic flow towards a cone tip,. this example has already been treated by another method by hantzsche and wendt (2).
