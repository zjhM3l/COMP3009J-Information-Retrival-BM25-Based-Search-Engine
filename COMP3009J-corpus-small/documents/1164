effect of ground proximity on the aerodynamic characteristics of a four- engined vertical take-off and landing transport airplane model with tilting wing and propellers. an investigation has been made to study the effect of ground proximity on the aerodynamic characteristics of a four-engine vertical- take-off-and-landing transport-airplane model with tilting wing and propellers. tests were made with the wing at an angle of incidence of 90, the position used for vertical take-off or landing. with the model at various heights above the ground, the lift, drag, and pitching moment were measured and tuft studies were made to determine the flow field caused by the propeller slipstream. data were obtained for the complete model, for the model with horizontal tail removed, and for the wing-propeller combination alone. the results of the investigation showed that, when the model was hovering near the ground, there was a strong upwash in the plane of symmetry and also an increase in lift of about 10 percent of the propeller thrust. about one-half of this lift resulted from an increase in propeller thrust and one-half resulted from an up load on the fuselage induced by the upwash. as the model approached the ground, it also experienced an increasing nose-down pitching moment that evidently resulted from the up load on the fuselage, the rear part of which was longer than the front part. the addition of the horizontal tail which was located about halfway up the vertical tail did not increase the nose-down pitching moment because the fuselage decreased the energy of the upwash before it reached the tail.
