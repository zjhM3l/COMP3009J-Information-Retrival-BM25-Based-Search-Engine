effect of mach number on boundary layer transition in the presence of pressure rise and surface roughness on an ogive-cylinder body with cold wall conditions. the effect of mach number variation from 1.8 to 7.4 on boundary-layer transition was investigated on a slender fin-stabilized ogive-cylinder body in free flight at a constant length reynolds number of 13.8 million. the wall to free-stream temperature ratio was constant at a value of 1.0 below mach number 4.5 and at a value of of the test showed that increasing mach number had a very favorable effect of increasing the extent of the laminar boundary layer for a given surface roughness. the transition data, when plotted as a function of a factor indicative of heat transfer, showed that heat transfer was possibly responsible for a good deal of the increase in transition reynolds number with mach number. transition was found to occur farther forward on the sheltered side of the body than on the windward side for angles of attack as low as 0.4 and for all mach numbers. the pressure rise along sheltered-side stream-lines was examined and it was found that the pressure-rise coefficient at the transition point, showed no variation with mach number. data from other sources for different test conditions, when reduced to values of pressure-rise coefficient, were also found to correlate well with that of the present investigation with the exception of data at low subsonic mach numbers. these present results also show that mach number, surface roughness, pressure rise, and length reynolds number all affected boundary-layer transition in the region of theoretical infinite laminar stability to small two-dimensional disturbances as calculated for a flat plate with zero pressure gradient.
