steady magnetohydrodynamic flow past a non-conducting wedge. this paper presents a study of the steady two-dimensional magnetohydrodynamic flow of an infinitely conducting fluid past a nonconducting wedge with nonaligned flow and magnetic field. the flows considered are in the /superfast/ or fully hyperbolic regime. the flows consist of several regions of uniformity connected by shocks and expansion waves. because of the boundary condition on the magnetic field, the magnetic field must be the same in the regions above and below the wedge,. thus the flows in these regions are coupled, unlike in the case of ordinary supersonic gasdynamics. only small wedge angles and weak waves (characteristics) are considered. the problem thus is linearized, and explicit solutions are obtained which are qualitatively similar to the nonlinear solutions. some interesting and unexpected features arise, and they are discussed in detail.
