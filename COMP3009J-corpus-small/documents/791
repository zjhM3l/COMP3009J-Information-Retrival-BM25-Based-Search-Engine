measurements at mach numbers up to 2. 8 of the longitudinal characteristics of one plane and three cambered slender 'ogee' wings. measurements have been made of the longitudinal characteristics of one plane and three cambered slender ogee wings (p = 0.45,) at two subsonic and eight supersonic mach numbers up to 2.8. the tests also included measurements of the zero-lift pressure drag and support interference of the plane wing. the results have been analysed to give data for estimating the performance of supersonic transport aircraft.
