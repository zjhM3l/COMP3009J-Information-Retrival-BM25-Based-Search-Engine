lift on inclined bodies of revolution in hypersonic flow. the importance of body lift lies in the fact that at moderate angles of attack and high mach number it can constitute an appreciable part of the total lift of a winged missile. in this paper an attempt has been made to analyze body lift in hypersonic flow by an approximate method and, together with a correlation of existing experimental data, to indicate the probable variation of body lift over a wide range of mach numbers extending from low supersonic to hypersonic. the method of analysis of hypersonic flow over inclined bodies of revolution employed herein has been denoted as the hypersonic approximation. it is an improvement on the newtonian corpuscular theory of aerodynamics, since it considers the centrifugal forces resulting from the curved paths of the air particles in addition to the impact /newtonian/ forces.
