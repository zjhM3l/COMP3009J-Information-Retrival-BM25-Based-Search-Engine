stagnation region in rarefied high mach number flow. paper describes results of numerical solution of the viscous shock-layer equations for axisymmetric stagnation region, using the viscosity-temperature law with w=0.65, pr=0.71 and y=1.25. purpose is to establish applicability of the simple approximation of w=1 (obtained earlier) to air at low reynolds numbers and low ratios of wall temperature to stagnation temperature. using a reference temperature (closely equal to eckert's) to interpret the linear results, excellent agreement is found, in the limit of, over a wide range of reynolds numbers, covering fully merged shock layers as well as boundary layers with and without vorticity interaction. agreement with recent experiments of ferri et al is as good as to be expected from shock-layer approximation. paper provides valuable extension of the applicability of the reference temperature concept.
