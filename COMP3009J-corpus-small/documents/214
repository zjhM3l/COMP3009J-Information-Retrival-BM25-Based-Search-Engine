on the testing of supersonic compressor cascades. to facilitate the development of high speed axial-flow compressors, an investigation was made into the possibility of measuring blade performance in a stationary cascade at supersonic speeds. a suitable technique was developed and the losses in a variety of cascades were measured, but these losses were too high for the blading to have any possible application. it was concluded that if a useful compressor is to result, it is essential to test the cascades at mach numbers close to the existing technique was suitable only for zero incidence tests, and thus a new approach is necessary. some of the fundamentals of this cascade testing at low supersonic speeds are discussed in the light of the current understanding of the mode of operation of supersonic compressors at transonic speeds.
