aerodynamic forces on wings in non-uniform motion. the problem of determining the aerodynamic forces acting on wings of finite span in non-uniform motion in an incompressible, inviscid fluid is investigated. the underlying theory is outlined in 2, and some known results for the case of an aerofoil of infinite span are included in 3. it is shown in 4, by the use of operational methods, that the growth of lift function k (s) corresponding to a sudden unit change of incidence can be derived from the lift function corresponding to simple harmonic translational motion. from results given by the writer for rectangular wings (1943) and tapered wings (1945) in simple harmonic motion the corresponding values of k (s) are determined. the growth of lift function k (s) for a wing penetrating a uniform vertical gust can then be estimated as shown in 4 and 5. by the use of approximate formulae for the growth of lift curves given in fig. 2, the aerodynamic forces corresponding to damped and growing translational oscillations are derived. certain integrals involved in the theory are evaluated in appendix 1, and in appendix 2 the method of determining k (s), when k (s) is known, is discussed in detail. it is suggested that the aerodynamic forces acting on wings of finite span for any type of motion can best be derived from a knowledge of the forces corresponding to purely divergent motion, which can be calculated by the methods outlined in this report.
