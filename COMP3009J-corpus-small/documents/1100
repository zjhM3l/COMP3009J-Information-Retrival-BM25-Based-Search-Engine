an analytical investigation of ablation. an analytical procedure is described which enables the derivation of effective heat of ablation relationships for any type of boundary layer from transpiration cooling results. the procedure enables the inclusion of such effects as the ratio of wall temperature to local stream temperature, surface radiation, and surface combustion. the predicted effective heats of ablation for a three-dimensional laminar stagnation boundary layer for teflon material were in agreement with those derived from tests conducted at boundary-layer enthalpy potentials of 800 and approximately 7,000 btu/lb. the predicted equilibrium surface temperatures on nonablating surfaces behind an ablating material were in agreement with the values derived from tests conducted with inconel cylinders having teflon hemispherical nose pieces.
