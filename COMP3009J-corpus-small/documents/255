an approximate solution of the turbulent boundary layer equations in incompressible and compressible. if over the 'outer region' of the boundary layer, where the mean velocity varies but little from its value outside the shear layer, a virtual eddy viscosity is defined, which is constant over the outer region but varies in the direction of the mainstream, a solution of the turbulent boundary layer equations can be found which satisfies the appropriate boundary conditions. the solution leads to a compatibility condition for the virtual eddy viscosity in terms of the wall shear stress, the boundary layer momentum thickness and the mainstream velocity, at least for the case of a constant external velocity. this compatibility condition, which can be expressed as for moderate to high reynolds numbers, where is the shear velocity, is the boundary layer thickness and is the virtual eddy (kinematic) viscosity, is just the condition townsend (1956) found for the equilibrium of the large eddies. the numerical value of the constant derived by townsend agrees with ours for reynolds numbers (based on x) of about. with this relation for an equation, analoguous to the momentum integral equation solution, can be found for as a function of local freestream velocity, with one disposable parameter.
