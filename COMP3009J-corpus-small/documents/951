a unified theory of creep buckling under normal loads. a general theory of creep buckling, with the initial imperfection as a parameter, is developed for the case of normal loading. a hyperbolic-sine law is used to describe the process of creep. the theory is believed to be applicable to, among other structures, columns, tubes, and possibly conical shells. the wall of the structure is idealized as a sandwich in order to simplify the integration of the equations. experimental data on columns and tubes, from two different sources, are compared with the predictions of the theory.
