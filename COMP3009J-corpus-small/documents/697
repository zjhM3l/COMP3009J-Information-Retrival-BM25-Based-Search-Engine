effects on adjacent surfaces from the firing of rocket jets. this paper is a preliminary and brief account of some research currently being conducted to determine the jet effects on adjacent surfaces from the firing of rocket jets. measurements of jet-effect pressures on a flat plate as well as shadowgraphs are presented that were obtained when a rocket jet at a mach number of 3 was exhausted downstream and upstream into free-stream flow at a mach number of 2 located from 2 to 4.7 rocket-jet-exit diameters from the plate. the jet effects on the flat plate with the rocket jet exhausting downstream are of the same order of magnitude as those previously obtained from sonic exits with a total pressure 10 times lower. a maximum pressure coefficient on the plate of rocket-jet-exit diameters below the plate, and an integration of the measured jet-effect pressures at this position resulted in a normal force on the plate equal to 2.3 times the thrust output of the rocket jet.
