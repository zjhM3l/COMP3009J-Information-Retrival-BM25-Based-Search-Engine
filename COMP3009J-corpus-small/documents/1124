design of missile bodies for minimum drag at very high speeds - thickness ratio, lift, and center of pressure given. newtonian flow theory has been used to develop a procedure for the design of minimum drag bodies of revolution having a given thickness ratio and center of pressure. it is shown that the optimum body shape is independent of lift. center of pressure location, however, exerts a powerful influence on both the shape of the body and on the drag coefficient at zero lift.
