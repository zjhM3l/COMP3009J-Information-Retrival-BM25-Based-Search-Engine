the stacking of compressor stage characteristics to give an overall compressor performance map. a method of calculation is developed to compute the overall performance of a multi-stage axial compressor, from a knowledge of the individual stage characteristics, by a /stacking/ technique. compressor models are designed and their overall performance calculated. these results are compared to show, qualitatively, the effect of alterations in design and stage performance on overall performance and to find how compressors should be designed for optimum performance.
