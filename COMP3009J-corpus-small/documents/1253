hypersonic viscous flow near the stagnation point in the presence of magnetic field. the present study investigates the hypersonic viscous flow past blunt-nosed bodies with hydromagnetic interaction. local-similarity solutions of flow field and temperature distribution are near the stagnation-point region. the discussions may be grouped into two parts.. the two-dimensional problem (circular cylinder) and axisymmetric problem (sphere). numerical computations have been carried out for the sphere problem for the /viscous-layer regime,/ with various magnetic field strengths and electrical conductivities.
