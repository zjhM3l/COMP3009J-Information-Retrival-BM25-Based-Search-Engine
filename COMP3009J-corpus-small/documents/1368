three dimensional viscous wakes. the velocity fields of three-dimensional viscous wakes are examined with the use of the boundary-layer approximations, osoen's linearization of the convective terms, and the assumption of constant fluid properties. transform methods yield solutions for general types of initial conditions. as an illustration, the axial velocity distribution of a wake whose initial isovels (lines of constant velocity) are of elliptic shape and their decay to axial symmetry are demonstrated. both laminar and turbulent flows are considered.
