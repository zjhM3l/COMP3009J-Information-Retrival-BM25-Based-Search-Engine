a correlation of nose-bluntness induced pressures on cylindrical and conical after-bodies at hypersonic speeds. van hise, in his detailed study of the nose-bluntness-induced pressures on cylindrical afterbodies, shows that, starting a few nose diameters aft of the nose-afterbody junction, these pressures are correlated with the parameter as predicted by the blast-wave analogy. chernyi developed a modified form of the blast-wave analogy which takes into account the addition of energy to the flow by a thin afterbody. he showed that for thin afterbodies and hypersonic speeds, the pressure distribution, plotted as should correlate with the parameter. the purpose of this note is to show that the above correlation techniques may be combined into a form such that pressures on cylindrical and conical afterbodies are correlated by one parameter.
