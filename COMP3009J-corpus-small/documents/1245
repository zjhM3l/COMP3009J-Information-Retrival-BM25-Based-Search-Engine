some aspects of nonequilibrium flows. in this paper are discussed some of the general features of nonequilibrium flow. in particular, vibrational relaxation is discussed in detail. this case is somewhat simpler than dissociation and ionization but it illustrates some of the main new features of nonequilibrium flow. those aspects of two-dimensional and axisymmetric flow behind shock waves are examined analytically which yield significant information without requiring numerical solution of the governing equations. the thermodynamics of a vibrational relaxing gas are discussed. the conditions for simulating flows are noted. crocco's theorem and the characteristic equations are derived. then a simple method of obtaining the initial gradients of the flow variables behind a shock is shown. these gradients are used in discussing two particular flows. an exact solution for flow over a cusped body is obtained. flow over a wedge near the tip and far from the tip is considered. it is found that far from the tip a boundary-layer type phenomenon occurs.
