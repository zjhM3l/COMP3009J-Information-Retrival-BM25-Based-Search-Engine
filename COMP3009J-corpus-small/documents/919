theoretical studies of unsteady transonic flow. part iii. the oscillating low aspect ratio rectangular wing. by expanding the velocity potential in an asymptotic series, the aerodynamic forces on an oscillating low aspect ratio rectangular wing are calculated. the approximate theory is valid for small values of ko /o semi-span-to-chord ratio,. k reduced frequency/ and complements an earlier low-aspect-ratio-wing theory by the author valid only for pointed wings like delta wings. the present report gives formulas for the calculation of generalized forces for any smooth, flexible or rigid mode of oscillation with spanwise symmetry. comparisons with the slender-wing theory show that, except for wings of very low aspect ratio, unsteady-flow effects are appreciable even at fairly low reduced frequencies. near the upper limit in ko for the applicability of the present theory good agreement is obtained with a recent theory for high aspect ratios.
