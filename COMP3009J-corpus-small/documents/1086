a note on the numerical solution of fourth order differential equations. an old numerical method of solving fourth order differential equations is put in relaxation form. the higher order correction terms are included and the technique is illustrated by an example. the method has the advantage of being more rapidly convergent than the usual relaxation procedure for fourth order equations. some comments are made on the numerical solution of the viscous flow equation.
