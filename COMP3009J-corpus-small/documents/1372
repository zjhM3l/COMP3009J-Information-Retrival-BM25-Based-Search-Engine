on axially symmetric, turbulent, compressible mixing in the presence of initial boundary layer. recent experimental results have shown that the mixing of heterogeneous gases having an initial velocity ratio close to unity occurs faster than is predicted by classical eddy-viscosity theory. the theoretical analysis of two uniform streams of different gases but of nearly equal velocity, performed with the usual assumptions for eddy viscosity and prandtl number equal to a constant, shows that mixing will take place very slowly, i.e., at the rate corresponding to laminar diffusion. it has been suggested that the difference between analysis and experiment could be attributed to the presence of a boundary layer in the experiments. it is the purpose of this note to show that the use of the classical eddy-viscosity law, admitting the existence of a boundary layer, is not sufficient to explain the rapid mixing that is observed physically. instead, it is shown that rapid mixing can be explained on the basis of a different eddy-viscosity law, as was suggested in ref. 1. these conclusions are obtained through application of the analysis presented briefly below.
