the aerodynamic design of section shapes for swept wings. an extension of work of lock and rogers and the result of cooperation by n.p.l., r.a.e. and members of the british aircraft industry to achieve a satisfactory design for an aircraft cruising at low supersonic speeds. knowledge of shock-wave prediction, onset of wave drag and shock-induced separation allows the basic design to be generalized for a wide range of parameters. unpublished work by bagley on the relation of aerodynamic coefficients and geometry is used. the role of upper surface velocity distribution is noted and methods for predicting pressure distributions with shock waves are reviewed for both subsonic and transonic flows.
