bending of a square plate with two adjacent edges free and the others clamped or simply supported. the title problems were solved for the two cases.. (1) uniform transverse loading, (2) a concentrated force at the free corner. a function is chosen to exactly satisfy the biharmonic equation while the boundary conditions are enforced at a number of points plied at discrete points around the boundary for each of the four problems and the resulting 35 simultaneous equations were solved on an ibm 704. tables listing the values of deflection and bending moments are presented. this paper provides useful information on the solution of these problems which are intractable by analytical methods.
