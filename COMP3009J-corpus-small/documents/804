a flight test investigation of the sonic boom. the /sonic boom/ as it is now popularly called, has become the center of considerable interest during the past few years because of widespread public disturbance and possible damage that can result from it. in the hopes of minimizing this disturbance and to extend the general knowledge of the shock waves which produce the booming noise, the aeronautical research laboratory, wright air development center, has initiated an extensive research program to study the sonic boom phenomenon. this report presents the results of flight tests undertaken as one phase of this program. the tests had as their objective the determination and measurement of the shock wave pressure pattern surrounding an f-100 aircraft in level supersonic flight. the flight tests were conducted at the air force flight test center, edwards air force base, california, under the authority of air research and development command test directive no. 5524-f1.
