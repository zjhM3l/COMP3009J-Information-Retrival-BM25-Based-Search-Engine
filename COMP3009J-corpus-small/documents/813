the motion of rolling symmetrical missiles referred to a body-axis system. the linearized equations of motion have been derived for a rolling missile having slight aerodynamic asymmetries. time histories of rolling-missile motions referred to a body-axis system have been prepared to show the types of missile motions that can be encountered. the motions resulting from a trim change and a pulse-rocket disturbance are shown to be determined mainly by the ratio of rolling velocity to pitching frequency. finally, the derived equations are used in establishing a technique for the reduction of rolling-missile oscillation data. it is shown that the aerodynamic derivatives can be obtained from flight data if four accelerations are measured. the method is applied to the results obtained from a flight test of a missile configuration.
