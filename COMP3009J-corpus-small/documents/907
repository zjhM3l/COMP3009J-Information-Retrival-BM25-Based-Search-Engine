cavitation and pressure distribution head forms at zero angle of yaw. early in the fall of 1943 the iowa institute of hydraulic research undertook the design and fabrication of a variable-pressure water tunnel. as the tunnel neared completion, however, its immediate use for the study of the pressure distribution around various body forms was requested. the original request for this investigation was a natural out-growth of the need for systematic data on the distribution of pressure in flow around various bodies, particularly under conditions leading to cavitation, information which is desirable for the design of a wide variety of navy equipment. ultimately the study is to include data for two- and three-dimensional head and tail forms at various angles of yaw. the first phase of the study, namely the investigation of three-dimensional head forms at zero angle of yaw, is described herein. three general geometric series have been studied.dash rounded, ellipsoidal, and conical.dash together with other related forms. the data obtained have been systematized to yield information for a wide variety of geometrical forms either directly or by interpolation. whenever possible, analytical methods have been used to corroborate the experimental data and to provide a reliable means of generalizing the results.
