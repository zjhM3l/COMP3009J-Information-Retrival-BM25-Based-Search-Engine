calculated lift distributions in incompressible flow on some sweptback wings. in the course of a larger survey of some aerodynamic characteristics of a family of sweptback wings, the low-speed lift distributions were calculated. the 35 planforms considered cover a range of leading-edge sweep angles from 55 to 70, and aspect ratios from 2 to 3.9. the results are given here, together with a comparison with other calculations and with experimental results on one particular wing.
