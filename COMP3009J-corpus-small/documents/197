pressure distributions on three bodies of revolution to determine the effect of reynolds number up to and including the transonic speed range. this paper presents the results of an investigation conducted in the langley 16-foot transonic tunnel to determine the effects of varying reynolds number on the pressure distribution on a transonic body of revolution at angles of attack through the transonic speed range. the effect of a change in sting cone angle on the pressure distributions and a comparison of experimental incremental pressures with theory is also included. the models were tested through a mach number range from 0.60 to 1.09. the reynolds number range based on body length was from 9 x 10 to 39 x diameter was 1.3 x 10 to 4.53 x 10 for the model at 8 angle of attack. an increase in reynolds number from 9 x 10 to 39 x 10 affected the longitudinal pressure distributions very slightly. these effects were of such a nature as to cause an increase of 0.05 in the normal-force coefficient of the body when tested in the subcritical cross-flow reynolds number range. this increase is in agreement with theoretical approximations. a comparison between experimental and theoretical values of the incremental pressure coefficient due to angle of attack indicated good agreement except at angles where separated flow areas existed over the body. the effect of a change in sting-cone angle from 5 to 9 on the pressure distribution of the 120-inch model was negligible up to a mach number of 1.05. at this mach number the effect was to cause a small increase in the velocity over the rear of the body.
