the compressible laminar boundary layer with heat transfer and arbitrary pressure gradient. an approximate method for the calculation of the compressible laminar boundary layer with heat transfer and arbitrary pressure gradient, based on thwaites' correlation concept, is presented. the method results from the application of stewartson's transformation to prandtl's equations, which yeilds a nonlinear set of two first-order differential equations. these equations are then expressed in terms of dimensionless parameters related to the wall shear, the surface heat transfer, and the transformed free-stream velocity. thwaites' concept of the unique interdependence of these parameters is assumed. the evaluation of these quantities is then carried out by utilizing exact solutions recently obtained. with the resulting relations, methods are derived for the calculation of the two-dimensional and axially symmetric laminar boundary layer with arbitrary free-stream velocity distribution. mach number, and surface temperature level. the combined effect of heat transfer and pressure gradient is demonstrated by applying the method to calculate the characteristics of the boundary layer on thin supersonic surfaces and in a highly cooled, convergent-divergent, axially symmetric rocket nozzle.
