similar solutions in compressible laminar free mixing problems. there are in supersonic aerodynamics many situations of practical interest wherein streams of different velocities and, in general, different stagnation pressures mix with one another. in the majority of these problems the interaction between the two streams takes place in the presence of an axial pressure gradient. its effect on the characteristics of the mixing may influence significantly the performances of the devices wherein the phenomena cited above occur. a theoretical and experimental program of research to study mixing in the presence of axial pressure gradients is being carried on at the polytechnic institute of brooklyn.
