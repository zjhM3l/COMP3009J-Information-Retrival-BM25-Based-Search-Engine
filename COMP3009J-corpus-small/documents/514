pressure distributions and flow patterns on some conical shapes with sharp edges and symmetrical cross-sections at m=4.0. results are given of a wind tunnel programme made to study the pressure distributions and flow patterns over a series of simple, conical shapes at a mach number of 4.0. the results have been compared with various approximate theories and the limitations of these theories are discussed. it is found that at this mach number leading edge separations still have an influence on the suction surface pressure, and that this surface still makes a significant contribution to the overall forces.
