critical shear stress of an infinitely long simply supported plate with transverse stiffeners. a theoretical solution is given for the critical shear stress of an infinitely long, simply supported, flat plate with identical, equally spaced, transverse stiffeners of zero torsional stiffness. results are obtained by means of the lagrangian multiplier method and are presented in the form of design charts. experimental results are included and are found to be in good agreement with the theoretical results.
