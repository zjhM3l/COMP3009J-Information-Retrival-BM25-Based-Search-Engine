general instability of ring stiffened cylindrical shells subject to external hydrostatic pressure - a comparison of theory and experiment. tests are described of a number of machined-stiffened cylinders subjected to external hydrostatic pressure, and the observed general instability strengths compared with predictions from theories of kendrick and nash. agreement with kendrick was found rather good. results also are presented from electrical strain gages which show in detail the growth of embryonic lobes and nonlinear characteristics of deformation at the threshold of buckling. weakening effects of imperfect circularity are discussed.
