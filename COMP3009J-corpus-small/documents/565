similar solutions for the compressible boundary layer on a yawed cylinder with transpiration cooling. heat-transfer and skin-friction parameters obtained from exact numerical solutions to the laminar compressible-boundary-layer equations for the infinite cylinder in yaw are presented. the chordwise flow in the transformed plane is of the falkner-skan type. solutions are given for chordwise stagnation flow with both a porous and a nonporous wall. the effect of a linear viscosity-temperature relation is compared with the effect of the sutherland viscosity-temperature relation at the stagnation line of the cylinder for a prandtl number of 0.7. the effects of pressure gradient, mach number, yaw angle, and wall temperature are investigated for a linear viscosity-temperature relation and a prandtl number of 1.0 with a nonporous wall. the results indicate that compressibility effects become important at large mach numbers and yaw angles, with larger percentage effects on the skin friction than on the heat transfer. the use of the two different viscosity relations gives about the same results except when large changes in temperature occur across the boundary layer, as for a highly cooled wall. the present solutions predict that a larger amount of coolant would be required at a given large mach number and yaw angle than would be predicted from solutions of the corresponding incompressible-boundary-layer equations.
