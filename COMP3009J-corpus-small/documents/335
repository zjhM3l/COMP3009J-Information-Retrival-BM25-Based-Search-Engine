the interaction between boundary layer and shock waves in transonic flow. experiments of transonic flow past a circular arc profile show that the shock-wave pattern and the pressure distribution are strongly dependent upon the state of the boundary layer. a change from laminar to turbulent boundary layer at a given mach number changes the flow pattern considerably. shock waves can interact with the boundary layer in a manner similar to a reflection from a free jet boundary. these shock waves are not distinctly discernible from pressure distribution measurements.
