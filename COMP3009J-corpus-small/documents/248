the application of lighthill formula for numerical calculation of pressure distributions on bodies of revolution at supersonic speed and zero angle of attack. an integral expression, given by lighthill and based on linearized theory, for the external supersonic flow over the surface of slender pointed or ducted bodies of revolution at zero angle of attack is shown to give a good approximation of the exact flow for a much wider mach number and thickness range than could be expected from linearized theory. a numerical method, based on this expression, is developed and applied for digital computing. some results from applying the digital computing procedure for determining the pressure distribution and wave drag for various bodies of revolution are given.
