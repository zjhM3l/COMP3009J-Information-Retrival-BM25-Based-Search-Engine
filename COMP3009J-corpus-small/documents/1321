effects of a flexible boundary on hydrodynamic stability. purpose of paper is to examine theoretically the use of coatings of elastic materials to prevent transition from laminar to turbulent flow. theory is extension to flexible boundary of the small-disturbance tollmien-schlichting stability theory and makes use of /tietjens function/ and other functions that occur in solution of orr-sommerfeld equation. it is shown how solutions for flexible wall can be obtained from solutions for rigid boundary. outline and discussion is given first for tollmien-schlichting stability theory for rigid wall, then for theory for flexible boundary. theory is given both for a nondissipative and a dissipative flexible boundary. behavior of flexible medium itself is also examined. practical requirements are discussed. for example, a conclusion is that to avoid tollmien-schlichting instability, the wave velocity of surface waves in absence of flow should coincide with tollmien-schlichting wave velocity at wavelength of /most dangerous/ tollmien-schlichting waves. moreover, damping should be large enough to prevent surface waves from developing but not so large that tollmien-schlichting waves are permissable. author states that a boundary that is both soft and light, one whose elastic constants are of same order as the dynamic pressure of the flow, may be practical for use at high speeds. this surface should have a small damping to avoid tollmien-schlichting type of instability and a large enough wave speed without flow to avoid surface wave instability. although paper is somewhat sketchy in places, it gives comprehensive coverage of stability of laminar flow over a flexible wall.
