heat transfer in planetary atmospheres at super-satellite speeds. the main purpose of this investigation is to examine the dependence of heat transfer in planetary atmospheres on the total enthalpy up to flight velocities of 50,000 ft/sec where a large proportion of the atoms are ionized. the /total thermodynamic and transport property/ concept discussed by hirshfelder /j.chem.phys.,26/2/,feb.,1957/ is used.
