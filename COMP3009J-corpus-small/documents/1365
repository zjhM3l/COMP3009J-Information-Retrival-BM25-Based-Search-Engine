approximate calculation of the laminar boundary layer. after analyzing a large class of boundary-layer velocity-profiles, the author discovered that the functions l(m) and h(m) for all such cases differ only slightly from each other over the whole range of positive and negative pressure gradients. here l, m and h are defined by being the velocity-component in the x direction and u the value of u at the edge of the boundary-layer and and the displacement and momentum thickness, respectively. based on this discovery, an approximate method is proposed by constructing two universal curves l(m) and h(m) for all conceivable boundary-layer flows found in practice. once these are chosen, karman's momentum-integral can be written in the form, v being the kinematic viscosity coefficient, and can be integrated numerically. as examples, both howarth's and hartree's tained is considered good for practical purposes.
