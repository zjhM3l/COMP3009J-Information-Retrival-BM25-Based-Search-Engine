limit analysis of symmetrically loaded thin shells of revolution. the yield surface for a thin cylindrical shell is shown to be a very good approximation to the yield surface for any symmetrically loaded thin shell of revolution. hexagonal prism approximations to this yield surface, appropriate for pressure vessel analysis, are described and discussed in terms of limit analysis. procedures suitable for finding upper and lower bounds on the limit pressure for the complete vessel are developed and evaluated. they are applied for illustration to a portion of a toroidal zone or knuckle held rigidly at the two bounding planes. the combined end force and moment which can be carried by an unflanged cylinder also is discussed.
