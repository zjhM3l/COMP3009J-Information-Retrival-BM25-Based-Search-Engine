inelastic buckling of initially imperfect cylindrical shells subject to axial compression. an analytical and experimental study is made for inelastic instability of initially imperfect cylindrical shells subject to axial compression. donnell's equations and the principle of virtual work are adapted to determine the effects of initial imperfections on the buckling modes and the critical buckling stresses. the deformation theory and the incremental theory of plastic stress-strain relationships are both considered. the experimental results of ten tests on specimens made of aluminum alloy 3003-0 are presented. comparison of experimental with theoretical results indicates that the application of the deformation theory provides a fairly accurate prediction of buckling strength, but fails in this case to yield a correct description of post-buckling behavior. on the other hand, the application of the incremental theory, which is mathematically and physically more rigorous, leads to an overestimation of buckling strength, even though initial imperfections are considered. this paradox has existed for years, and remains to be resolved.
