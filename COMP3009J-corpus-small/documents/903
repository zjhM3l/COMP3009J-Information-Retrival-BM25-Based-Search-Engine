two dimensional transonic unsteady flow with shock waves. a study is made of the unsteady flow around an airfoil at transonic mach numbers, the situation being such that local supersonic regions terminated by shock-waves are present in the vicinity of the airfoil. for the unsteady part of the flow, small perturbations technique is employed and the interaction with the shock wave is taken into account. the case of an oscillating aileron is considered first, and a solution is derived for the pressure distribution on the aileron. it is found that the solution has a simple form when the shock-wave is well ahead of the hinge axis of the aileron. as the shock approaches the hinge-axis a correction must be added to the solution. an interpretation of these results is given. the results are compared with results of a theory which neglects the presence of the shock and it is found that both agree for m = 1. for m 1, however, neglecting the presence of the shock waves introduces errors of the order of magnitude (1 - m), where m is the local mach number behind the shock. the theory is finally extended to include the case in which the whole airfoil oscillates, but only the solution for the subsonic region behind the shock is treated. the role of the unsteady shock-boundary layer interaction is discussed and it is shown that this mechanism can be included in the results of the present theory.
