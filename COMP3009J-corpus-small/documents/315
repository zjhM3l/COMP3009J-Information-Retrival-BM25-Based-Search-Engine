scale effects at high subsonic and transonic speeds and methods for fixing transition in model experiments. the major scale effects at high subsonic and transonic speeds arise from differences between the conditions under which laminar and turbulent boundary layers separate, and in how they behave after separation. for turbulent boundary layers, these conditions and behaviour do not vary greatly as the reynolds number is changed and in many examples, it has been shown that they are similar for the turbulent layers that occur naturally at high reynolds number and for boundary layers in which transition to turbulent flow is fixed artificially. the scale effects arising in wind-tunnel tests made at low reynolds number may, therefore, often be minimised by fixing transition to turbulent flow by introducing an artificial disturbance such as that produced by excrescences attached to the surface. the fact that the effects of separation are often less severe for laminar layers than for the turbulent layers that are likely to be encountered at full scale, makes it all the more important to do this whenever possible. several methods which can be used to fix transition are described, and the results obtained by using them are compared. in general, in experiments in two-dimensional flow, good agreement is found, and explanations can be advanced for cases in which discrepancies occur. several uncertainties and difficulties that arise in fixing transition are discussed and illustrated by examples. in particular, special care is needed in interpreting the results obtained with transition fixed at very low reynolds numbers (say, less than about r = 1 x 10 based on local chord for wings of about 0.1 thickness chord ratio and possibly higher reynolds numbers for thinner wings). the difficulties of fixing transition satisfactorily are increased for three-dimensional wings, particularly if they are swept-back or highly tapered (i.e., small chord and reynolds number near the tip) and if the tests cover a large range of incidence including high incidences for which the flow may separate from very close to the leading edge. under these circumstances, it is frequently necessary to place the excrescences at different chordwise positions for low and high angles of incidence, and this is inconvenient in practice. more research is needed before sound recommendations can be made as to how and where transition should be fixed on such models, particularly since in routine testing, it is often not possible to check the effects of transition-fixing fully. in the sections dealing with three-dimensional tests, examples are given of the spurious results that have been avoided successfully by fixing transition, of the conditions where even at low reynolds numbers artificial fixing of transition may not be necessary to give a turbulent boundary layer ahead of the shock, and of the conditions under which there are some doubts whether the methods used for fixing transition have been satisfactory.
