structural acoustic proof testing. with the introduction of high-powered propulsion systems, and paralleling their continued development, an accompanying increase in acoustical problems has arisen. of these acoustical problems, that of acoustical fatigue failures has become paramount in the eyes of the structural engineer. aircraft designed to normal strength requirements have been known literally to fall apart under acoustical loading. this problem has required much endeavour to produce a solution, and considerable structural research, based upon results of siren or other testing, have proved inadequate. this failure to find a satisfactory solution has resulted in the conviction that the final proof of a design can be found only in proof testing. proof testing, in the acoustic fatigue sense, is the testing of a design structure in a simulated acoustical environment for a period of time long enough to assure equality with design life.
