of a turbulent free shear layer. the problem of predicting the mean velocity on streamlines through the pre-asymptotic turbulent free shear layer in two-dimensional incompressible flow is resolved into two parts. the linearized momentum equation in terms of a generalized axial co-ordinate is solved in the usual way. a relation between and the distance from the separation point is then established analytically in contrast to the previous use of empirical expressions. it is shown that except in the region close to separation the velocity on the streamlines can be predicted by the simple approximation proposed by kirk.
