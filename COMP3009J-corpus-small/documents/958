air scooping vehicle. a satellite vehicle is described which collects gases from the upper atmosphere and stores them in liquid form. such a vehicle could serve as a filling station in space, furnishing liquid oxygen or air to other spacecraft. the vehicle represents an alternative to launching these liquids into orbit from the surface of the earth. the two methods are compared on an economic basis, and it is shown that the proposed vehicle permits substantial savings when operated beyond about one year. the feasibility of developing such a system for long-time operation is investigated. several practical designs are discussed.
