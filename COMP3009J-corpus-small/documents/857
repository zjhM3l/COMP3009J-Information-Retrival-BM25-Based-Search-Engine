experimental studies of flutter of buckled rectangular panels at mach numbers from 1. 2 to 3. 0 including effects of pressure differential and of panel width-length ratio. experimental panel flutter data have been obtained at mach numbers from 1.2 to 3.0 for buckled rectangular panels and the effect of a pressure differential has been determined. increasing the pressure differential was effective in eliminating flutter on most of the panels tested. the effects of the variables in the panel flutter parameter sure, e is young's modulus, and t and l are the panel thickness and length, respectively) were investigated for buckled panels clamped on the front and rear edges and a critical value of this parameter of 0.44 is indicated at zero pressure differential when the panel width-length ratio is 0.69. an estimated flutter boundary is presented for buckled panels clamped on four edges, with width-length ratios of 0.21 to 4.0. this boundary shows that the panel width is more significant than the panel length when the ratio of width to length is less than approximately 0.5. panels clamped on four edges and buckled in two half waves in the direction of flow were found to be particularly susceptible to flutter. the results of limited tests on panels with applied damping, curvature, and lengthwise stiffeners are also presented and discussed.
