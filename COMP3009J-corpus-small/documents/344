some experimental techniques in mass transfer cooling. author introduces his survey by a brief review of the history of investigations dealing with boundary layers on impermeable solid surfaces, and notes that no true theory exists for turbulent boundary layers, the success of studies in this area having been due to the introduction of artificial, if ingenious, assumptions which permitted empirical correlations fd data. the terminology introduced by the author for distinguishing the different situations involving mass transfer from the wall to the stream may give rise to some objections. for instance, /film cooling/ need not refer only to the injection of a liquid, since applications involving gas film cooling exist. also, his restriction of the term /transpiration cooling/ to refer to the injection through a porous surface of a gas only of the same composition as the exterior stream does not enjoy universal usage. the influence of mass transfer on heat transfer through laminar boundary layers and on the transition from laminar to turbulent flow is described, with consideration given to the question of the net effect of the stabilizing influence of surface cooling and the destabilizing influence of injection. reviewer suggests that author's inaccurate statement to the effect that /thus far the higher energy conditions do not threaten to involve turbulent injection, so turbulent boundary-layer research enjoys a fairly academic serenity broken only by its own frustrations/ be excused on grounds of poetic license, although it ignores the efforts being devoted to the pressing practical problems of erosive burning of solid propellants (possibly the most common example of a complete /aerothermochemical/ problem involving distributed surface heat and mass transfer with chemical reaction in a flow system) and of effusion cooling of rocket nozzles, both of which involve turbulent boundary-layer conditions. author emphasizes the tedious experimental problems involved in research on boundary layers with blowing, and notes the desirability of velocity distribution measurements, especially in turbulent injection layers. the observation that no good data on concentration profiles in the case of the diffusion boundary layer have been published may be an overstatement, since author's bibliography overlooks the work of j. berger (/contribution a l'etude de l'injection parietale,/ doctor's thesis, university of paris, memorial des poudres 38 (annex), p. 1,. paris, imprimerie nationale, 1956).
