slender not-so-thin wing theory. a method for making an approximate thickness correction to slender thin-wing theory is presented. the method is tested by applying it to cones with rhombic cross-sections and the agreement is found to be good if the cones are not too thick. it is then suggested that the thickness correction to slender thin-wing theory may be applied unchanged to linear thin-wing theory. this suggestion is compared with some experiments on delta wings and it is found that there is considerable improvement over thin-wing theory near the centre line, but that this improvement is not maintained as the wing tips are approached.
