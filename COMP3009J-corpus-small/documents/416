methods of boundary-layer control for postponing and alleviating buffeting and other effects of shock-induced separation. the use of boundary-layer control to increase the separation-free margins of mach number and lift coefficient beyond the cruise point of high-speed aircraft may often be preferred to design changes that impair the cruising performance or the landing and take-off characteristics. the factors that influence the choice of method and details of its application are discussed, emphasising particularly the need to maintain effectiveness over most of the chord to cover the wide range of separation positions encountered as the shock moves over the wing with changing flight conditions. research at the national physical laboratory that has embraced high-velocity blowing, vane and air-jet vortex generators, and, in a preliminary way, distributed suction, is briefly described. the relative merits of the various methods are discussed, and some results achieved in their application are given. for vortex generators, the importance is stressed of the vortex paths determined by the interactions of neighbouring vortices and their images. thus, systems of counter-rotating vortices always leave the surface in pairs and lose their effectiveness. co-rotating systems are therefore preferred for many applications. blowing, which in wind-tunnel tests gives results as good as or better than vortex generators and does not have the disadvantage of a drag penalty at cruise, has not yet been assessed in flight. air-jet vortex generators, which would also avoid the drag penalty, show promise of producing significant effects with relatively small blowing pressures and quantities.
