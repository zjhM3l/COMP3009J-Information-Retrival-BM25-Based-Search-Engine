stability of orthotropic cylindrical shells under combined loading. the increasing use of fiber and whisker reinforced materials makes necessary the availability of methods of analyzing cylinders and cones composed of an orthotropic material. this paper treats the buckling of such shells under a combination of axial compression and uniform external pressure. the differential equation approach of flugge is used, and the resulting buckling equation is presented in terms of axial and circumferential bending rigidities, shear rigidity, poisson's ratio, geometry parameters and mode shapes. design curves are presented which allow quick determination of critical loads on cylinders, and, by using the equivalent cylinder concept, on conical shells of small included angle. the curves also lend themselves to /tailoring/ of materials to fit the load carrying requirements of the structure.
