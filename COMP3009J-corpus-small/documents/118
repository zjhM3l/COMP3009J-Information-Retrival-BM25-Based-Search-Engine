the transonic flow of a compressible fluid through an axially symmetrical nozzle. by a method similar to that developed by s. tomotika and k. tamada (quart. appl. math. 7, 381-397 (1950),. these rev. 11, 275) for computing two-dimensional mixed isentropic flows in the sonic region, the flow in the vicinity of the throat of an axially symmetrical nozzle is studied. several exact solutions to von karman's equation for axially symmetrical transonic flows are obtained and the one that gives flows through a converging and diverging nozzle is considered in detail. this solution consists of four branches of which two are rejected because of singularities. of the remaining two branches, one gives pure supersonic flow and the other gives taylor's type of flow with a local supersonic region in the throat. by varying a parameter, the latter branch approaches two asymptotes which yield meyer's type of asymmetrical flows.
