an electronic apparatus for automatic recording of the logarithmic decrement and frequency for oscillations in the audio and subaudio frequency range. an electronic apparatus for automatic evaluation of the damping of a harmonic oscillation has been designed and constructed. the apparatus is based on the idea of representing the harmonic damped oscillation by a rotating vector on the screen of a cathode-ray tube in such a way, that the rate of decrease of the length of the vector is a measure of the damping. the results are obtained simultaneously with the oscillation test as two numbers in decimal digits, which are inversely proportional to the logarithmic decrement and the frequency, respectively. the apparatus, which is named the /dampometer/, has been used for some time for free oscillation measurements of the dynamic stability derivatives of aeroplane models in windtunnels, and has proved to be very satisfactory. it gives results of usually higher accuracy than evaluation methods in common use, and permits a most considerable saving of time.
