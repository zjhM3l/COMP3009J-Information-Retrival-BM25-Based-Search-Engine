note on the hypersonic similarity law for an unyawed cone. it is now known that the hypersonic similarity law derived for slender cones and ogival bodies under the assumption, is applicable for mach numbers as low as 3. this note makes use of a series development to infer the hypersonic similarity law for unyawed cones from the taylor-maccoll differential equations and associated boundary conditions. a simple approximate formula for the function of the similarity law is obtained, and the drag function computed with this formula is compared with kopal's numerical results and, for very slender cones, with von karman's linearized formula.
