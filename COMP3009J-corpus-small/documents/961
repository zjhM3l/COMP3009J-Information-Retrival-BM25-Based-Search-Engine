compressible two dimensional jet mixing at constant pressure. an analysis is made of turbulent constant pressure mixing for a compressible jet boundary, taking into consideration effects of the initial boundary layer. velocity profiles in the mixing region are represented in a transformed plans by one-parameter families of curves, with no specification for the mixing mechanism beyond that of an exchange coefficient concept being made. the exchange coefficient is represented by the bornel function of an integral transform for the x coordinate of an intrinsic system of coordinates. this intrinsic system and the physical coordinate system are related by means of a momentum integral. satisfactory correlation of theory and experimental low-speed data is obtained with a simple form of kernal function. an asymptotic solution, corresponding to a fully developed velocity profile in the jet boundary, allows the calculation of the mechanical energy level along the separating streamline in the jet boundary without the use of empirical information.
