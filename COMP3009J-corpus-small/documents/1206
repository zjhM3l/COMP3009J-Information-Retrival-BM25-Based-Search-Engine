magnetohydrodynamic mach cones. features of the surfaces of main disturbance created by a small object in steady motion through a conducting fluid are examined. these surfaces are found by drawing tangent cones from the object to the relevant wave-front diagrams. the outer wave cone (when present) is smooth, but the two inner cones have cross sections similar to the cusped figures of the inner wave-front diagram. it is conjectured that the disturbance may be concentrated along such line cusps. this has particular relevance in the application of known two-dimensional results to three-dimensional problems, say in the well-known techniques of aerodynamics. in mhd the omission of the large disturbance characteristics implicit in a two-dimensional solution may invalidate its use in any practical three-dimensional problem.
