free-flight measurements of the static and dynamic. equations based on newtonian impact theory have been derived and a computational procedure developed with the aid of several design-type charts which enable the determination of the aerodynamic forces and moments acting on arbitrary bodies of revolution undergoing either separate or combined angle-of-attack and pitching motions. bodies with axially increasing and decreasing cross-sectional area distributions are considered,. nose shapes may be sharp, blunt, or flat faced. the analysis considers variations in angle of attack from -90 to 90 and allows for both positive and negative pitching rates of arbitrary magnitude. the results are also directly applicable to bodies in either separate or combined sideslip and yawing maneuvers.
