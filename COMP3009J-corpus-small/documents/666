blunt body heat transfer at hypersonic speed and low reynolds numbers. an analytical method for the determination of effect of shock curvature on heat transfer in the region of the nose has been developed. it is shown that for practical body shape the viscous terms in the navier-stokes equations are not important in the region of the flow far from the wall, and the displacement thickness can be neglected. then the flow can be approximately represented by an inviscid-flow solution having as boundary conditions the body shape, which is not affected by the reynolds number, and by a boundary-layer type of flow near the wall, having appropriate boundary conditions. this approach permits us to determine the heat transfer in the region of the nose even at very low reynolds numbers. experimental results are presented. the experimental results agree with the values given by the analysis.
