loads induced on a flat plate wing by an air jet exhausting perpendicularly through the wing and normal to a free-stream flow of mach number 2.0. measurements were made of loads induced on a flat-plate wing by an air jet exhausting perpendicularly through the wing and normal to the free-stream flow. the investigation was conducted at a free-stream mach number of 2.0 and a reynolds number per foot of 14.4 x 10. an axially symmetric sonic nozzle and two supersonic nozzles were employed for the jets. the supersonic nozzles consisted of an axially symmetric nozzle with exit mach number of 3.44 and a two-dimensional nozzle with exit mach number of 1.76. the ratio of nozzle total pressure to free-stream static pressure was varied from 20 to 110. negative loads were induced on the flat-plate wing by all the jets. as the nozzle pressure ratio was increased the magnitude of interference loads due to jet thrust decreased. the chordwise center-of-pressure location generally moved toward the nozzle center line as the pressure ratio was increased.
