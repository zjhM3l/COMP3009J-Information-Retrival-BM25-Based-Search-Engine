the extent of the jet interference flow fields. jet effects on cylindrical afterbodies housing sonic and supersonic nozzles which exhaust against a supersonic stream at angles of attack from 90degree to 180degree. an investigation has been made to determine jet effects on cylindrical afterbodies housing sonic and supersonic nozzles which exhaust against a supersonic stream at angles of attack from 90 to 180. the tests were conducted at a free-stream mach number of 2.91 and at free-stream reynolds numbers, based on body diameter, of 0.15x106 and stream static pressure investigated was from jet off to about 400. the data presented herein showed that, in general, variation of the ratio of jet total pressure to free-stream static pressure, jet-exit mach number, and ratio of jet-exit diameter to body diameter had large influences on the body pressures on the windward halves of the after-bodies and negligible influences on the leeward pressures. there was a negligible effect of reynolds number on the body pressures. the ratio of jet total pressure to free-stream static pressure also had a large influence on the base pressures at all angles of attack. schlieren studies showed details of the shock-wave structure caused by the jet and the extent of the jet interference flow fields.
