on supersonic flow past thick airfoils. the inviscid rotational supersonic flow behind the shock wave attached to the sharp leading edge of an airfoil is studied by a transformation of coordinates which introduces the crocco stream function as an independent variable. using expansions in the power series of, an iterative process is developed for the determination of pressure distribution along the airfoil surface.
