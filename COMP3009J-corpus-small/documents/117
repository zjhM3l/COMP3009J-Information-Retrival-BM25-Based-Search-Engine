the motion of a viscous liquid past a paraboloid. an approximate solution for the steady flow of incompressible viscous liquid past a paraboloid of revolution is described. an assumption is made for the form of the stokes stream function and substituted into the navier-stokes equations using paraboloidal coordinates. after making suitable approximations, a non-linear differential equation for a function f is deduced. the solutions of this equation depend on the reynolds number of the flow considered. examples found by numerical integration are given to illustrate the properties of the function f for reynolds numbers varying from 0.0001 to is found, and it is shown that this approximate solution tends to the perfect fluid flow away from the boundary, allowance being made for the displacement effect of what may be called the boundary layer.
