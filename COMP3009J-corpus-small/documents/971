surface pressure distributions with a sonic jet normal to adjacent flat surfaces at mach 2.92 to 6.4. an investigation was made to determine the interference effects on surface pressure distributions caused by a sonic jet exiting normal to the surface. two configurations, a flat plate and an arrow-wing reentry-type vehicle, with sonic nozzles near the leading edge were tested over a range of pressure ratios and reynolds numbers for mach numbers from the data indicate that jet pressure ratio had considerable effect on the pressure levels and distributions on both configurations. also, for a constant jet pressure ratio, the free-stream mach number effect on the distributions and levels was quite large. over the limited range investigated, the effect of reynolds number at constant mach number and pressure ratio was small compared to the mach number and pressure ratio effect.
