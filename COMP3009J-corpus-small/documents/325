heat transfer to constant property laminar boundary layer flows with power function free stream velocity and wall temperature variation. numerical computations have been performed for the boundary-layer form of the energy equation for incompressible flows with power-function variation of free-stream velocity (u = cx) and of wall temperature (t = ax), the pertinent solutions of the momentum equation in this case being those of hartree. the numerical computations given herein are to some extent a repetition of those given by schuh and by chapman and rubesin, the object of the present computations being the resolution of discrepancies appearing in the previous solutions and an extension of their range. ibm machine calculations were employed in the finite difference calculation presently utilized, the results thereof covering a range of wall-temperature function exponents from values of m(4, 1, 0, -0.0904). the accuracy of the numerical computations is examined in detail, and the accuracy of the computed functions at the wall, which determine the heat-transfer rate, is estimated to be within 2 per cent. examination of the results reveals that the results of schuh for the flat plate are in error. for the range of the calculations, it was found that the local heat-transfer coefficient can, with the exception of large negative values, be expressed within 5 per cent as where the exponent of the prandtl number varies from 0.254 to 0.367 for -0.0904 and where the function can be approximated by the equation
