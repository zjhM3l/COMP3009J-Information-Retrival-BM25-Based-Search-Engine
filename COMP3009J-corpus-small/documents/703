general airfoil theory. on the assumption of infinitely small disturbances the author develops a generalized integral equation of airfoil theory which is applicable to any motion and compressible fluid. successive specializations yield various simpler integral equations, such as possio's, birnbaum's, and prandtl's integral equations, as well as new ones for the wing of infinite span with periodic downwash distribution and for the oscillating wing with high aspect ratio. lastly, several solutions and methods for solving these integral equations are given.
