free-flight measurements of the static and dynamic. charts of thermodynamic properties for equilibrium air are presented with sufficient accuracy to permit the calculation of flow parameters in hypersonic nozzles operating at stagnation temperatures up to 4,950 r and pressures up to 1,000 atm. flow parameters calculated from these charts are presented for a series of stagnation temperatures between use of these parameters, it is possible to calibrate a nozzle in the conventional way. a method is also presented from which the flow parameters for conditions other than those chosen herein may be calculated. real-gas effects on the calculation of a hypersonic nozzle contour are shown by an example calculation in which the nozzle contour for mach number 12 was determined by including real-gas effects, and this contour was compared with one calculated by ideal-gas considerations. also presented are the approximate limiting mach numbers at which equilibrium air will just condense for various combinations of stagnation temperatures and pressures.
