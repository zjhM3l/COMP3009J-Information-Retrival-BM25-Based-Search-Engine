secondary flow fields embedded in hypersonic shock layers. when a ramp or other compression surface is located in a locally supersonic region behind a hypersonic bow shock wave, it generates a secondary shock wave. the ramp flow disturbance may be viewed as an embedded newtonian impact flow if the embedded shock layer is thin. examination of the applicability of newtonian flow theory to cones and wedges in uniform streams suggests that this theory can be expected to give a useful approximation to the surface pressures. a pressure equation based on this concept predicts a number of interesting things.. first, pressures can differ from simple newtonian theory by factors of 1 5 to 3,. for example, on flare stabilizers on blunt-nosed bodies of revolution, pressures are lower than newtonian and diminish with increasing flight speed in the hypersonic speed range. the calculated pressures vary over the flare surface as a result of the nonuniformity of its incident stream, and depend on the axial location of the flare. in the case of a flap mounted on a large-angled blunt-nosed cone, the pressure coefficients vary from 1 to 5 through the variable entropy layer. a pressure coefficient of 5 greater than the maximum possible in newtonian flow can occur because the compression process is more efficient than a single shock wave process. on areas of the flap that protrude through the main bow wave, the pressure coefficient should revert to the simple newtonian value. equations are developed for the initial slopes of the normal-force and pitching-moment curves of a flare stabilizer. in the simplest case these differ from conventional newtonian theory by the ratio of local dynamic pressure to free-stream dynamic pressure. this ratio takes values as low as 0.1 in some of the examples considered.
