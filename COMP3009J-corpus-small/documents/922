supersonic flow past slender bodies of revolution, slope of whose median section is discontinuous. the theory of supersonic flow around slender bodies of revolution, yawed or unyawed, with pointed or open bows, based on the linearized equation, is extended to the case when the meridian section of the outer surface has discontinuities in slope. expressions for the pressure distribution on the surface are obtained. it is found that the drag coefficient is no longer independent of mach number, and tends to zero more slowly than the square of the thickness of the body. the large pressure change behind a discontinuity is made up remarkably rapidly. the first approximation to the lift coefficient is unchanged.
