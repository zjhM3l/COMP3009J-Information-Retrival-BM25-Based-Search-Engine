methods for estimating lift interference of wing-body combinations at supersonic speeds. the modified slender-body method used by nielsen, katzen, and tang in rm a50f06, 1950, to predict the lift and moment interference of triangular wing-body combinations has been adapted to combinations with other than triangular wings. that part of the method for predicting the effect of the body on the wing has been retained, but a new method for predicting the effect of the wing on the body has been presented. these methods have been applied to the prediction of the lift-curve slopes of nearly 100 triangular, rectangular, and trapezoidal wing-body configurations. the estimated and experimental values for the lift-curve slopes agree for most of the cases within 10 percent. some of the higher-order effects that must be taken into account in a theory that is to give greater accuracy than the present one are discussed. a numerical example illustrating the method is included.
