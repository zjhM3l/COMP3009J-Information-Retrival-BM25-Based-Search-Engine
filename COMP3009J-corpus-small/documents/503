theoretical prediction of the transonic characteristics of airfoils. it is shown that the author's transonic-flow airfoil theory can be used to estimate transonic drag-rise and onset-of- separation-effects mach numbers without reference to experimental results. a simple comparative method is applied to a series of airfoils, and the results are analyzed to determine some of the design features of importance in transonic flow. an improvement to this scheme is shown to give results in good agreement with experiment for both the first appearance of shock waves and the onset of separation effects. application to finite swept wings is briefly considered and illustrated.
