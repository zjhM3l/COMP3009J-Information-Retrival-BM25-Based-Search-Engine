inviscid leading-edge effect in hypersonic flow. current interest in the problem of inviscid-viscous interaction has led to the realization of the significant effect of the leading-edge thickness in hypersonic flow. the purpose of this note is to give an account of the downstream influence of the blunt leading edge on the basis of the hypersonic small perturbation theory.
