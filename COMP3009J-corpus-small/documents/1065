a free-flight investigation of ablation of a blunt body to a mach number of 13.1. a five-stage rocket-propelled research-vehicle system was flown to a maximum mach number of 13.1 at an altitude of approximately 78,000 feet to determine ablation characteristics of teflon in free flight. continuous in-flight measurements were made using sensors developed by the national aeronautics and space administration. the sensors were located on the blunted face of a nose cone constructed from teflon, with one at the stagnation point and two others at a surface distance of 0.62 radius on opposite sides of the stagnation point. the ablated-length measurements were in close agreement with analytical predictions. the analytical predictions, upon inclusion of the pertinent material property values, should be applicable to other materials as well as teflon.
