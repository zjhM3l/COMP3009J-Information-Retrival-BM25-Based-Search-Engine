survey of inviscid hypersonic flow theory for geometrically slender shapes. a survey is made of existing theories for the calculation of pressure distributions on slender bodies at hypersonic speeds. no account is taken of boundary layer displacement effects which are expected to become important above a mach number of about 10 for a slender body. first the breakdown of linearised supersonic theory is demonstrated as mach number increases above about 5, and this is followed by a derivation of the hypersonic similarity rule. this section includes a description of the piston-analogy. next a physical interpretation of hypersonic flow is outlined and a simple derivation of the modified newtonian pressure formula is given. the equations of flow through an oblique shock wave are simplified by assuming a strong shock, and various results are thereby derived. these include the tangent-wedge and tangent-cone formulae. this is followed by a description of the newtonian approximation for slender bodies, including the effect of centrifugal forces, and the connection with newtonian flow theory is emphasized for. the shock-expansion method is described in some detail for both two-and three-dimensional bodies, and finally some remarks are made about the available data sheets and tables for estimating pressures on cones and ogive-cylinders in yaw. the note does not claim to be original, even in presentation. the aim has been to prepare a reasonably complete survey of available theory for hypersonic flow over slender bodies, excluding viscous and explicit real gas effects. this will provide the background for further work in which experimental data will be analysed and in conjunction with which it is hoped to produce accurate design methods for estimating pressures and forces on shapes intended for sustained flight at hypersonic speeds.
