laminar heat transfer over blunt-nosed bodies at hypersonic flight speeds. this paper deals with two limiting cases of laminar heat transfer over blunt-nosed bodies at hypersonic flight speeds, or high stagnation temperatures.. (a) thermodynamic equilibrium, in which the chemical reaction rates are regarded as /very fast/ compared to the rates of diffusion across streamlines., (b) diffusion as rate-governing, in which the volume recombination rates within the boundary layer are /very slow/ compared to diffusion across streamlines. in either case the gas density near the surface of a blunt-nosed body is much higher than the density just outside the boundary layer, and the velocity and stagnation enthalpy profiles are much less sensitive to pressure gradient than in the more familiar case of moderate temperature differences. in fact, in case (a), the nondimensionalized enthalpy gradient at the surface is represented very accurately by the /classical/ zero pressure gradient value, and the surface heat-transfer rate distribution is obtained directly in terms of the surface pressure distribution. in order to illustrate the method, this solution is applied to the special cases of an unyawed hemisphere and an unyawed, blunt cone capped by a spherical segment. in the opposite limiting case where diffusion is rate-controlling the diffusion equation for each species is reduced to the same form as the low-speed energy equation, except that the prandtl number is replaced by the schmidt number. the simplifications introduced in case (a) are also applicable here, and the expression for surface heat transfer rate is similar., the maximum value of the ratio between the rate of heat transfer by diffusion alone and by heat conduction alone in the case of thermodynamic equilibrium is given by.. (prandtl no./schmidt no.) when the diffusion coefficient is estimated by taking a reasonable value of atom-molecule collision cross section this ratio is 1.30. additional theoretical and (especially) experimental studies are clearly required before these simple results are accepted.
