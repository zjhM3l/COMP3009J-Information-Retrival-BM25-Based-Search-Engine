laminar mixing of a non-uniform stream with a fluid at rest. a theoretical analysis is made of the constant pressure laminar mixing process between a stream having an initial boundary layer velocity profile, and a fluid at rest. the present theory follows the methods of w. tollmien and s. i. pai with certain modifications. the results apply to incompressible flow, but can be extended to the compressible case without difficulty.
