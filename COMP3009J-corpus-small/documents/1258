heat transfer, recovery factor and pressure distributions around a circular cylinder normal to a supersonic rarefied air stream. measurements of the heat transfer, recovery factor, and pressure distributions around a circular cylinder normal to a supersonic rarefied-air stream (total temperature 300 k.) are described for the mach number range of 1.3 to 5.7, the reynolds number range of 37 to 4,100 and at cylinder wall average temperature levels of 90 k. and 210 k. study of the results yielded.. (1) a correlation equation for the stagnation-point nusselt number as a function of the reynolds number just after the normal part of the detached bow shock wave,. and (2) fourier series expressions for the heat-transfer coefficient and pressure coefficient distributions in terms of the stagnation point values. in comparing these measurements with predictions based on recent analytical studies, exceptionally good agreement for the heat-transfer coefficient distribution was obtained with lees' theory. in the mach number range of 3.55 to 5.73 the pressure decreased less rapidly with distance from the stagnation point than predicted by the modified newtonian theory.
