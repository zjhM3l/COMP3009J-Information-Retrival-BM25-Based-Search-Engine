transition form laminar to turbulent shear flow. recent experimental studies of transition from laminar to turbulent shear flows are reviewed. certain common features are emphasized and related to the stability theories of viscous shear layers. the three-dimensional character, the unsteadiness, and the nonlinear and random behavior of the latter stages of the transition process are also examined.
