supersonic flow around blunt bodies. the newtonian theory of impact has been shown to be useful for pressure calculations on the forward facing part of bodies moving at high speed. it is now a familiar practice to use this information to calculate nonviscous velocities at the wall and then to estimate rates of heat transfer. this procedure is perhaps open to question,. heat-transfer rates depend on velocity gradients which are not given by the newtonian analysis. nor can one obtain information on boundary-layer stability or all the body stability derivatives. it seems, therefore, inevitable that, as design proceeds with these hypersonic missiles, there will be a greater need for more accurate aerodynamic theories either to predict what will happen in unfamiliar flight conditions or to effect an extrapolation from a known test result to the design condition.
