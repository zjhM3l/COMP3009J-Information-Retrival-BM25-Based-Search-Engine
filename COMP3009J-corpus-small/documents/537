stagnation point viscous hypersonic flow. several methods have been developed for computing the hypersonic, low reynolds number flow in the stagnation region of a blunt body. in general, these methods involve complicated numerical solutions. simultaneous iterations on several parameters are usually required in view of the boundary-value nature of the problem. the purpose of this note is to present an approximate closed-form solution to axisymmetric stagnation point hypersonic flow in the viscous layer regime.
