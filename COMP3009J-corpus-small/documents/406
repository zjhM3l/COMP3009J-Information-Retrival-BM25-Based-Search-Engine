on the behaviour of boundary layers at supersonic speeds. this paper considers the implications of recent advances in knowledge of the behaviour of boundary layers in supersonic flow. only the simplest case is considered-dashthat of the two-dimensional boundary layer on a flat plate, with nominal zero longitudinal pressure and temperature gradients. it is shown that the empirical/intermediate enthalpy/used with success in approximations for skin friction, etc., of laminar boundary layers is closely the same as the mean enthalpy with respect to velocity. furthermore, the mean enthalpics of laminar and turbulent boundary layers may be the same. a nonrigorous approach is made to the problems of self-induced pressure gradients, and the indications are that their effects on laminar skin friction, etc., may become noticeable at mach numbers greater than 5 and they increase as the surface temperature builds up towards zero heat-transfer conditions. the effects with turbulent boundary layers may not be so severe. finally, the results are applied to give an idea of the magnitude of the drag and aerodynamic heating problems up to m 10, and one result is that, if there is any conflict at the higher mach numbers between surface conditions required for high radiative emissivity and those which may be thought necessary for preserving a laminar boundary layer, then it may be better to choose the former.
