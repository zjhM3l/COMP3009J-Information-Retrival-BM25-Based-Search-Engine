interaction of secondary injectants and rocket exhaust for thrust vector control. tests were conducted with 1300- to 1500-lb thrust solid rocket motors in order to investigate the side-force generation mechanisms associated with the injection of a secondary fluid into the expansion cone of a solid propellant rocket nozzle for thrust-vector control. the nozzles were 15 conicals with a nominal expansion ratio of. all firings were conducted in zero-flow ejectors. freon-12, water, and gascous nitrogen were used as the injectant. nozzle-wall pressure profiles, side thrust, and the nozzle-wall shock interface were recorded. the general character of the pressure disturbance was defined. the major portion of the side force was generated by the pressure disturbance downstream of the injector. the axial-thrust augmentation generated by the injectant was calculated. the effects of nozzle-expansion ratio and injector location on the side force were clearly illustrated.
