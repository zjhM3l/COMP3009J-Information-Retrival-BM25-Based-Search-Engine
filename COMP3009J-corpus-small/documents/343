transpiration cooling experiments in a turbulent boundary layer at m=3. turbulent recovery factor and heat-transfer measurements have been made on a porous flat wall section at a nominal mach number of 3.0 and a reynolds number of approximately 4 x 10 using both air and helium as the transpired gas. measured heat-transfer coefficients correlate well with the compressible theory of rubesin for air and qualitatively with simple film theory for either coolant, indicating that the heat transfer from a turbulent boundary layer can be reduced by transpiration cooling to well below that of the uncooled boundary layer at the same reynolds number.
