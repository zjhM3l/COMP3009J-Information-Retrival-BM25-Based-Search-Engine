the smallest height of roughness capable of affecting boundary-layer transition. an investigation was made to determine the smallest size of isolated roughness that will affect transition in a laminar-boundary layer. critical heights for three types of roughness were found in a low-speed wind tunnel. the types were /1/ two-dimensional spanwise wires, /2/ three-dimensional discs, and /3/ a sandpaper type. in addition to type of roughness, test variables included the location of roughness, pressure distribution, degree of tunnel turbulence, and length of natural laminar flow. the most satisfactory correlation parameter was found to be the roughness reynolds number, based on the height of roughness and flow properties at this height. the value of this critical reynolds number was found to be substantially independent of all test variables except the shape of roughness. this parameter also correlates well other published data on critical roughness in low-speed flow. the value of the roughness reynolds number necessary to move transition forward to the roughness itself was also determined for the three types of roughness and was found to be approximately constant for a given type of roughness. an investigation of the limited amount of available data on critical roughness in supersonic flow indicates that the effects of roughness may still be correlated by the roughness reynolds number. the value of this reynolds number depends primarily on the mach number at the top of the roughness. when this mach number is greater than 1.0, the roughness reynolds number based on conditions behind a shock is probably the characteristic parameter.
