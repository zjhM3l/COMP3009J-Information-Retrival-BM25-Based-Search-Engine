viscous hypersonic similitude. an extension of classical hypersonic similitude is developed which takes into account the interaction effect of the displacement thickness of the boundary layer. a basic result of this viscous similitude is that the total drag including frictional drag obeys the classical similarity law for the pressure drag. additional similarity conditions governing viscous effects must be imposed in this similitude. underlying the similitude is a new hypersonic boundary-layer independence principle. according to this principle, the principal part of a hypersonic boundary layer with given pressure and wall temperature distributions and free-stream total enthalpy is independent of the (high) external mach number distribution outside the boundary layer. various features of viscous hypersonic similitudes are discussed. it is found, for example, that it applies to three- dimensional boundary-layer interaction effects on flat bodies, provided the concepts of strip theory may be applied, and provided the aspect ratio is an invariant.
