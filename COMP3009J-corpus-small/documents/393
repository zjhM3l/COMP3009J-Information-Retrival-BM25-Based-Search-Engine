the shear flow along a flat plate with uniform suction. recently, several authors have investigated the boundary layer in a shear flow. in this note, an exact solution of the navier-stokes equations will be presented, which represents the boundary layer along an infinite flat plate with uniform suction situated in a shear flow.
