some simple solutions to the problem of predicting boundary layer self-induced pressures. simplified theoretical approaches are shown, based on hypersonic similarity boundary-layer theory, which allow reasonably accurate estimates to be made of the surface pressures on plates on which viscous effects are important. the consideration of viscous effects includes the cases where curved surfaces, stream pressure gradients, and leading-edge bluntness are important factors.
