the lower bound of attainable sonic-boom over-pressure and design methods of approaching this limit. from a study of existing sonic-boom theory it has been possible to establish an approximate lower bound of attainable sonic-boom overpressure, which depends only on the airplane length, weight, and volume and on the flight conditions. this lower bound may be approached over a narrow range of flight conditions through the application of appropriate design considerations. in general, for intermediate values of lift coefficient the major portion of the lift generating surfaces must be located aft of the maximum cross-sectional area, whereas for higher values of lift coefficient the maximum area must be well forward and or the lift-producing surfaces must extend well toward the airplane nose.
