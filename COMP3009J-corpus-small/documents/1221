steady flow of conducting fluids in channels under transverse magnetic fields, with consideration of hall effect. an approximate method of solution based on a minimum principle is presented for the steady laminar incompressible flow of an electrically conducting fluid through a straight channel of arbitrary cross section with conducting or nonconducting walls in the presence of a uniform transverse magnetic field. the hall effect is taken into account by making simplifying assumptions that the gas is fully ionized and that both reynolds number and magnetic reynolds number are small. numerical calculations are carried out for the case of a rectangular channel.
