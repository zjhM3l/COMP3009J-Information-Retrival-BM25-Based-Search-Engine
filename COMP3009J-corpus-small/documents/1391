shock wave and flow field development in hypersonic re-entry. a study is made of when and how a shock wave and continuum-type flow field develop in the nose region of a highly cooled blunt body re- entering the atmosphere at hypersonic speed and in a free molecular flow regime. the various types of flow regimes encountered down to low altitude conditions are delineated, and the nature of the flow field and behavior of some of the aerodynamic characteristics are discussed. it is shown that for a highly cooled body, free molecule flow conditions occur at a higher altitude than previously indicated. based on available evidence, it is suggested that kinetic theory solutions, which are essentially modified free molecule results, along with the navier-stokes equations with no surface slip, serve to define all of the flow regimes except for a narrow transitional layer regime which has a height of less than one factor of 10 in free stream density change. it is also suggested that the appearance of a definable shock wave occurs very rapidly in terms of density change near the beginning of the transitional layer regime, and that its location, as in continuum flow, is governed principally by the body geometry, whereas its thickness is determined by a local mean free path.
