transformation between compressible and incompressible boundary layer equations. it is proposed to show that the boundary-layer equation of compressible flow can be reduced to that of incompressible flow. such work was initiated by stewartson and by rott and crabtree. in the following some of the restrictions imposed by references 1 and 2 will be removed, and it will be shown that the transformation from compressible boundary layer to incompressible boundary layer can be applied to the laminar, as well as turbulent, case. a direct method will be used for this purpose.
