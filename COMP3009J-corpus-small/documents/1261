a method of calculating velocity distribution for turbulent boundary layers in adverse pressure distributions. a new method of calculating the behavior of turbulent boundary layers in adverse pressure distributions is developed which permits direct determination of the velocity profile rather than the gross integral parameters normally used to infer the general character of the boundary layer. the method offers the simplicity of algebraic equations coupled with the use of charts rather than the laborious simultaneous solution of coupled differential equations required by existing methods. the method also affords, for the first time, a means of determining the total boundary-layer thickness, thus allowing calculation of the absolute as well as the nondimensional velocity distribution. the velocity profile is considered to be composed of two regions--an inner region which is described by the law of the wall and an outer region which is described by a function depicting the deviation from that law. the deviation function involves two parameters which are uniquely dependent upon the skin-friction coefficient and a third parameter which, for practical purposes, can be considered a constant. since the entire velocity distribution was found to be almost uniquely dependent upon the local skin friction, serious doubt is cast upon the generally accepted /history concept/ which considers the outer region of the boundary layer to be dependent on integrated upstream conditions. agreement between experimental velocity distributions and those calculated by the method presented here is generally very good. the analysis and calculation procedures which are presented are applicable to two-dimensional, pseudo-two- dimensional, and axisymmetric conical flows.
