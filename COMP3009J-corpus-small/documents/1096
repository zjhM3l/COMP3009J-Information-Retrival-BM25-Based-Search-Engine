qualitative measurements of the effective heats of ablation of several materials in supersonic air jets at stagnation temperature up to 11,000 f. the effective heats of ablation of a number of materials were derived from tests in supersonic air jets at stagnation temperatures ranging from 2,000 f to 11,000 f. the materials included the plastics teflon, nylon, lucite, and polystyrene,. the inorganic salts ammonium chloride and sodium carbonate, several phenolic resins of varied resin content and type of reinforcement,. and a melamine-fiber glass laminate.
