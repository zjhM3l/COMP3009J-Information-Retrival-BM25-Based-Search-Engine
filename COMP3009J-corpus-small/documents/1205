effects of cooling on boundary layer transition on a hemi- sphere in simulated hypersonic flow. an experimental investigation of the effects of cooling on boundary-layer transition on a 9-in. diameter hemisphere in simulated hypersonic flow is reported. the newtonian pressure distribution was obtained by use of a shroud and boundary layer cooling was achieved by internally cooling the model. transition was detected with hot wires and with a pitot tube at the surface. attained. transition was observed in the subsonic and near-sonic flow region at and upstream of n = 45. in this region the stagnation reynolds number at which transition occurred when the surface was highly polished was only slightly affected by cooling within the temperature range. thus, transition reversal does not occur on a polished spherical surface within the range of these tests, and we therefore conclude that the cooling did not cause the linear stability of boundary layer to decrease significantly. an essential feature of transition studies with boundary-layer cooling is the close control of surface roughness. in the present experiments this control required, in addition to a highly polished surface, the necessity for low water vapor dewpoint, the avoidance of carbon dioxide condensation and the utilzation of every available means for removing the dust from the airstream.
