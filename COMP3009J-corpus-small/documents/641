reduction of the clamped plate to two membrane problems with an application to uniformly loaded sectors. the clamped plate problem in the classical theory for the small deflection bending of flat plates is reduced to the solution by variational methods of two successive membrane problems. the first requires the least square minimisation of the average curvature of the deflected surface while the second problem concerns the integral of the gaussian curvature. there is a similar reduction for extensional problems where the boundary tractions are specified. the method is demonstrated by giving three distinct solutions to the problem of the clamped sector under a uniformly distributed load. one solution is of special interest because it is derived from a single membrane problem. numerical data are given.
