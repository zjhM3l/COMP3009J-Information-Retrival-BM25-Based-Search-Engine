local heat transfer and recovery temperature on a yawed cylinder at a mach number of 4. 15 and high reynolds numbers. local heat transfer, equilibrium temperatures, and wall static pressures have been measured on a circular cylinder at yaw angles of 0, 10, 20, 40, and 60. the reynolds number range of the tests was from 1x10 to 4x10 based on cylinder diameter. increasing the yaw angle from 0 to 40 increased the stagnation-line heat-transfer coefficients by 100 to 180 percent. a further increase in yaw angle to heat-transfer coefficients. at zero yaw angle the boundary layer over the entire front half of the cylinder was laminar but at yaw angles of 40 and 60 it was evidently completely turbulent, including the stagnation line, as determined by comparison of local heat-transfer coefficients with theoretical predictions. the level of heating rates and the nature of the chordwise distribution of heat transfer indicated that a flow mechanism different from the conventional transitional boundary layer may have existed at the intermediate yaw angles of 10 and 20. at all yaw angles the peak heat-transfer coefficient occurred at the stagnation line and the chordwise distribution of heat-transfer coefficient decreased monotonically from this peak. the average heat-transfer coefficients over the front half of the cylinder are in agreement with previous data for a comparable reynolds number range. the theoretical heat-transfer distributions for both laminar and turbulent boundary layers are calculated directly from simple quadrature formulas derived in the present report.
