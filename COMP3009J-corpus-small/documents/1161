stagnation point heat transfer measurements in dissociated air. the results of an experimental investigation of the laminar heat transfer at the stagnation point of a blunt body in partially dissociated air are presented and are compared to the theoretical treatment of fay and riddell. heat-transfer results are presented for air temperatures as high as 8,000 k. where more than periments were performed in a shock tube and the new experimental techniques and principles are discussed briefly. simulation of flight stagnation conditions at velocities up to satellite velocity of 26,000 ft. sec. is shown to be possible in shock tubes and data has been obtained over a large altitude range at these velocities.
