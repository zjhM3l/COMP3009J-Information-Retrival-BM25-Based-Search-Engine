free-flight measurements of the static and dynamic. this report presents equations, tables, and figures for use in the analysis of helium flow at supersonic and hypersonic speeds. the contents of the report and presentation of the data parallel that of a similar reference work (naca rep. 1135) prepared for air flow. the perfect-gas relations for continuous one-dimensional flow, normal- and oblique-shock waves, and prandtl-meyer expansions are the same as for air but are presented here for completeness. the tables present the values of useful dimensionless ratios for continuous one-dimensional flow and for normal-shock waves as functions of mach number. the helium viscosity relation as a function of temperature, mass-flow rates as a function of mach number and temperature, and the reynolds number as a function of mach number and stagnation temperature are plotted. the oblique-shock characteristics of wedges and cones in helium at mach numbers of 12, 16, 20, and 24 are presented in a series of plots. throughout all the computations, helium is considered to be a perfect gas.
