on fully developed channel flows,. some solutions and limitations, and effects of compressibility, variable properties, and body forces. an examination of the effects of compressibility, variable properties, and body forces on fully developed laminar flows has indicated several limitations on such streams. in the absence of a pressure gradient, but presence of a body force liquid this follows also for the case of a constant streamwise pressure gradient. these motions are exact in the sense of a couette flow. in the liquid case two solutions /not a new result/ can occur for the same boundary conditions. an approximate analytic solution was found which agrees closely with machine calculations. in the case of approximately exact flows, it turns out that for large temperature variations across the channel the effects of convection /due to, say, a wall temperature gradient/ and frictional heating must be negligible. in such a case the energy and momentum equations are separated, and the solutions are readily obtained. if the temperature variations are small, then both convection effects and frictional heating can consistently be considered. this case becomes the constant-property incompressible case /or quasi-incompressible case for free-convection flows/ considered by many authors. finally, there is a brief discussion of cases wherein streamwise variations of all quantities are allowed but only in such form that the independent variables are separable. for the case where the streamwise velocity varies inversely as the square root of distance along the channel, a solution is given.
