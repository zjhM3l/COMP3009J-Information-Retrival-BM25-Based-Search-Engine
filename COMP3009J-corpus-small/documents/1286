equilibrium real-gas performance charts for a shypersonic shock-tube wind-tunnel employing nitrogen. charts are presented covering a wide range of reflected-shock wind-tunnel operating conditions, using nitrogen as the working gas. a statistical-mechanical model of the gas is assumed which takes account of molecular vibration, electronic excitation and dissociation. the gas is assumed to be constantly in equilibrium that is, the reaction rates are taken to be infinitely fast. the equations of motion are solved with the aid of a digital computer, previously reported results for the state of the shock-processed gas in the shock-tube being used.
