heat transfer to slender cones in hypersonic flow, including effects of yaw and nose bluntness. as part of a general study of the aerothermodynamic characteristics of flight of hypersonic vehicles, an investigation of laminar heat transfer to slender yawed cones has been conducted. experiments have been made in the cal 11- by 15-in. shock tunnel at mach numbers from 11 to 13 and at yaw angles up to were tested. the heat-transfer rates are compared with theoretical predictions. the effects on the local heat-transfer rates of the boundary-layer displacement thickness, transverse curvature, yaw, nose bluntness, and the entropy sublayer are discussed. it is shown that, at zero yaw, the experimental data for the sharp cone are in good agreement with theory when boundary-layer displacement and transverse-curvature effects are included. for the yawed sharp cone, the heat-transfer rates along the most windward streamline are in good agreement with reshotko's theory for yaw angles up to 3. at larger yaw angles, the experimental heat transfer was found to be greater than that predicted theoretically. however, at these yaw angles the heat-transfer distribution on the windward side was in good agreement with laminar-boundary-layer calculations based on an assumption of local similarity. the zero-yaw tests of the blunted cones showed qualitative agreement with cheng's shock-layer theory for slender blunt-nose bodies.
