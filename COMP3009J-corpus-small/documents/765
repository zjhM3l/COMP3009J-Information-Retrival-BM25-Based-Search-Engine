clamped short oval cylindrical shells under hydrostatic pressure. the principle of the minimum of the total potential is employed to obtain stresses and displacements for clamped, short, oval cylindrical shells under hydrostatic pressure. classical shell theory, in which buckling effects are not considered, was used. a fourier series is assumed for the deflections in the closed circumferential direction so that the partial differential equations of equilibrium are replaced by a set of ordinary differential equations. the energy solution is compared with a simplified approximation which can be considered an equivalent circular cylinder solution. graphs of the significant stresses and displacements are presented for oval cylinders having major to minor axis ratios of 1.10, 1.30, and 1.50. it is shown that the maximum stresses and displacements increase significantly as the major to minor axis ratio is increased.
