on the boundary layer equations in hypersonic flow and their approximate solutions. analytical solutions of the prandtl boundary-layer equations are obtained for the problem of the /strong/ interaction between the leading-edge shock and the viscous layer over a flat plate at hypersonic velocities. as the mach number increases and the interaction region spreads downstream over the plate, the local skin-friction coefficient increases rapidly over its conventional value. the local heat-transfer coefficient at first remains practically unaffected but then also begins to increase with mach number.
