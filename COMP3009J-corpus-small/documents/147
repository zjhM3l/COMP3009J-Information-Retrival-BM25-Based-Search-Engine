supersonic flow past slender pointed wings with ?similar? cross sections at zero lift. some recent theoretical work on slender pointed wings at zero lift is co-ordinated and extended. the wings considered may have any pointed plan form shape, provided that the trailing edge is straight and unswept. the root section profile and cross-section shapes are arbitrary, provided that, on any one wing, the latter are /descriptively similar/ (diamond or parabolic biconvex for instance), though not necessarily geometrically similar. the chief aim of the work is to find wings with simple geometry, low wave drag and pressure distributions which are unlikely to be seriously affected by viscous effects. wave drag and pressure distributions are calculated by slender-wing theory. general formulae, which are both simple and instructive, are given for the wave drag and the overall pressure distribution, with particular emphasis on the root pressure distribution. results for a number of wings of special interest are presented and discussed.
