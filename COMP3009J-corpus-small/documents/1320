divergence of plate airfoils of low aspect ratio at supersonic speeds. in part (1), as a first approach to a theoretical investigation of low aspect ratio rectangular plate wings of constant thickness, the two assumptions are made that.. (a) the spanwise form of the structural distortion is known, leaving the chordwise distortion arbitrary,. and (b) the aerodynamic forces are approximations of the supersonic linearized theory. the form of the chordwise distortion is then deduced from the differential equation representing the state of neutral equilibrium for small displacements at the critical divergence speed. secondly, this problem is investigated using measured structural flexibility coefficients together with theoretical aerodynamic coefficients. thirdly, the usual series solution based on the rayleigh-ritz approach is discussed, using the same assumptions as in the first method. all the results of these methods are consistent and indicate that the transonic regime at m = 1 is the most critical for divergence. in part (2), it is established that sweeping the leading edge of a plate airfoil of constant thickness increases its stability. for angles of sweep less than 30, the critical conditions occur when the leading edge is sonic, but for angles greater than 30 the critical conditions occur when m = 1.
