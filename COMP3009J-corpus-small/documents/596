the properties of crossed flexure pivots, and the influence of the point at which the strips cross. it is shown that the rotational stiffness of a crossed flexure pivot varies considerably when subjected to an applied force. the type of variation can be radically changed simply by moving the point at which the strips cross. the relation between torque and rotation for a given applied force is not exactly linear and the extent of the non-linearity is determined by taking into account the small movements of the centre of rotation of the pivot. finally, for design purposes, an analysis of the maximum stresses in the strips is given.
