interaction of a charged satellite with the ionosphere. the problem of the ion density distribution around a charged satellite has been treated by a numerical method which does not require linearization of the equations or restriction to infinitesimal objects. however, magnetic field effects were not considered, and a number of other simplifying assumptions were required. some sample calculations for spherical satellites are presented, illustrating the general character of the satellite wake. calculations of the so-called /charge drag/ were also made, yielding results qualitatively similar to those previously obtained by jastrow and pearse.
