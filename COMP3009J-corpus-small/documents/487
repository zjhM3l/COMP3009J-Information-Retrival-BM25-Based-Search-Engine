theory for supersonic two-dimensional, laminar, base-type flows using the crocco-lees mixing concepts. a separated flow field, in which the incoming boundary layer is undisturbed up to the separation point, is defined as a / base-type/ flow. examples are the flows over a blunt base and over a backward-facing step. the crocco-lees theory is applied to the supersonic, two-dimensional, laminar, base-type flows defined above. the separated flow is divided into a mixing region and a recompression (or reattachment) region. calculations of base pressure show its dependence on the mach number and on two reynolds-number-dependent variables, and. it is shown that existing base-pressure data can be explained by these results.
