tunnel tests on a double cascade to determine the interaction between the rotor and the nozzles of a supersonic turbine. experimental confirmation has been required that in a supersonic turbine the leading edges of the rotor governs the rotor incidence and, hence, the gas exit angle from the nozzles. evidence has also been required that, once the rotor incidence has been allowed for, there is no adverse effect of the rotors on the nozzle flow, even when the rotors have a large turning angle. the present test cascade represented the stationary configuration of a turbine of 2.5 nozzle mach number and 74 swirl angle, the rotors being designed to operate at 1.9 relative mach number and to provide a turning angle of 140. in the tests, fully supersonic flow could be established through the system, but the losses were fairly high and an increase in loss of about 25 per cent would have caused choking in the rotor.
