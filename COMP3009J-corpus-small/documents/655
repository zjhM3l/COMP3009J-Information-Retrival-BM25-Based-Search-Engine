effects of boundary layer displacement and leading edge bluntness on pressure distribution, skin friction, and heat transfer of bodies at hypersonic speeds. results are presented of an investigation to determine the effect of boundary-layer displacement and leading-edge bluntness on surfaces in hypersonic flow. the presence of the boundary layer and the blunt leading edge induce pressure gradients which in turn affect the skin friction and heat transfer to the surface. methods for predicting these phenomena on two-dimensional surfaces are given and a brief review of recent three-dimensional results is presented.
