on the plk method and the supersonic blunt-body problem. detailed analysis of the subsonic and transonic portious of the flow field about either very blunt or asymmetric configurations requires successive approximations,. these can be carried out in a systematic fashion only when an appropriate convergent perturbation procedure is available. the problem of producing successively refined sets of initial conditions for either /direct/ or /inverse/ analysis of the flow is formulated in the following terms.. given reasonable estimates for shock shape and pressure distribution on the body, can one determine the flow field of interest to any desired degree of approximation by a perturbation approach.qm a procedure to this effect is developed which involves stretching of coordinates in the spirit of the poincare-lighthill-kuo are transformed along body, shock, and intermediate lines so as to annul perturbations of the local resultant velocity,. (b) for the integral method the coordinate along the boundary of each strip is shifted so as to control perturbations of the velocity component that determines the critical point. the approach is justified by a study of the equations governing the direct method, and by consideration of model transonic flow problems for which closed form solutions are available. the range of validity of the proposed procedure is assessed by practical application and comparison with experiment,. results are presented for a disk set normal to a low-termperature air stream at m = 4.76, and for a highly asymmetric two-dimensional configuration at m = 8.
