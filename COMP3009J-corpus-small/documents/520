wing-tail interference as a cause of 'magnus' effects on a finned missile. wing-tail interference is shown to cause large /magnus/ effects on a finned missile whose wings are deflected into an aileron setting. a simple experimental method with water as the working medium is used to obtain low-speed magnus data on a rolling missile. the missile is a slender cruciform configuration with all-movable wings and fixed tail fins. magnus data are presented for angles of attack up to 15 and for the one (high) roll rate which accompanies a 30 aileron deflection angle of the wings. tests conducted at zero roll rate but with the wing deflection maintained, revealed large forces in the magnus direction, thereby providing the basis for understanding magnus effects due to wing-tail interference. a semiempirical theory is proposed to explain the experimental data. a simplified model of the wake behind the wings is introduced to predict tail-interference factors. good agreement with the data is obtained. this magnus effect is opposite in direction to the classical magnus lift on a spinning cylinder ,. it is much larger than either that effect or the one on a missile with only one set of fins. wing-tail interference is the predominant source of the effect ,. roll rate only modifies the basic interference mechanism.
