effects of surface tension and viscosity on taylor instability. the model used is that of two fluids of infinite depth, with the interface initially in the form of a sine wave with amplitude small compared to wave length. the fluids are considered incompressible, and only the linear terms in the equations of hydrodynamics are used. the first four sections discuss the effects of surface tension and viscosity. the fifth gives a few numerical results to illustrate the main points of the preceding sections.
