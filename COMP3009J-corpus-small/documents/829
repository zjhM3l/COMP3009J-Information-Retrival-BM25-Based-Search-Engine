stability of thin-walled tubes under torsion. in this paper a theoretical solution is developed for the torsion on a round thin-walled tube for which the walls become unstable. the results of this theory are given by a few simple formulas and curves which cover all cases. the differential equations of equilibrium are derived in a simpler form than previously found, it being shown that many items can be neglected. the solution obtained is length ratio is zero and infinite, and is a good approximation for intermediate cases. the theory is compared with all available experiments, including about 50 tests made by the author. the experimental-failure torque is always smaller than the theoretical-buckling torque, averaging about 75 percent of it, with a minimum of 60 percent. as the form of the deflection checks closely with that predicted by theory and the experiments cover a great range of shapes and materials, this discrepancy can reasonably be ascribed largely to initial eccentricities in actual tubes.
