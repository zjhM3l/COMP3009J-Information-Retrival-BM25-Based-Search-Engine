experimental investigation of the effect of yaw on rates of heat transfer to transverse circular cylinders in a 6500-foot-per-second hypersonic air stream. a technique has been developed by which air can be shock-compressed by helium to 3660 degrees rankine to generate a 6500-foot-per-second air stream with a flow duration of 40 milliseconds. the resulting equipment is described. experiments were conducted to determine rates of heat transfer to transverse circular cylinders of 0.003-, greater than 100. the cylinders were tested at a nominal mach number of 11 with a stagnation reynolds number (evaluated with free-stream mass flow and stagnation viscosity of 4.00 times 10 to the 4th power per foot.
