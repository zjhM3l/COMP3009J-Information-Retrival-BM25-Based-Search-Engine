turbulent diffusion in the wake of a blunt nosed body at hypersonic speeds. at reynolds numbers greater than about 5 x 10 corresponding to altitudes below about 180,000 ft, the hot outer inviscid wake behind the bow shock wave produced by a blunt-nosed body at hypersonic speeds is cooled mainly by turbulent diffusion and conduction. turbulence originates in the inner wake formed by the coalescence of the free shear layers (or annulus) shed from the body surface when the boundary layer separates from the surface. as this turbulence spreads outward, it swallows enthalpy or momentum defect originally contained in the outer inviscid wake. if the turbulence is locally similar--i.e., if it behaves at each station like a slice of a low-speed /self-similar/ wake--then the turbulent diffusivity grows from a low initial value near the body to a value corresponding to the total drag of the body at about 300 body diameters downstream. at flight velocities of the order of 9,000-10,000 ft per sec. the growth of the turbulent inner wake predicted on the basis of locally similar turbulence is in good agreement with shadowgraph measurements of wake widths behind spheres obtained in ballistic ranges in the region from 200 to 4,000 body diameters downstream of the body. tentatively, one concludes that the turbulence mechanism in the wake with respect to a fixed observer is similar to the low-speed case, in spite of the large mean temperature gradients. in order to illustrate the behavior of an observable such as electron density in a turbulent wake behind a blunt body, the two limiting cases of thermodynamic equilibrium and pure diffusion (zero electron-ion recombination rate) are calculated for m = 22 at altitudes of 100,000 and 200,000 ft. even for the case of thermodynamic equilibrium, the predicted turbulent radar trail length is about 200 body diameters at l-band (1,300 mc) at 100,000-ft altitude and about 150 body diameters for uhf (400 mc) at 200,000 ft. one interesting result is that the width of the plasma cylinder corresponding to the plasma requency at l-band remains virtually constant at about 3.5 body diameters in the range 30 150 at 100,000-ft altitude. these results are sufficiently encouraging that one can consider including the effects of finite chemical and electron-ion recombination rates in the analysis in order to give a more complete picture of the wake at hypersonic speeds.
