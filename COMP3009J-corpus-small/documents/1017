note on creep buckling of columns. it appears from librove's interesting analysis that, for the case of creep buckling of columns, the initial imperfections contained in ordinary columns provide the mechanism by which failure due to creep occurs after a period of time. in fact, it can be concluded from this analysis that a theoretically perfect column that is initially loaded below the time-independent critical load will not buckle at all. this is an interesting contrast to the case of static buckling where small initial imperfections play an insignificant role, since the failing load of an initially imperfect column is substantially the same as that of a theoretically perfect column. it is of interest, therefore, to conjecture whether there is any possible mechanism by which a column containing no initial imperfections can fail as a result of creep when the initial load is less than the theoretical buckling load.
