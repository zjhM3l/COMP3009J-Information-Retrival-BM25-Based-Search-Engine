the buckling of thin cylindrical shells under axial compression. in two previous papers the authors have discussed in detail the inadequacy of the classical theory of thin shells in explaining the buckling phenomenon of cylindrical and spherical shells. it was shown that not only the calculated buckling load is 3 to 5 times higher than that found by experiments, but the observed wave pattern of the buckled shell is also different from that predicted. furthermore, it was pointed out that the different explanations for this discrepancy advanced by l. h. donnell and w. flugge are untenable when certain conclusions drawn from these explanations are compared with the experimental facts. by a theoretical investigation on spherical shells the authors were led to the belief that in general the buckling phenomenon of curved shells can only be explained by means of a non-linear large deflection theory. this point of view was substantiated by model experiments on slender columns with non-linear elastic support. the non-linear characteristics of such structures cause the load necessary to keep the shell in equilibrium to drop very rapidly with increase in wave amplitude once the structure started to buckle. thus, first of all, a part of the elastic energy stored in the shell is released once the buckling has started,. this explains the observed rapidity of the buckling process. furthermore, as it was shown in one of the previous papers the buckling load itself can be materially reduced by slight imperfections in the test specimen and vibrations during the testing process. in this paper, the same ideas are applied to the case of a thin uniform cylindrical shell under axial compression. first it is shown by an approximate calculation that again the load sustained by the shell drops with increasing deflection. then the results of this calculation are used for a more detailed discussion of the buckling process as observed in an actual testing machine.
