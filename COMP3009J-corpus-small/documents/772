an experimental study of jet-flap compressor blades. the results of a preliminary experimental investigation to determine the feasibility of using the jet flap to improve the section characteristics of an axial-flow compressor blade are presented and discussed trailing edge. internal design of the blade is described and details of the resulting jet flow are given. also included are wind-tunnel design and test procedures for the two-dimensional cascade used in the test. test results are presented in the form of the measured turning angle, pressure rise, and lift coefficient. they are examined with particular reference to the prevention of rotating stall.
