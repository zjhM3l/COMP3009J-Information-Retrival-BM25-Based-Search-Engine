on slip-flow heat transfer to a flat plate. assuming that continuum flow energy equation in a boundary layer remains valid well into slip region and taking account of the temperature jump in a moving rarefied gas and for influence of large mean free path through appropriate boundary conditions, a solution is found for the temperature gradient in the slip region. then from maslen expression (j. aero. sci. 25, 6, 400-401, june slipping fluid to a flat plate, and behavior confirms results for small values of knudsen number.
