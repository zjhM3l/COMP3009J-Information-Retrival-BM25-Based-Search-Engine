supersonic boom of wing-body configurations. the supersonic boom in steady, level flight of a wing-body configuration is due to the effects of body volume, wing volume, wing incidence or lift, and wing-body interference. the contribution in the far field of each of these factors can, in any given azimuthal plane, be represented as that of an equivalent body of revolution. this concept is developed to investigate the possibilities of using interference among the components of a wing-body configuration to reduce or suppress the boom due to lift. results of wind tunnel experiments are also presented and discussed in light of the theoretical indications.
