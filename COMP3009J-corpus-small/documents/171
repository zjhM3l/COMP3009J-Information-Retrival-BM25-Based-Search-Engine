a low density wind tunnel study of shock wave structure and relaxation phenomena in gases. the profiles and thicknesses of normal shock waves of moderate strength have been determined experimentally in terms of the variation of the equilibrium temperature of an insulated transverse cylinder in free-molecule flow. the shock waves were produced in a steady state in the jet of a low-density wind tunnel, at initial mach numbers of 1.72 and 1.82 in helium and 1.78, the shock thickness, determined from the maximum slope of the cylinder temperature profile, varied from mean free path in the supersonic stream. a comparison between the experimental shock profiles and various theoretical predictions leads to the tentative conclusions that.. (1) the navier-stokes equations are adequate for the description of the shock transition for initial mach numbers up to 2, and (2) the effects of rotational relaxation times in air can be accounted for by the introduction of a /second/ or /bulk/ viscosity coefficient equal to about two-thirds of the ordinary shear viscosity.
