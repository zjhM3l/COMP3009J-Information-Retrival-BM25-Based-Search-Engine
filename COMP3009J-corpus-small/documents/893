a new design of pitot-static tube with a discussion of pitot-static tubes and their calibration factors. the report describes experiments devised to investigate some of the previously unexplained peculiarities of normal types of pitot-static tube. in the process use was made of what was as nearly as could be a standard static pressure tube. the experiments led to a new alternative design of instrument having a nose of modified ellipsoidal shape and for which the main characteristics have been investigated. it has been found to be necessary as well as desirable to include a discussion of the implications of the term /calibration factor/ and (although not in this respect comprehensive) of the special features and limitations of various pitot-static tubes.
