hypersonic shock layer theory of the stagnation region at low reynolds number. cheng, h.k. hypersonic flow at low reynolds number is studied utilizing the shock-layer concept. the present formulation takes into account the salient features of the transport processes within the shock layer in a manner consistent with the shock-layer approximation. the rankine-hugoniot shock relations are modified to include contributions due to heat conduction and viscous effects immediately behind the shock. the specific problem of an axisymmetric stagnation region is treated. the flow regimes for this problem can be classified according to whether or not the transport effects are important immediately behind the shock. in one regime where the ordinary rankine-hugoniot relations hold across the shock, the vorticity-interaction theory based on the boundary-layer approximation is shown to be sufficient. in the other regime where the rankine-hugoniot relations have to be modified but the continuum-flow model applies, an approximate, an analytical solution is obtained. this solution reveals a substantial reduction of the temperature behind the shock and of the shock stand-off distance in the presence of strong surface cooling. the present study is intended to provide a knowledge to bridge the gap between the free-molecule flow regime and that of the boundary layer via the continuum theory. in this respect, the solution obtained appears to be satisfactory in that it yields the correct free-molecule limits for the skin friction and surface-heat transfer rate.
