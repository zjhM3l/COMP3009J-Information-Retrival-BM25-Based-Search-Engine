thin airfoil theory based on approximate solution of the transonic flow equation. the present paper describes a method for the approximate solution of the nonlinear equations of transonic small disturbance theory. although the solutions are nonlinear, the analysis is sufficiently simple that results are obtained in closed analytic form for a large and significant class of nonlifting airfoils. application to two-dimensional flows with free-stream mach number near 1 leads, for instance, to general expressions for the determination of the pressure distribution on an airfoil of specified geometry and for the shape of an airfoil having a prescribed pressure distribution and gives, furthermore, the correct variation of pressure with mach number at mach number 1. for flows that are subsonic everywhere, the method yields a pressure-correction formula that is more accurate than the prandtl-glauert rule and compares favorably with existing higher approximations. for flows that are supersonic everywhere, the method yields the equivalent, in transonic approximation, of simple wave theory. results obtained by application of these general expressions are shown to correspond closely to existing solutions and to experimental data for a wide variety of airfoils.
