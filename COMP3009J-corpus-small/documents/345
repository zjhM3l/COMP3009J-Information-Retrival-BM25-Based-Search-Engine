the interaction of shock waves with boundary layer on a flat surface. the development of supersonic compressors, supersonic diffusers, and high-speed aircraft points to the increasing importance of the interaction between shock waves and boundary layers. the experimental work reported here is intended to (1) provide a better understanding of the nature of the shock boundary-layer interaction, (2) serve as a guide and stimulus to theoretical work, and (3) develop an empirical method for predicting the effects of the interaction. experiments were performed on the reflection of an oblique shock from a boundary layer on a flat surface at a mach number of 2.05. the effects of shock strength and boundary-layer regime were explored. the results are in the form of schlieren photographs, constant-density contours found from interferometer photographs, and static pressure distributions at the plate surface.
