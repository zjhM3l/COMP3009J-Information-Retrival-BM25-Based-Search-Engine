magnetohydrodynamics shocks. a mathematical treatment of the coupled motion of hydrodynamic flow and electromagnetic fields is given. two simplifying assumptions are introduced.. first, the conductivity of the medium is infinite, and second, the motion is described by a plane shock wave. various orientations of the plane of the shock and the magnetic field are discussed separately, and the extreme relativistic and unrelativistic behavior is examined. special consideration is given to the behavior of weak shocks, that is, of sound waves. it is interesting to note that the waves degenerate into common sound waves and into common electromagnetic waves in the extreme cases of very weak and very strong magnetic fields.
