an approximate solution of hypersonic laminar boundary layer equations and its application. approximate formulae of the displacement thickness and the skin friction of the hypersonic laminar boundary layer are derived by use of von karman's integral method, assuming the heat-insulated wall, the prandtl number of unity and chapman and rubesin's formula for the variation of viscosity with temperature. the results obtained are compared with some exact solutions. because of the good agreement, it seems that these formulae are very useful. these formulae, together with the tangent-wedge-approximation, are applied to the viscous flow over slender bodies with a sufficiently sharp leading edge. as an example, the pressure distribution over a flat plate is calculated numerically over the entire region of the surface. comparison with other author's theoretical results as well as experimental values is made.
