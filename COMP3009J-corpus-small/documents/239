design and calibration at low speeds of a static tube and a pitot-static tube with semi-ellipsoidal nose shapes. a new static tube and a new pitot-static tube have been designed and calibrated in the no.1 and the no.2 11 ft x 8 ft wind tunnels of the r.a.e., using a long static tube, the error of which is believed to be very small, as a standard for comparison. the results show that the static pressure measured by these tubes is in error due to the supporting strut and to the nose shape of the tube by an amount which may be calculated for positions of the static slot, or holes, greater than 10 tube diameters ahead of the strut. the readings show no measurable scale effect in the speed range 100-230 ft sec. the static tube is insensitive to yaw in the range 1 with a square-edged slot and is even less sensitive to yaw when the slot edges are rounded. the turbulence of the tunnel has an effect on the static pressure reading.
