axisymmetric magnetohydrodynamic channel flow. the axisymmetric subsonic and supersonic flow fields, and the skin friction and heat transfer of an electrically conducting compressible fluid flowing in a channel of constant circular area through a magnetic field are investigated when the magnetic reynolds number is small. the inviscid-flow field for flow through a dipole field is solved by the method of characteristics in the supersonic case. for the subsonic case, linearized equations are derived for small values of the magnetic interaction parameter. numerical results are obtained by the relaxation method. the inviscid-flow-field solutions are used as boundary conditions for the laminar boundary layer along the wall, in which axial pressure gradients form an important feature. the exact continuum-flow equations are reduced by an order-of-magnitude analysis to the boundary-layer equations, which are solved numerically by an integral method using a fourth-degree velocity profile and a fifth-degree stagnation-enthalpy profile. pressure, temperature, and heat-transfer measurements are made with a shock tube under supersonic-flow conditions closely approaching those used in the numerical computations. general agreement is found between the theoretical and the experimental results.
