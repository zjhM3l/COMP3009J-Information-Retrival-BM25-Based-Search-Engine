note on creep buckling of columns. the results of short-time creep-buckling and creep-bending tests of slenderness ratio 111 are presented. the tests were performed at 600 f, and strain measurements were taken with high-temperature electric-resistance strain gages. a description of the development of the gages is given in an appendix. the column tests show that the critical time decreases much more rapidly with increasing load than with increasing initial deviation from straightness. the bending tests indicate that the steady creep rate of the curvature is a simple power function of applied moment. these latter results, together with a previously derived creep-buckling theory, are used to develop a semiempirical formula suitable as a guide for the determination of the critical time for columns.
