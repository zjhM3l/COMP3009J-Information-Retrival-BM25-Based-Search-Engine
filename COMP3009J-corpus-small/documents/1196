growth of the turbulent wake behind a supersonic sphere. experimental data are presented on the growth of turbulent wakes up to 8000 calibers behind and spheres traveling at supersonic velocities. experimental determination of the exponential coefficient in the growth law is very difficult, if not impossible. data are presented in the form of both. in the representation, two regions of different wake growths are observed. by means of a quasi-steady state assumption, the effect of drag deceleration is eliminated and growth of the far wake compared with theoretical predictions. the agreement with the lees-hromas theory in this region was found to be quite good.
