sublimation in a hypersonic environment. a priori knowledge of the response of materials subjected to a severe aerothermal environment is essential in the space age. the successful design of space and re-entry vehicles demands that the fundamental problem of the interaction between a material and dissociated air be properly formulated and solved. in this paper, the problem of sublimation in a hypersonic environment is considered. in this study of hypersonic ablation, the pertinent conservation equations are derived and the simultaneous processes of diffusion, convection, and thermal exchange are analyzed for the vaporization of a refractory material which is subjected to the environmental conditions encountered during hypersonic reentry. for simplicity, only the forward stagnation point of an axially symmetric body is treated. it is shown that the quantity, called the effective heat of vaporization, which includes all heat absorbing or heat blocking effects, is an increasing function of flight speed, independent of body size, except where nonequilibrium vaporization effects or radiative effects appear.
