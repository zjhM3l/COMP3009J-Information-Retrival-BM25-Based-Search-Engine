approximate formulas for thermal-stress analysis. the basis of any thermal-stress analysis is the determination of the temperature distributions in the structure. for arbitrary flight histories, the determination of such distributions is rather tedious and not completely general. this latter fact handicaps optimization studies in the project design stage when it is desirable to be able to express the thermal-stress distributions in a general manner. in this note, general expressions are derived for the thermal-stress distributions in a typical i-section using similar assumptions to those of biot.
