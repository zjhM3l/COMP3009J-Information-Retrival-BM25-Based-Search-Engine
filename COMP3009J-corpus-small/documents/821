inelastic column theory. the action of a column in the plastic range is analyzed on the basis that bending may proceed simultaneously with increasing axial load. this leads to a new column formula that includes both the tangent-modulus (engesser) and the reduced-modulus the tangent-modulus load and that the column load increases with increasing lateral deflection, approaching the reduced-modulus load as a limit if the tangent modulus is assumed to remain constant.
