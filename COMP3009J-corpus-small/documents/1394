stagnation point heat transfer measurements in hypersonic low density flow. in hypersonic, low reynolds number flow around a blunt body, the boundary-layer thickness approaches the shock-layer thickness (shock standoff distance) within the region of continuum flow. in this instance, the customary boundary-layer approximations no longer apply. hoshizaki and probstein have obtained solutions to the incompressible navier-stokes equations in the stagnation region of a blunt body in this hypersonic low reynolds number flow. the results indicate that heat-transfer rates are substantially higher than those predicted by incompressible boundary-layer theory. probstein indicated that the actual heat-transfer rates would be correspondingly higher than the predictions of fay and riddell. these findings are of particular importance in the atmospheric entry phase of recoverable satellites.
