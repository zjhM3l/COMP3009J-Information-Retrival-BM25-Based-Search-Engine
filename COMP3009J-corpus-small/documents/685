aerodynamic effects of some configuration variables on the aeroelastic characteristics of lifting surfaces at mach numbers from 0. 7 to 6. 86. results of flutter tests on some simple all-movable-control-type models are given. one set of models, which had a square planform with double-wedge airfoils with four different values of leading- and trailing-edge radii from 0 to 6 percent chord and airfoil thicknesses of 9, 11, at mach numbers from 0.7 to 6.86. the bending-to-torsion frequency ratio was about 0.33. the other set of models, which had a tapered planform with single-wedge and double-wedge airfoils with thicknesses of 3, 6, 9, and 12 percent chord, was tested at mach numbers from 0.7 to 3.98 and a frequency ratio of about 0.42. the tests indicate that, in general, increasing thickness has a destabilizing effect at the higher mach numbers but is stabilizing at subsonic and transonic mach numbers. double-wedge airfoils are more prone to flutter than single-wedge airfoils at comparable stiffness levels. increasing airfoil bluntness has a stabilizing effect on the flutter boundary at supersonic speeds but has a negligible effect at subsonic speeds. however, increasing bluntness may also lead to divergence at supersonic speeds. results of calculations using second-order piston-theory aerodynamics in conjunction with a coupled-mode analysis and an uncoupled-mode analysis are compared with the experimental results for the sharp-edge airfoils at supersonic speeds. the uncoupled-mode analysis more accurately predicted the flutter characteristics of the tapered-planform models, whereas the coupled-mode analysis was somewhat better for the square-planform models. for both the uncoupled- and coupled-mode analyses, agreement with the experimental results improved with increasing mach number. in general, both methods of analysis gave unconservative results with respect to the experimental flutter boundaries.
