the surface oil flow technique as used in high speed wind tunnels in the united kingdom. an examination has been made of the various versions of the surface oil flow technique used in different high speed wind tunnels. to provide background information for this investigation some systematic tests were made on a simple model in a small supersonic tunnel. the experience gained made it possible to explain many of the variations in terms of the different operating conditions of the tunnels. the time taken to form a pattern on a typical model is, to a first approximation, directly proportional to the value of the parameter, the factor being 36,000 12,000. the time taken appears to be independent of the initial thickness of the oil sheet. a general procedure for the development of oil mixtures for any purpose is suggested.
