flutter analysis of circular panels. the flutter problem of flat circular panels with edges elastically restrained against rotation has been formulated in terms of small-deflection plate theory. the panel is subjected to uniform all-round tension or compression in its middle plane, in addition to the supersonic compressible flow passing over its upper surface with still air below. linear piston theory is employed to predict the aerodynamic load on the vibrating panel. the problem is investigated by a rayleigh-type analysis involving chosen modes of the panel as degrees of freedom. in order to investigate the convergence of the solution, the flutter-mode shape of the clamped-edge panel has been expressed in a series form in powers of r cos o. the results of three-, four-, and five-term approximations have displayed oscillatory behavior with apparently rapid convergence of the solution.
