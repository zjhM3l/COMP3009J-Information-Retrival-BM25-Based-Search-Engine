a proposed programme of wind tunnel tests at hypersonic speeds to investigate the lifting properties of geometrically slender shapes. a programme of tests at hypersonic speeds on slender bodies is described, which has the aim of investigating how lift is generated, and the compromises that may be enforced by aerodynamic heating. the programme is based on models of simple geometric shape, from which lifting configurations will later be built up.
