two dimensional transonic flow past airfoils. this report concerns the problem of constructing solutions for transonic flows over symmetric airfoils. the aspect of the problem emphasized is, of necessity, not how to form a solution for compressible flow but how to simplify the initial phase of the problem, namely, the mapping of the incompressible flow. in the case of the symmetric joukowski airfoil without circulation, the mapping is relatively simple, but the coefficients in the power series are difficult to evaluate. as a result, the problem requires simplification. instead of the exact incompressible flow past the airfoil, an approximate flow is used, which is derived from a combination of source and sink. this flow differs only slightly from the exact one when the thickness is small. by the same method, the flow with circulation is also considered. after the incompressible-flow functions are approximated in this fashion, the numerical calculation of the corresponding compressible flow, by the hodograph theory, does not present any essential difficulty.
