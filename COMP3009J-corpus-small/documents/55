separation, stability and other properties of compressible laminar boundary layer with pressure gradient and heat transfer. a theoretical study is made of the effect of pressure gradient, wall temperature, and mach number on laminar boundary-layer characteristics and, in particular, on the skin-friction and heat-transfer coefficients, on the separation point in an adverse pressure gradient, on the wall temperature required for complete stabilization of the laminar boundary layer, and on the minimum critical reynolds number for laminar stability. the prandtl number is assumed to be unity and the coefficient of viscosity is assumed to be proportional to the temperature, with a factor arising from the sutherland relation. a simple and accurate method of locating the separation point in a compressible flow with heat transfer is developed. numerical examples to illustrate the results in detail are given throughout.
