a method of computing the transient temperature of thick walls from arbitrary variation of adiabatic-wall temperature and heat-transfer coefficient. a method of calculating the temperature of thick walls has been developed in which are used relatively new concepts, such as the time series and the response to a unit triangle variation of surface temperature, together with essentially standard formulas for transient temperature and heat flow into thick walls. the method can be used without knowledge of the mathematical tools of its development. the method is particularly suitable for determining the wall temperature in one-dimensional thermal problems in aeronautics where there is a continuous variation of the heat-transfer coefficient and adiabatic-wall temperature. the method also offers a convenient means for solving the inverse problem of determining the heat-flow history when temperature history is known. a series of diversified problems were solved by exact analysis as well as by the new method. a comparison of the results shows the new method to be accurate. the labor involved is very modest in consideration of the nature of the thick-wall temperature problem. limiting solutions for the /infinitely thick/ wall and for walls so thin that thermal lag can be neglected were also obtained.
