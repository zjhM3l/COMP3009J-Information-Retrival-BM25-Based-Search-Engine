heat transfer to a hemisphere-cylinder at low reynolds numbers. measurements of the local heat flux to hemisphere-cylinder models in a supersonic rarefied air stream are presented. two different steady-state methods were developed, and five individual models were used. data were obtained throughout the mach number range of 2 to 6, with reynolds numbers (based on conditions behind the bow shock and model diameter) varying from 38 to 1730. the stagnation point data indicated a gradual increase from continuum boundary layer theory at the higher reynolds numbers to about 10 above at the lower end of the range investigated. pressure distribution measurements on cooled and uncooled models were found to agree well with modified newtonian theory. local recovery factor measurements showed a small rarefaction effect at the lowest reynolds numbers.
