buckling of thin single- and multi-layer conical and cylindrical shells with rotationally symmetric stresses. the buckling of simply supported, thin, single- and multi-layer conical shells under axially symmetrical loading is analyzed in this paper. the results are presented in a compact manner so that they may be easily used for design and/or experimental purposes. the results are compared with known experimental values.
