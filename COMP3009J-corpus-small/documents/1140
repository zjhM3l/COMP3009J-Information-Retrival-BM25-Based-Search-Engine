shock-standoff distance for spherical bodies at high mach numbers. usaf-sponsored development of a simple expression for shock-standoff distance, by consideration of an apropriate specific-heat ratio behind the shock. the theory gives predictions which are almost as accurate as those of the van dyke and hays methods.
