damage incurred on a tilt-wing multipropeller vtol/stol aircraft operating over a level, gravel-covered surface. a summary is presented of the damage experienced by a tilt-wing vtol stol aircraft as a result of operating from a level surface covered with loose gravel. the damage was inadvertently incurred as the aircraft was performing a taxiing-turn maneuver over an area of level macadam surface containing loose and embedded crushed stone. observers from a chase aircraft commented that the wing was tilted at approximately 76 with respect to the ground when the damage occurred. deposits of stone in the open fuselage, punctures in the rotor blade skin, and damage to the compressor blades of the engine occurred due to the circulation of the crushed gravel.
