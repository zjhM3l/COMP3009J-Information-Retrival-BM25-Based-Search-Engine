the effect of an internal compressible fluid column on the breathing vibrations of a thin pressurised cylindrical shell. the free oscillations of a thin pressurized cylindrical shell containing a compressible fluid are studied here. the use of an approximate set of shell equations (shallow shell theory) leads to a relatively simple formula for the natural frequencies of the coupled fluid-cylinder system. the results of some computations are presented.
