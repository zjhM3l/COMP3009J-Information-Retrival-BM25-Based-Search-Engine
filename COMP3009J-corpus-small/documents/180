boundary layer over a flat plate in presence of shear flow. the governing equations of an incompressible boundary layer over a flat plate in the presence of a shear flow with finite vorticity are derived. for large vorticity, a similarity solution is obtained. for moderate vorticity, one of the governing equations is replaced by an approximate one for which similarity solutions exist.
