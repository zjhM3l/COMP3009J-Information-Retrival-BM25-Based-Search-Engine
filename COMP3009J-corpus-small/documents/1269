a study of supersonic combustion. steady, stable, plain, and oblique detonation waves were created in a high-temperature, steady flow supersonic tunnel. ignition conditions and properties across the wave were measured. the local-wave fluid-dynamic properties agree well with detonation theory. experimental data are presented in detail and compared with other studies and theory. experimental behavior of these detonations and their possible utility are discussed.
