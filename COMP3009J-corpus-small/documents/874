the use of models for the determination of critical flutter speeds. the use of model tests in the prediction of full-scale critical flutter speeds is now well established, and the technique of such tests is therefore worthy of discussion. in order to obtain critical speeds for the model within the speed range of ordinary wind tunnels it is necessary that the model should differ in some respect from a mere small suggested by mckinnon wood the modification of the model consists in a reduction of its effective stiffnesses. this method has the defect /in most cases probably not serious/ that the model experiment is conducted at a reynolds number much below that for full-scale. in the present paper it is pointed out that an alternative method of reducing the critical speed is to increase the mass loading of the model and to make the flutter tests in compressed air. * it is then quite feasible to reach the full-scale reynolds number. this method of reducing the critical speeds by a proportionate increase of all effective densities may also be combined with a reduction of the elasticity of the model. the relation of model and full-scale stresses at the critical flutter speeds is considered. where the reduction in critical speed is effected by increase of density only, the model and full-scale stresses are equal. in a model of reduced elasticity the stresses in the wires are the same as for full-scale, whereas, the stresses in the spars are less than for full-scale. this is in accord with the usual experience that the wires of such a model are the first parts of the structure to fail in a flutter. lastly, the influence of gravity on flutter is considered. this is negligibly small for full-scale, but not necessarily so for the model. gravitational effects can sometimes be corrected by suitable orientation of the model.
