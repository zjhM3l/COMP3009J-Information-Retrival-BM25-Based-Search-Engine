laminar heat-transfer and pressure measurements over blunt-nosed cones at large angle of attack. tests have been conducted at a mach number of 6, in the pibal hypersonic facility, in order to determine the heat-transfer and pressure distributions over a slender blunted cone at angles of attack of erature ratio, stagnation to wall, was approximately 2.3. the model tested has a sperical nose diameter of 1.0 in., a base diameter of 3.75 in., and a cone half-angle of 20 degrees. the measurements were made at 5 peripheral stations on the model. in this note the experimental results at a 15 degree angle of attack are presented. a more detailed analysis of the results for all angles of attack is presented in reference 1.
