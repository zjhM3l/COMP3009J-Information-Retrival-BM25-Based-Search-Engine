the buckling of a square panel under shear, when one pair of opposite edges is clamped and the other pair is simply supported. reasons for investigation.--for an efficient design of spar with thin sheet web it is important to know the load which will just cause the web to buckle. as stiffeners divide the web into panels, it is required to find the buckling stress of rectangular panels bounded on two sides by spar flanges and on the other two sides by stiffeners. boundary conditions which represent closely this type of edge fixing are clamping (along the flanges) and simple support critical shear stress for a square panel held in this way. conclusions and further development.--it is found that the value of the critical shear stress is almost midway between its values when all four edges are clamped and all four edges are simply supported. the method of solution developed in this report is of very general application, and can be used to investigate the stability of rectangular panels when the loading is any combination of shear and compression or tension, and the edges are clamped or simply supported, and not necessarily all clamped or all simply supported. by an easy extension the method of solution can also be used to find the periods of transverse vibration of rectangular panels for the same types of loading and edge fixing.
