vorticity interaction at an axisymmetric stagnation point in a viscous incompressible fluid. the purpose of the present note is to give an exact solution of the incompressible navier-stokes equations at an axisymmetric stagnation point with vorticity in the oncoming flow which varies linearly with distance from the axis. this solution has application to the hypersonic axisymmetric blunt body problem, for which lighthill has shown the vorticity in the inviscid shock layer is very nearly of this form.
