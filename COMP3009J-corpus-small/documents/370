theoretical pressure distribution on a hemisphere-cylinder combination. in recent years great use has been made of approximate methods for the determination of the pressure distribution on blunt-nosed bodies and afterbodies at high mach numbers. for quasi-spherical bodies it has been suggested that modified newtonian theory in combination with a prandtl-meyer expansion be used on the nose portion, the two laws being matched at the point where the pressure gradients are equal. no simple approximation, however, has been found for flat-nosed bodies. as for the pressure distribution on the afterbody, the blast-wave analogy has been suggested for general nose shapes but particular afterbody profiles. the purpose of the present note is to compare these approximate estimates with a more accurate determination of the flow field about a hemisphere-cylinder in an ideal gas flow. it was felt that since experimental investigations in air at this mach number are scarce and very difficult to obtain, the comparison would be of interest. the basis of comparison is the flow field as it results from a numerical integration of the exact equations governing the motion of the ideal fluid.
