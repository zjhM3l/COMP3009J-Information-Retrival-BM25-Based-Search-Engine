a note on transitional heat transfer under hypersonic conditions. in references 1 and 2 there were presented experimental data on transitional heat transfer on a blunt body under hypersonic-flow conditions obtained by the shroud technique. the data were compared with a theoretical prediction of transitional heat transfer based on a suggestion of persh. the agreement between theory and experiment in the transitional region was found to be 'qualitatively good and quantitatively fair'. it is the purpose of this note to present some additional transitional data obtained in conventional wind-tunnel tests and to indicate a means for improving somewhat the agreement between transitional theory and experiment.
