the ground effect on the jet flap in two dimensions. this paper presents the results of the first part of an experimental investigation of the ground effect on simple jet flap aerofoils. in this part of the work an aerofoil having a 58.1 deg jet flap was tested under two-dimensional conditions. the pressure lift on the aerofoil was measured, with the ground at fixed positions, for varying jet momentum coefficients. it was found that the effect of the ground on the pressure lift was very small up to a certain critical jet coefficient. on increasing the jet coefficient beyond the critical value a marked loss of pressure lift was observed. this critical value referred to is approximately the same as the jet coefficient at which the jet first hits the ground. some significant, though highly tentative comments, are made regarding the practical application of this work to the take-off characteristics of a jet flapped aircraft.
