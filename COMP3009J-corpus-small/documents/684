tables of complete elliptic integrals. the present paper contains a set of tables of complete elliptic integrals computed and collected especially for applications to certain dynamical problems. the tabulated functions are four in number and are denoted by f/a/, g/a/, e/a/, and/a,b/respectively. the definitions of these functions and their connections with the functions of legendre will be discussed in the following.
