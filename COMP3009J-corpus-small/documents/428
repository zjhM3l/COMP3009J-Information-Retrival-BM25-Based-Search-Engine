the quasi-cylinder of specified thickness and shell loading in supersonic flow. the methods of the operational calculus are used to obtain a linear approximation to the shape of the mean camber surface of a quasi-cylinder in a supersonic flow in terms of its shell thickness and loading distributions. the analysis deals with a generalised quasi-cylinder ,. that is one which, although lying close to a mean cylinder, need not possess axial symmetry. the quasi-cylinder is also permitted to be within the small disturbance field of other separate components, e.g. a centre-body. because the linearised theory is inadmissable for internal duct flows close to and beyond the first reflected characteristic cone, the present solution is likewise invalid close to and beyond the position where this characteristic meets the mean cylinder. the work given here enables the camber shapes of /ring-wings/, which have been used theoretically to reduce or even nullify the wave-drag of a central slender-body, to be found. an example illustrates the general method.
