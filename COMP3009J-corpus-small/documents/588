compressor operation with one or more blade rows stalled. an analysis of the part-speed operating problems of high-pressure-ratio ratio multistage axial-flow compressors was made by means of a simplified stage-stacking study. the principal problems considered were poor low-speed efficiency, multiple-valued performance characteristics at intermediate speeds, and poor intermediate-speed compressor surge or stall-limit characteristics. the analysis indicated that all these problems could be attributed to discontinuities in the performance characteristics of the front stages. such discontinuities can be due to the type of stage stall or to a deterioration of stage performance resulting from stall of adjacent stages. the effects of compromises of stage matching to favor part-speed operation were also considered. this phase of the study indicated that such compromises would severly reduce the complete-compressor-stall margin. furthermore, the low-speed stage stall problem is transferred from the inlet stages to the middle stages, which are more susceptible to abrupt-stall characteristics. the analysis indicates that inlet stages having continuous performance characteristics at their stall points are desirable with respect to part-speed compressor performance. these characteristics must, however, be obtained when the stages are operating in the flow environment of the multistage compressor. alleviation of part-speed operation problems may also be obtained by improvement in either stage flow range or stage- loading margin. the results of this analysis are only qualitative. the trends obtained, however, are in agreement with those obtained from experimental studies of high-pressure-ratio multistage axial-flow compressors, and the results are valuable in developing an understanding of the off-design problem. in addition to these stage-matching studies, a general discussion of variable-geometry features such as air bleed and adjustable blades is included.
