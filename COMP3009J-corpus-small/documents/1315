performance estimates for the rae 6in. high-pressure shock tube. estimates are made of the performance of the rae 6'' high pressure shock tube, with various driver gases, over a range of pressure ratios giving shock mach numbers from 6 to 22. the calculations are based on a simplified model of shock tube flow, in which the working fluid (argon-free air) is assumed to be always in chemical equilibrium, and the driver gas (either hydrogen, or the products of combustion of a hydrogen-oxygen mixture) is assumed to behave as an ideal gas with constant specifiic heats. the results are presented in graphical form and comprise charts normal shock waves in argon-free air shock wave mach number and diaphragm pressure ratio under various initial conditions, and of the shock-induced flows, both in the uniform-sectioned shock tube, and when expanded in a divergent nozzle
