the divergence of supersonic wings including chordwise bending. the static aeroelastic stability or divergence problem is investigated for thin supersonic wings when not only the spanwise bending and twist are taken into account but also the chordwise bending. the problem is treated in successive phases of increasing complexity from the two-dimensional curling-up of the leading edge to the three-dimensional stability of the cantilever wing. several methods of approach are developed including the nonlinear aspects of the structure and the aerodynamics. results indicate a strong dependence of stability on poisson's ratio and the magnitude of the deformation.
