an approximate method for determining the displacement effects and viscous drag of laminar boundary layers in two-dimensional hypersonic flow. a simplified approximate theory is presented by means of which the laminar boundary layer over an insulated two-dimensional surface may be calculated, a linear velocity profile being assumed, and an estimate made of its effect in changing the pressure distribution over the profile upon which the boundary layer is formed. skin friction is also determined. comparisons of results from this theory are made with experimental results at a mach number of 6.86 and a reynolds number of
