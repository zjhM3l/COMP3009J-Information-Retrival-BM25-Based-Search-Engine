the elliptic cylinder in a shear flow with hyperbolic velocity profile. the stream function for the shear flow with hyperbolic velocity profile past an elliptic cylinder has been determined as an infinite series of mathieu functions. it is found that the stagnation streamline of the flow is displaced towards a region of higher velocity, this displacement increasing the main stream, (2) as the stream becomes progressively non-uniform, (3) with increase of minor axis length when the major axis length remains invariant. in each case the displacement reaches a limiting value as the cylinder moves away from the axis of symmetry of the stream. these limiting values are reached at critical distances from the axis of symmetry, which decrease as the stream becomes progressively non-uniform, but these distances are approximately independent of incidence. the pressure coefficients and the resultant force and moment coefficients associated with the cylinder have also been obtained, and investigated numerically for the flat plate type of cylinder.
