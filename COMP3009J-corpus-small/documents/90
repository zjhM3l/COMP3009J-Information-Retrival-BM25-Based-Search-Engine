periodic temperature distributions in a two-layer composite slab. an investigation to determine the feasibility of using an insulating thermal barrier to protect exposed solid propellant motors from atmospheric or environmental temperature variations has recently been completed. in one portion of this study, a solution was developed for the periodic temperature distribution in a two-layer composite slab. one exposed surface of this composite slab was adiabatic, and the other exposed surface was subjected to a sinusoidal temperature variation. the technique used in the analysis was similar to that of grober. in this note, pertinent features of the development of the solution are given.
