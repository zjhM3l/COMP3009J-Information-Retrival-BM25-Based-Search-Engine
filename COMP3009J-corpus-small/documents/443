calculated and measured pressure distributions over the midspan section of the naca 4412 airfoil. pressures were simultaneously measured in the variable-density tunnel at 54 orifices distributed over the midspan section of a 5 by 30 inch rectangular model of the n.a.c.a. 4412 airfoil at 17 angles of attack ranging from -dash 20degree to 30degree at a reynolds number of approximately 3,000,000. accurate data were thus obtained for studying the deviations of the results of potential-flow theory from measured results technique are presented. it is shown that theoretical calculations made either at the effective angle of attack or at a given actual lift do not accurately describe the observed pressure distribution over an airfoil section. there is therefore developed a modified theoretical calculation that agrees reasonably well with the measured results of the tests of the n.a.c.a. 4412 section and that consists of making the calculations and evaluating the circulation by means of the experimentally obtained lift at the effective angle of attack,. i.e., the angle that the chord of the model makes with the direction of the flow in the region of the section under consideration. in the course of the computations the shape parameter is modified, thus leading to a modified or an effective profile shape that differs slightly from the specified shape.
