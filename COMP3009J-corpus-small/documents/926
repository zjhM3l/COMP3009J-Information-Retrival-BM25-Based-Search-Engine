post buckling behaviour of circular cylinderical shells under hydrostatic pressure. the postbuckling behavior of initially perfect, thin-walled, circular cylindrical shells under hydrostatic pressure is investigated with the aid of the principle of stationary potential energy together with appropriate approximate deflection functions. calculations show that postbuckling equilibrium configurations exist for loads greater than as well as loads slightly less than the critical load calculated from small-deflection theory. loads less than the critical load are obtained only for a finite range of a parameter indicative of shell geometry. for loads corresponding to radial displacements of the order of the shell thickness, it is found that the number of circumferential waves remain essentially constant with increasing deflection and equal to the number of waves developed at buckling.
