some physical interpretations of magnetohydrodynamic duct flows. this note presents some physical interpretations of magnetohydrodynamic duct flows with various boundary conditions viewed in the light of the effects of conducting walls on the pattern of electric current, taking examples from published results on rectangular ducts. the current patterns are illustrated in fig. 1 for rectangular ducts having various combinations of conducting and nonconducting walls, a uniform magnetic field being applied in the horizontal direction.
