general characteristics of the flow through nozzles at near critical speeds. the characteristics of the position and form of the transition surface through the critical velocity are computed for flow through flat and round nozzles from subsonic to supersonic velocity. corresponding considerations were carried out for the flow about profiles in the vicinity of sonic velocity.
