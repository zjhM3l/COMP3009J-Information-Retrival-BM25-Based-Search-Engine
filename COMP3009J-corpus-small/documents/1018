note on creep buckling of columns. the results of short-time elevated-temperature creep tests of objective of obtaining procedures for predicting column lifetime. semiempirical lifetime curves are obtained with the aid of a previously published column creep theory and are used for deriving column curves. the semiempirical lifetime curves are also used to study the effect of varying applied stress and out-of-straightness. in the range considered, small variations in out-of-straightness are found to be of little practical significance,. whereas, small stress variations change the column lifetime considerably. for the range of out-of-straightness encountered in the tests, the data can be presented in plots that do not explicitly include out-of-straightness, and plots of this type should be satisfactory for predicting column lifetime for design purposes.
