review of panel flutter and effects of aerodynamic noise part i.. panel flutter. with the development of high-speed aircraft and missiles, vibration of panels has become a problem of practical significance. many of the failures of the early german rockets after attaining supersonic speed have been attributed to the development of such panel oscillations. it appears this phenomenon is not of much concern in the subsonic speed range., however, in the supersonic speed range panels may develop oscillations which cause instability of the structure. this effect has been exhibited experimentally under controlled laboratory conditions motion is limited and buckling may not be a serious design problem. in these cases panel flutter is still of importance because of its effect on the fatigue life and the allowable stresses for design of the panel material. the oscillations of panels may be due either to aerodynamic force induced by the motion of the panel, or to aerodynamic noise, or buffeting (irregular motion induced by turbulence in the flow). the interaction between aerodynamic forces and panel motions, usually referred to as /panel flutter,/ has been investigated by several workers in recent years. since the problem is too complex to be dealt with in its entirety, simplifying assumptions have been made in these investigations. the literature is marked by a certain degree of controversy over the validity of these assumptions and the applicability of the results obtained. a brief review of the literature with reference to several of the approximations made and the results obtained follows.
