unsteady aerodynamic forces on slender supersonic aircraft with flexible wings and bodies. the present paper derives generalized aerodynamic forces for slender supersonic aircraft on the basis of slender-body theory. particular consideration is given to configurations which are spanwise flexible. to treat configurations with flexible wings and bodies, the slender wing-body problem is first reduced to a simple body problem whose solution is well known, and a solution of the latter is obtained, utilizing the circle theorem or method of images and a known solution of the airfoil equation for a double interval. with this approach, it is not necessary to apply conformal mapping techniques, and the solution so obtained is valid for arbitrary spanwise downwash distributions. on the basis of slender-body theory, the velocity potential and, subsequently, the generalized aerodynamic forces are derived for a general class of spanwise flexible wing-body configurations.
