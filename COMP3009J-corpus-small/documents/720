a note on the use of sandwich structures in severe acoustic environments. this paper reviews some of the experience to date of using sandwich type structures in severe acoustic pressure environments. the methods used for testing sandwich structures for acoustic fatigue are described and their limitations considered. experimental and theoretical work relating to the damping and mode-frequency relationships of certain sandwich configurations is also reviewed. special attention is given to the estimation of the stress in the bond of a honeycomb sandwich panel subjected to sudden pressure fluctuations. a /uni-modal/ theory is presented, relating the mean-square bond-stress to the random exciting pressure and panel dynamic characteristics. this theory indicates that tensile bond stresses may be encountered of up to six times the local r.m.s. exciting pressure. these must be combined with bending and shear stresses to obtain the principal stresses which precipitate bond fatigue failures. finally, an outline is given of some of the lines of future research which should lead to the achieving of the maximum possible fatigue resistance from sandwich configurations.
