conduction of heat in a solid with a power law of heat transfer at its surface. the nonlinear boundary value problem, where and m are constants, is solved formally by first introducing power series in t for the unknown temperature and flux at the surface and then determining the coefficients in those series. in this manner the temperature function is determined as a series of repeated integrals of error functions. the convergence is rapid only for small values of t. the special cases and generalizations of the condition at the surface for which the same method applies, are noted. surface temperatures are also found by methods of difference equations, where t is not limited to small values. graphs of these temperatures corresponding to various laws of heat transfer at the surface are shown.
