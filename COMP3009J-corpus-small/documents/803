the shock pattern of a wing-body combination far from the flight path. the position and strength of the front shock wave at large distances from a wing-body combination, are deduced from the linear theory for the combination, using a method developed by whitham. the combination consists of a body of revolution and a wing which has thickness and is lifting. the effects of interference between the flow over the body and the flow over the wing are included. in any direction the flow far from the wing-body combination is equivalent to the flow past a body of revolution determined from the configuration of the combination. the modified formulae for unsteady flow are given and some results are evaluated for the combination of a body of revolution and a delta wing with subsonic leading edges.
