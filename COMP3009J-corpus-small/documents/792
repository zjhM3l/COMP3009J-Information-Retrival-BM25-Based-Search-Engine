some low speed problems of high speed aircraft. the first part of the paper deals with the low speed aerodynamics of aircraft shapes suggested by kuchemann, at the second international congress in aeronautical sciences at zurich in 1960, as suitable for achieving a required range at supersonic speeds, namely wingbody arrangements with sweepback angles of 55degrees or 60degrees and streamwise thickness-chord ratio of about 5 per cent suitable for low supersonic speed, and slender near-triangular wings with sharp leading edges suitable for mach numbers of about 2 or more. no attention is given to /slewed/ wings, powered lift or variable geometry. in dealing briefly with swept wings, the need for avoiding separation of flow from the leading edge is demonstrated, with the conclusion that it is desirable to use leading edge flaps with blowing or suction at the knee together with blown trailing edge flaps. wind tunnel tests are described on a simplified model with these boundary layer control methods applied. mention is made of the possibility of adverse ground effect on maximum lift. more attention is given to the case of slender wings because their use involves a new type of flow with separation from all edges. this flow and its steadiness are therefore discussed from the point of view of the possibility of buffeting,. the effect of plan form on static longitudinal stability and pitch-up is analysed,. and a short summary of available results on damping in pitch is given. large rolling moments due to sideslip are shown to give rise to serious problems of control, and the present state of knowledge of static lateral and directional stability and rolling and yawing rotary derivatives is discussed. finally the effects of proximity to the ground are summarised. the second part of the paper is concerned with work aimed at clarifying some of the requirements for handling qualities of future aircraft. it is not so much concerned with forecasts of the dynamic behaviour of these future aircraft as with determining what the pilot wants. two aspects of control in the vertical plane are discussed in some detail namely speed control and glide path holding. flight tests on an avro 707a aircraft, with artificially worsened characteristics, are described, and it is shown that substantially constant performance in the piloting task can be achieved at the expense of increased pilot effort. some tentative conclusions on desirable levels of speed stability and phugoid damping are, nevertheless, drawn. a brief review of the present status of lateral/directional handling requirements, using mainly american data, is also included.
