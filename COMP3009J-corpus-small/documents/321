improved numerical solution of the blasius problem with three-point boundary conditions. the blasius equation describes the velocity distribution resulting from laminar, constant-pressure mixing of a stationary fluid layer and a moving stream. in connection with a numerical procedure for the univac based on analytic continuation of the function f'. high-speed computers now make it feasible to use analytic continuation for numerical integration of single-point boundary-value problems such that, within the limits of taylor's expansion, truncation error may be made arbitrarily small. a brief description of the application of the routine is given.
