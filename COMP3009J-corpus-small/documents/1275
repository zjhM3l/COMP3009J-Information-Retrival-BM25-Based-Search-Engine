flow about an unsteadily rotating disc. an analysis is made of the unsteady laminar flow about a rotating disc whose angular velocity may vary with time. the deviation of the actual instantaneous state of the flow from the quasi-steady state (instantaneous steady state) is determined. from this, a simplified criterion, is derived to define the conditions under which the flow can be considered as quasi-steady for the purposes of shear stress and torque computations. since a turbulent flow responds more rapidly than a laminar flow, the quasi-steady criterion found here should also serve for the turbulent situation.
