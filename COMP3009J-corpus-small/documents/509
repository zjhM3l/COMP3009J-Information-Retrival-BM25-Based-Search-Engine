a graphical approximation for temperatures and sublimation rates at surfaces subjected to small net and large gross heat transfer rates. considers a material, acted upon by heat of conduction, which changes its state by sublimation at the heated surface. the derived method is most suitable under conditions of severe heating such as space vehicle re-entry.
