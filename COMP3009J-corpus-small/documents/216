the supersonic axial flow compressor. an investigation has been made to explore the possibilities of axial-flow compressors operating with supersonic velocities into the blade rows. preliminary calculations showed that very high pressure ratios across a stage, together with somewhat increased mass flows, were apparently possible with compressors which decelerated air through the speed of sound in their blading. the first phase of this investigation, which has been reported in naca acr l5d20, was the development of efficient supersonic diffusers to decelerate air through the speed of sound. the present report is largely a general discussion of some of the essential aerodynamics of single-stage supersonic axial-flow compressors. in the supersonic flow about isolated bodies, large energy losses usually occur due to wave systems which extend far from the bodies. supersonic flow entering a cascade is considered and, in this case, the possibility of entirely eliminating this extended wave system is demonstrated,. thus, no reason for supersonic compressors to be necessarily inefficient is apparent. the conditions that occur as the flow through the compressor is being started are discussed and a hypothesis as to the type of transonic flow which will be encountered is proposed. as an approach to the study of supersonic compressors, three possible velocity diagrams are discussed briefly. because of the encouraging results of this study, an experimental single-stage supersonic compressor has been constructed and tested in freon-12. in this compressor, air decelerates through the speed of sound in the rotor blading and enters the stators at subsonic speeds. a pressure ratio of about 1.8 at an efficiency of about 80 percent has been obtained.
