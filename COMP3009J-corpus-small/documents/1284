the transition to tubulence in a boundary layer on a blunt cone in supersonic flow. experiments were made with a series of cones, each having an included angle of 15 degrees, and having different tip radii (sharp to blunt nose). the cones were tested in streams, undisturbed mach numbers of 3.12 and 3.81, and the position of transition to turbulence was observed with a shadowgraph technique. for each mach number the distance to transition (distance downstream from the tip of the cone) increased with increase in tip radius, reached a maximum at a certain tip radius, and then decreased with increase in tip radius. a study indicates that a reynolds number based on the momentum thickness, instead of the length from tip to transition, is a more appropriate parameter for correlating the data. the research scientist active in this field probably would derive the most benefit from the original paper.
