an investigation of the effect of downwash from a vtol aircraft and a helicopter in the ground environment. dynamic-pressure measurement, in ground effect, have been obtained about a single-rotor helicopter and a dual-propeller vtol aircraft. the results indicate that the slipstream dynamic pressure along the ground, some distance from the center of rotation, is not a function of disk loading but merely a function of the gross weight or thrust of the aircraft. furthermore, for a given gross weight the thickness of this outward flowing sheet of air is less for a small-diameter propeller (higher disk loading propeller). the variation of the dynamic-pressure flow field for single and dual propellers or rotors is significantly different in the plane of symmetry between the two rotors than in a direction normal to this plane. the interaction of the two flows produces a region of upflow in this plane where the fuselage is located, and the decay of the maximum dynamic pressure with distance ahead of the fuselage is slower.
