heat flow in composite slabs. this paper presents the solution of the heat flow problem in composite walls under heat transfer conditions which are typical of uncooled rocket engine walls. analytic expressions in the form of fourier sums are obtained for the temperature distribution in a composite wall consisting of an inner (refractory) medium and an outer metallic) medium under newtonian heat transfer into the first medium with negligible heat transfer from the second medium to the exterior. the expressions obtained are based on a plane parallel composite slab as a representative model for relatively thin cylindrical walls, with thickness-to-radius ratio not exceeding 0.2. the general results for the composite slab are simplified for the limiting cases of a thin refractory shield with a thick shielded medium and a thick refractory shield with a thin shielded medium.
