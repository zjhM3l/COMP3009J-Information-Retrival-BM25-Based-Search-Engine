a second order shock-expansion method applicable to bodies of revolution near zero lift. a second-order shock-expansion method applicable to bodies of revolution near zero lift is developed. expressions defining the pressures on noninclined bodies are derived by the use of characteristics theory in combination with properties of the flow predicted by the generalized shock-expansion method. this result is extended to inclined bodies to obtain expressions for the normal-force and pitching-moment derivatives at zero angle of attack. the method is intended for application under conditions between the ranges of applicability of the second-order potential theory and the generalized shock-expansion mehtod - namely, when the ratio of free-stream mach number to nose fineness ratio is in the neighborhood of 1. for noninclined bodies, the pressure distributions predicted by the second-order shock-expansion method are compared with existing experimental results and with predictions of other theories. for inclined bodies, the normal-force derivatives and locations of the center of pressure at zero angle of attack predicted by the method are compared with experimental results for mach numbers from 3.00 to 6.28. fineness ratio 7, 5, and 3 cones and tangent ogives were tested alone and with cylindrical afterbodies up to 10 diameters long. in general, the predictions of the present method are found to be in good agreement with the experimental results. for non-inclined bodies, pressure distributions predicted with the method are in good agreement with existing experimental results and with distributions obtained with the method of characteristics. for inclined bodies, the normal-force derivatives per radian (for normal-force coefficients referenced to body base area) are predicted within 0.2 and the locations of the center of pressure are predicted within 0.2 body diameters. on the basis of these results, the second-order shock-expansion method appears applicable for values of the ratio of free-stream mach number to nose fineness ratio from 0.4 to 2.
