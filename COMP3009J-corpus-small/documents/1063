on obtaining solutions to the navier-stokes equations with high speed digital computers. the purpose of this paper is to show how to obtain steady state solutions to the navier-stokes equations on a high-speed digital computer. first the relative merits of various finite difference formulae are discussed. thereafter the main part of the paper is concerned with the methods used to solve the finite difference equations and an investigation is made of all the simpler iterative methods.
