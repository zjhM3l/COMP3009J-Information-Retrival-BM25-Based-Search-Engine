a collection of longitudinal stability derivatives of wings at supersonic speeds. a collection has been made of theoretical data, for wings alone, on those stability derivatives that govern the short-period oscillation of aircraft travelling at supersonic speeds. all the derivatives available have been obtained by means of the linear theory, and so the information given is subject to the usual limitations. the information has been presented in what is hoped is the most convenient form to show its extent, and to expose the parts of the field where experimental investigation is most needed.
