measurements of pitching moment derivatives for blunt-nose aerofoils oscillating in two-dimensional supersonic flow. direct pitching moment derivatives have been measured using the method of scruton, woodgate et al for two single wedge blunt-nosed aerofoils. these measurements were made at mach numbers of 1.75 and 2.47 and frequency parameters less than 0.02. in general, nose blunting was found to have little effect on the derivatives although changes were observed for the thinner wedge at a mach number of 1.75.
