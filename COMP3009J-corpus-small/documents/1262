an extension of the linearized characteristics method for calculating the supersonic flow around elliptic cones. the method of linearized characteristics as applied by ferri to the flow about elliptic cones can be used to determine the surface pressure distribution, even when only linear terms are kept in the boundary conditions, provided an area rule requirement is satisfied. in addition, the method can be applied for angles of attack provided the elliptic body geometry is specified in a manner that does not distort the cross section. the surface pressure distribution obtained by this modified method is in reasonable agreement with experiment over the range of mach numbers and semidiameter ratios considered. experimental results for several conical bodies are presented.
