calibration of the standard pitot-static head used in the rae low speed wind tunnels. recent results of tests in the r.a.e. wind tunnels concerned with the measurement of pressure distributions have shown slight discrepancies between the readings of various static pressure tubes and calculated pressure distributions. as a consequence some doubt was felt concerning the calibrations of tunnel static pressure and upon the validity of the reading given by the standard pitot-static head. it was therefore decided to check the standard pitot-static head used in the r.a.e. wind tunnels, against an instrument similar to the measurements of static pressure were also made using a long tube where the interference from head and support is calculated to be small. this note gives the results of tests made in the 5 ft open jet wind tunnel and the no. 1 11 ft wind tunnel in order to determine the necessary correction to the reading of static pressure given by the r.a.e. pitot-static head. the tests were made during september and october, 1951.
