some effects of wind-tunnel interference observed in tests on two-dimensional aerofoils at high subsonic and transonic speeds. in the high-speed research on two-dimensional aerofoils at the national physical laboratory the need to keep model size above a certain minimum, in order to reproduce correctly the boundary layer separation effects experienced at full scale, has been considered paramount even at the risk of incurring significant tunnel interference effects. this report discusses the interference effects for the slotted working sections now in use. the magnitudes of the blockage and lift effect corrections are deduced for the ratio of model chord to tunnel height normally used. it is shown that a simple adaptation to reduce the open area of the walls would reduce both corrections to insignificant proportions simultaneously, but would give a reduced choking mach number separated flows. the observed trends in the variation of the blockage effects for other ratios of model chord to tunnel height differ from those predicted theoretically, and so the results cannot be applied more generally until these trends have been checked by further investigations. it is suggested that wake interference effects can significantly influence the manner in which separated flows develop with increasing incidence or mach number, particularly for walls of small open area. examples are also given of effects of distortions in the local supersonic flow, which are most noticeable for walls with relatively large open areas.
