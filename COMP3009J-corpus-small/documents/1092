wing-nacelle-propeller interference for wings of various spans. force and pressure distribution tests. an experimental investigation was made in the n. a. c. a. full-scale wind tunnel to determine the effect of wing span on nacelle-propeller characteristics and, reciprocally, the lateral extent of nacelle and propeller influence on a monoplane wing. the results provide a check on the validity of the previous research on nacelles and propellers with 15-foot-span wings tested in the the scale propeller and the n. a. c. a. cowling used in the former researches were tested in three typical tractor locations with respect to a thick wing of 5-foot chord and 30-foot span. the span was progressively reduced to 25,20, and 15 feet and the same characteristics were measured in each case. the efficiency factors--propulsive efficiency, nacelle drag efficiency, and net efficiency--were obtained for each wing length by means of force tests and the values are compared to determine the effect of span. pressure-distribution measurements show the lateral extent of the nacelle interference and the propeller-slipstream effect on the span loading for the various conditions. complete polar curves and curves showing the variation of nacelle drag with lift coefficient are also included. force and pressure-distribution tests concur in indicating that, for engineering purposes, the influence of a nacelle and of a propeller, in a usual combination, may be considered to extend laterally on a wing the same maximum distance, or about five nacelle diameters or two propeller diameters outboard of their common axes. all important effects of scale nacelle-propeller combinations may be measured within practical limits of accuracy by tests of a 15-foot-span wing.
