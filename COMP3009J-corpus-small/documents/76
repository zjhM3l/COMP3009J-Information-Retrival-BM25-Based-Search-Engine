flight measurement of wall pressure fluctuations and boundary-layer turbulence. the results are presented for a flight test program using a fighter type jet aircraft flying at pressure altitudes of 10,000, 20,000, and apparatus was used to measure and record the output of microphones and hot-wire anemometers mounted on the forward-fuselage section and wing of the airplane. mean-velocity profiles in the boundary layers were obtained from total-pressure measurements. the ratio of the root-mean-square fluctuating wall pressure to the free-stream dynamic pressure is presented as a function of reynolds number and mach number. the longitudinal component of the turbulent-velocity fluctuations was measured, and the turbulence-intensity profiles are presented for the wing and forward-fuselage section. in general, the results are in agreement with wind-tunnel measurements which have been reported in the literature. for example, the variation of (is the root mean square of the wall-pressure fluctuation, and q is the free-stream dynamic pressure) with reynolds number was found to be essentially constant for the forward fuselage-section boundary layer, while variations at the wing station were probably unduly affected by the microphone diameter, which was large compared with the boundary-layer thickness.
