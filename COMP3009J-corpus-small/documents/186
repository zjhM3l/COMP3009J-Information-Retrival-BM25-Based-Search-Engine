base pressure in supersonic flow. the problem of accurately predicting the pressure and wake configuration at the base of bodies in supersonic flow is an extremely important one inasmuch as a sizeable portion of the total drag of a given body may be attributable to the low pressure in this region. although a great deal of theoretical and experimental work has been done in this field, there does not yet exist a satisfactory method for accurate predictions. this paper represents an excellent effort to experimentally confirm analytically deduced concepts. a large amount of experimental data on body shapes such as wedges, cones, and cone-cylinders has been obtained over a range of mach numbers up to 4. the data are thoroughly discussed with respect to analytical deductions. on the basis of the evidence accumulated it is concluded that the boundary-layer thickness has only a small effect on the base pressure for axisymmetric bodies and for two-dimensional bodies when the base height-to-chord ratios are of the order. reviewer believes this report is a significant contribution in the field of base pressure and wake flow phenomena.
