the problem of obtaining high lift-drag ratios at supersonic speeds. the importance of the lift to drag ratio is well known to all aircraft designers since it gives, to a great extent, the aerodynamic efficiency of the airplane. aerodynamic efficiency, however, is only one component of the grand compromise that a completed airplane represents. at subsonic speeds, lift-drag ratios of well over 200 have been measured in wind tunnels on airfoil sections., but few powered aircraft have attained (lift to drag ratio) value of 20. it is invariably true that the requirements of stability and control, structure, and flight operation all contribute to reducing the design (lift to drag ratio) considerably below those exotic values which can be predicted from unrestricted aerodynamic theory. if, however, a certain range or operating efficiency is required, there is most certainly a minimum if we examine the range equation we see that range is proportional to the lift-drag ratio, the thermopropulsive efficiency, and the logarithm of the initial to final weight ratio. the appearance of the lift-drag ratio as a linear factor in the range equation indicates that every attempt should be made to increase (lift to drag ratio)., however, the search for higher (lift to drag ratio) may lead to strange and unorthodox configurations. most frequently, such configurations are ruled out by the adverse effects of their geometry on the weight ratios. in the present paper, we will deal with the maximum lift-drag ratio problem for conventional configurations having a wing and a body in close proximity to each other. no attempt will be made to select a particular configuration as being the best. however, the promising direction to go from the aerodynamic view will be stressed with the understanding that the other factors may outweight the aerodynamics.
