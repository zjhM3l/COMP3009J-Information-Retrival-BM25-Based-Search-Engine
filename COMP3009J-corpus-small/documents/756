further comments on the inversion of large structural matrices. in a recent note, klein referred to a paper co-authored by the writer, and to ref. 3. regarding the subject of inversion of large-order matrices, klein stated that he would show 'that the situation is not as hopeless as the anove-mentioned authors intimate'. the purpose of this note is not to take exception to klein/s conclusions, but rather to disagree with his implication that the authors of ref. 2 were pessimistic with respect to large-matrix inversions. two general methods of analysis were treated.. the method of consistent distortion and the method of transfer matrices. the first method leads directly to a relatively large matrix of structural coefficients of both internal forces and displacements. this matrix must be inverted to solve the problem. the second method ultimately produces a relatively small matrix requiring inversion., however, to arrive at this point one must perform a number of matrix multiplications.
