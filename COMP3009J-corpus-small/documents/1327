on the propagation and structure of the blast wave. concerning blast waves with front surfaces of plane, cylindrical and spherical shape, the propagation velocity u and the distribution of hydrodynamical quantities are discussed. the solutions are constructed in the form of power series in (c u), where c is the sound velocity of undisturbed fluid. especially r, the distance of shock front from the charge, is represented as, where r is the characteristic length related to the energy of explosion, j and are constants, and a=0,1,2 correspond to plane, cylindrical and spherical case, respectively. in this paper the first approximations for a=0,1 are discussed (the case a=2 has been discussed by g. i. taylor). the solution is obtained numerically for the case of the adiabatic index. the approximate solution is also considered. using these solutions, is found to be. the second approximation will appear in part 2 to be published subsequently.
