the nonlinear conical spring. the large symmetric deformations of shallow conical shells are of interest in the design of nonlinear conical disk springs. in most applications a uniformly distributed axial load acts at the inner and outer edges,. these edges are otherwise free. several approximations have been proposed to describe the behavior of these springs. a first approximation (1) is based on the assumption that meridional strains are negligible. this requires that the shell remain conical after deformation and also that the extensional strain of meridional lines on the middle surface vanish. another approximation (2) retains only the assumption that the shell remains conical. the first assumption satisfies neither of the two boundary conditions at the free edges,. the latter violates the condition of vanishing moment at the free edges. recently the authors presented a series solution (3) for a special case, namely, the case of an annular plate under similar loading. numerical solutions for the shallow conical shell under these conditions of load have also been obtained (4). an examination of these results indicates that the meridional bending stresses are of much smaller magnitude than the circumferential bending stresses. hence the present analysis is based on the neglect of the meridional bending moment.
