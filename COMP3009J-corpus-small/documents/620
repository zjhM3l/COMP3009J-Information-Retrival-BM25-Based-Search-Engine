earth satellite observations and the upper atmosphere. atmospheric densities have been derived from artificial satellites in altitudes 200-700 km. and from rockets up to about 200 km. to consolidate the two sets of data, h.k. kallmann suggested a model with a exact form of this curve has now been derived. corrections for the is excellent. very close correlation between atmospheric density variations/h180 km./ and the solar 20-cm. radiation implies that the origin of the'solar effect'may lie in the absorption of solar ultra-violet radiation. the atmospheric density curve between 180 and 200 km. shows a temperature inversion in the fl-layer. it is not yet possible to decide whether solar ultra-violet radiation as well as the solar he line and solar x-ray radiation contribute to the heating of the fl-layer. diurnal and seasonal density variations at altitudes 210, 562 and 660 km. have been derived from variations in acceleration of three satellites/sputnik 3, vanguard 1 and 2/. group averages of diurnal variations are taken from different dates within the period may 15, 1958-october 1, 1959. physcal conditions in the upper atmosphere are briefly summarized..the'solar effect'originates in the fl-layer as a result of heating by the solar he line at 304 a. diurnal density variation at 210 km. is only a few per cent. absorption of solar electromagnetic radiation in the f2-layer, and large heat conductivity cause intense diurnal density and temperature variations above
