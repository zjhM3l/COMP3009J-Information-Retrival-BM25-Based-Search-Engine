stagnation point heat transfer measurements at super satellite speeds. brief description of experiments performed by using shock tube techniques for measurement of the stagnation point heating of a blunt body over a stagnation enthalpy range of 650 to 900, corresponding to velocities between 32,000 ft. per sec. and 39,000 ft per sec., respectively. data thus provided are used for comparison with theory.
