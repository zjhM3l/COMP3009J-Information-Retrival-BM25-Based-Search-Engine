steady-state creep through dislocation climb. a dislocation climb creep model is considered which does not require the production of immobile dislocations. the creep equation that results from the analysis is where a and b are constants, is the stress, q is the activation energy of creep and kt has its usual meaning. this equation is quite similar to one previously proposed.
