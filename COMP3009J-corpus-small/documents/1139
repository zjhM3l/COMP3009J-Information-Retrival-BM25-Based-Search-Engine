the effect of entrance velocity on the flow of a rarefied gas, through a tube. the flow of a rarefied gas through a circular tube is considered. molecules entering the tube have a mass velocity directed down the tube, as well as a randomly directed thermal velocity. it is assumed that the conditions for free-molecule flow hold, and that molecules striking the tube wall are reflected diffusely. the mass velocity and tube dimensions are restricted only by the limitation to free-molecule flow. the theory is illustrated by an example of the effect of an entrance tube on the measurement of pressure and density by a gage placed on a satelite.
