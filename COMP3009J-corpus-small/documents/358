on the model of the free shock separation, turbulent boundary layer. by free shock-separated boundary layers, one means that type of separation where the flow downstream of the separation region is free to adjust to any direction that may result from the shock-boundary-layer interaction process. a detailed model of the free shock-separated turbulent boundary layer is postulated, and the pressure rise following from this model is estimated and compared with experiments. the results are applied to the prediction of separation in an overexpanded nozzle.
