transformation of the compressible turbulent boundary layer. the transformation of the compressible turbulent boundary- layer equations to their incompressible equivalent is demonstrated analytically. the transformation is essentially the same as that for the laminar layer, first given by stewartson, except that the explicit relation between the viscosity and temperature is not required. a key point in the analysis is the modification of the stream function to include a mean of the fluctuating components and the postulate that the apparent turbulent shear, associated with an elemental mass, remains invariant in the transformation. the values of the incompressible friction coefficients and of pressure rise causing separation thus transformed show good agreement with the experimentally measured and independently reported results. an application of the transformation to the self-preserving boundary layers and to the computations of general boundary-layer flow is shown.
