on the solution of the laminar boundary layer equations. the problem of the flow along a flat plate placed edgewise to a steady stream, when a retarding pressure gradient varying linearly as the distance x from the leading edge of the plate is superposed is discussed. if y denotes distance measured perpendicular to the plate, a solution is obtained in the form of a power series in x where coefficients are functions of. differential equations are obtained for these coefficients. seven of the coefficients have been obtained with reasonable accuracy, and the eighth and ninth roughly. unfortunately it appears that about eight more terms are required to carry the solution to the point of separation,. the work involved in their determination is prohibitive. two approximate methods have been developed for determining the error when the first seven terms of the series are used as an approximation. these methods lead to the determination of the point of separation and are in agreement as to its position. if is the velocity at the edge of the boundary layer at the leading edge of the plate and is the velocity gradient, separation is found when. a method is developed for the solution of the boundary layer equations in any retarded region. it is obtained by replacing the velocity distribution at the edge of the boundary layer by a circumscribing polygon of infinitesimal sides and applying the preceding solution to each of these sides, making the momentum integral continuous at each vortex. the problem is thereby reduced to the solution of a first order differential equation.
