new test techniques for a hypervelocity wind tunnel. the measurement of rocket exhaust effects on vehicle stability and the measurement of aerodynamic damping were made in an arc-discharge type of hypervelocity wind tunnel. sample data are given to indicate the quality of data obtainable in this tunnel, and samples of self-luminous and shadowgraph photographs are also presented.
