determination of upper-atmosphere air density profile from satellite observations. the theory previously developed for the changes in the perigee distance and semi-major axis of a satellite orbit due to air drag is extended to enable the air-density profile/i.e.its relative variation with height/to be derived from the motion of the orbit's perigee. the solution is first obtained in terms of the change in perigee distance and then in terms of the change in the radius of the earth at the sub-perigee point the scale height in the 180 and 220 km altitude regions.
