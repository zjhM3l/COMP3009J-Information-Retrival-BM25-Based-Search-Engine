an analysis of base pressure at supersonic velocities and comparison with experiment. in the first part of the investigation an analysis is made of base pressure in an inviscid fluid, both for two-dimensional and axially symmetric flow. it is shown that for two-dimensional flow, and also for the flow over a body of revolution with a cylindrical sting attached to the base, there are an infinite number of possible solutions satisfying all necessary boundary conditions at anh given free-stream mach numger. for the particular case of a body having no sting attached only one solution is possible in an inviscid flow, but it corresponds to zero base drag. accordingly, it is concluded that a strictly inviscid-flow theory cannot be satisfactory for practical applications. an approximate semi-empirical analysis for base pressure in a viscous fluid is developed in a second part of the investigation. the semi-empirical analysis is based partly on inviscid-flow calculations. in this theory an attempt is made to allow for the effects of mach number, reynolds number, profile shape, and type of boundary-layer flow. some measurements of base pressure in two-dimensional and axially symmetric flow are presented for purposes of comparison. experimental results then are presented concerning the support interference effect of a cylindrical sting, and the interference effect of a reflected air wave on measurements of base pressure in a supersonic wind tunnel.
