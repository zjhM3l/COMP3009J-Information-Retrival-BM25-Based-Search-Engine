the equilibrium piston technique for gun tunnel operation. a modified technique for the operation of a gun tunnel is suggested based on experimental results. if the piston mass and the initial barrel pressure are chosen correctly, then the peak pressures associated with the gun tunnel may be eliminated. under these conditions the piston is brought to rest with no overswing. some measurements of the piston motion using a microwave technique are reported which confirm this idea. the wave diagram associated with this mode of operation is shown, and some calculations of the stagnation pressure are given which show that during the suggested running time, the stagnation pressure may be considerably greater than the driving pressure if the driving chamber cross-sectional area is large compared with that of the driven section. for a uniform shock tube the stagnation pressure will always be less than the driving pressure. the use of air, helium and hydrogen as driving gases has been considered. experiments in a gun tunnel are reported which show that the equilibrium piston technique enables steady stagnation pressures to be achieved over a time of approximately 15 ms using air as the driving gas. the expansion caused by the piston acceleration is shown to interact with the stationary piston, but this is found to produce only a small drop in stagnation pressure.
