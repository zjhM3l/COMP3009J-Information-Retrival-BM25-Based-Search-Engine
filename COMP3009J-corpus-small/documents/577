on hypersonic similitude. tsien in a recent paper (j. math. phys. mass. inst. tech. sonic flows around slender bodies and has pointed out that the product of mach number and fineness ratio is a basic similarity parameter. the author enlarges on this notion, indicating that the problem of hypersonic flow about a slender body in three dimensions is the same as that of a certain two-dimensional nonsteady flow (with time replacing the lengthwise spatial coordinate) characterized by essentially the same similarity parameter.
