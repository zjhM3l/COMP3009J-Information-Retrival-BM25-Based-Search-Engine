numerical technique to lifting surface theory for calculation of unsteady aerodynamic forces due to continuous sinusoidal gusts on several wing planforms at sobsonic speeds. a numerical lifting-surface method has been used to calculate direct gust forces and moments on wings of several planforms. the gust velocities are continuous and vary sinusoidally in the stream direction and are also uniform across the wing span. the procedure has the advantage of rapid machine calculation and includes the effects of wing planform, nonsteady subsonic flow, and induced flow effects. the method provides for calculation of gust forces on a basis consistent with that for the calculation of forces due to motion and deformation. the results include the in-phase and quadrature components of the following quantities.. (a) spanwise distribution of section lift coefficient, (b) total lift coefficient, and (c) total pitching-moment coefficient. in addition, generalized gust forces on approximate fundamental cantilever bending modes ( parabolic) are also included. results have been obtained for 60 and 75 delta wings, ratio 11.60, and an unswept wing of aspect ratio 6.00. conditions for which calculations were made include two mach numbers reduced-frequency range of 0 to 1.0. the direct gust forces and moments are in forms suitable to be inserted in equations of motion used in the calculation of the dynamic responses of flexible lifting vehicles to random turbulence and to be compared with results from other methods.
