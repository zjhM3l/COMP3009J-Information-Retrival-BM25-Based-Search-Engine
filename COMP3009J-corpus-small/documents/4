approximate solutions of the incompressible laminar boundary layer equations for a plate in shear flow. the two-dimensional steady boundary-layer problem for a flat plate in a shear flow of incompressible fluid is considered. solutions for the boundary- layer thickness, skin friction, and the velocity distribution in the boundary layer are obtained by the karman-pohlhausen technique. comparison with the boundary layer of a uniform flow has also been made to show the effect of vorticity.
