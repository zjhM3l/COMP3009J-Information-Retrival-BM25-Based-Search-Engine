buckled states of circular plates. authors discuss the thin elastic circular disk of constant thickness subjected to a constant compressive thrust applied at its edge. the analysis presented is based upon the nonlinear von karman equations of plate theory and is applied to disks with completely clamped and completely, simply supported edges.
