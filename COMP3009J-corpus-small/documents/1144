slipstream flow around several tilt-wing vtol aircraft models operating near the ground. a collection of data from a number of brief investigations made with three different models to determine the character of the slipstream flow along the ground is presented for multiple-propeller tilt-wing vtol aircraft configurations operating near the ground. in general, the tests involved tuft surveys and slipstream dynamic-pressure measurements for several tilt-wing vtol models. a more extensive series of tests, including some measurements of the erosion of gravel by the slipstream and some measurements of the unsteady rolling, yawing, and pitching moments, was also made on one of the models operating in the hovering condition near the ground. the results of the flow studies indicated the presence of a stronger and deeper slipstream flow along the center line of the aircraft, and to some extent along parallel planes between adjacent propellers (on one wing), than to the side of the aircraft. this effect is caused by an intensification of the individual slipstreams as they meet at the planes of flow symmetry. the intensified flow along the center line of the aircraft is amplified by the presence of the fuselage and causes the dynamic pressure to be greater in front of the aircraft than would be expected on the basis of the slipstream of the individual propellers. in the erosion tests it was found that gravel, if sufficiently small, was rapidly eroded by the slipstream and that this gravel could be thrown high into the air if it struck even very small fixed obstacles on the ground (obstacles with a height less than the diameter of the gravel). results of the investigation of moment fluctuations indicated that there are large, erratic variations of rolling, yawing, and pitching moments and that the propellers, reacting to an erratic inflow from the recirculating slipstream, are the primary source of these moments.
