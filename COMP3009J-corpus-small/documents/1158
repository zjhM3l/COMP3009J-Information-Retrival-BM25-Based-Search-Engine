the tailored-interface hypersonic shock tunnel. the /tailored-interface/ hypersonic shock tunnel provides a means for producing the high mach number, high stagnation temperature flow conditions encountered in hypersonic flight. various gasdynamic phenomena associated with shock tunnels are discussed, and experimental evidence of the successful application of this technique is presented. as an indication of its research application, the results of heat-transfer experiments on a hemisphere-cylinder model are presented and compared with theory.
