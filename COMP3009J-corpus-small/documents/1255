the flow about a charged body moving in the lower atmosphere. the flow about an electrically charged body traveling at high speeds through the lower ionosphere is analyzed. a simple gas model composed of electrons, ions, and neutral particles is used and the hydrodynamic description given is based on maxwell's transfer equations for a mixture. the conditions under which local statistical equilibrium can be assumed are discussed, and different approaches to determine the gasdynamic force in the subsonic, supersonic, and hypersonic cases are indicated. the reciprocal action of the electric field of the flow on the body is also analyzed and a formula for the resultant electric force is given. the total force on the body is equal to the sum of the gasdynamic force and the electric force. the negative potential acquired by a plane body is also calculated. finally, the lack of validity of debye's linearization in this case and the solution of the exterior nonlinear problem which characterize the electric potential and the electron distribution are discussed.
