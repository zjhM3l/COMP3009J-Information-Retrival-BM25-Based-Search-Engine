on structural fatigue under random loading. experience has shown that the fluctuating loads induced by a jet may cause fatigue failure of aircraft structural components. in order to throw some light on this and similar problems, the stress spectrum and the /equivalent fatigue stress/ of an elastic structure subjected to random loading are studied. the analysis is simplified by assuming the structure to have only a single degree of freedom and by using the concept of cumulative damage, the results being expressed in terms of quantities that can be directly measured. as an example, a similarity expression for the probable value of the equivalent fatigue stress of a panel subjected to jet buffeting is derived.
