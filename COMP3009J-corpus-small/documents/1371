axisymmetric free mixing with swirl. viscous laminar axially-symmetric free-mixing with small, moderate, and large swirl is investigated by a boundary layer type of analysis with integral methods. moderate and small swirls are formally the same, differing only in the order of their associated radial pressure gradients. neither induces significant axial pressure gradients,. consequently their effect on the axial flow is negligible. for moderate and small swirl an interesting feature is the swirl decay. in both compressible and incompressible flow, it is shown that jet swirl decays more rapidly than wake swirl whereas both swirls decay more rapidly than the non-uniformity in axial velocity. large swirl generates axial pressure gradients as well as large radial pressure gradients, and therefore alters the streamwise flow. examples calculated for incompressible flow, show that the wake is lengthened by large swirl. it is expected that this effect will be diminished in the presence of higher free-stream mach numbers which lead to decreased densities, due to decreased centrifugal effects, decreased radial pressure gradients, and decreased axial pressure gradients.
