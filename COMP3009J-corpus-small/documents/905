comparative tests of pitot-static tubes. comparative tests were made on seven conventional pitot-static tubes to determine their static, dynamic, and resultant errors. the effect of varying the dynamic opening, static openings, wall thickness, and inner-tube diameter was investigated. pressure-distribution measurements showing stem and tip effects were also made. a tentative design for a standard pitot-static tube for use in measuring air velocity is submitted. this report covers an investigation conducted under the auspices of the national research council.
