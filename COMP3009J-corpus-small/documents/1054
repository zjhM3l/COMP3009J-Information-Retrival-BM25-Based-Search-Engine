iterative solutions for the non-linear bending of circular plates. the authors study non-linear von karman equations for bending of a thin circular plate under uniform normal pressure. discussion is mainly concerned with plates clamped at the edges and with zero radial displacement, but analysis is valid for other edge conditions. solution is by an iterative procedure whose convergence properties are studied by means of integral equations. method is then applied to finite difference formulation of the differential equations in order to obtain numerical solutions. numerical results are compared with previous work by other authors and the advantages of the present method are indicated.
