transition in a separated laminar boundary layer. transition to turbulence was studied in a separated laminar boundary layer on a flat plate 24 in. long and thick. steps with a height of to were provided at a distance of 4 to transition was observed through a hot-wire anemometer. the author concludes that transition was always initiated by tollmien-schlichting waves. two types of transition were observed. in one type, bursts suddenly appeared in the wavy flow. the other type consists of amplification, distortion, and breaking up of the waves. which type of transition occurs depends on the value of the following parameter.. boundary-layer displacement thickness times step height times free-stream velocity squared divided by kinematic velocity squared. the burst type has been observed for values of this parameter larger than 4.2 x 10. the separated laminar boundary layer becomes unstable and develops waves when the critical reynolds number based on boundary-layer displacement thickness at the step location exceeds a value of 350. some conclusions on the development of separation bubbles on air foils are drawn from the present studies.
