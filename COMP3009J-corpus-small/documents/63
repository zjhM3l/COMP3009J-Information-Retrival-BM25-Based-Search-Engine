hypersonic viscous flow over slender cones. viscous self-induced pressures on 3 -semivertex-angle cones were measured over the range 3.7 free-stream mach number 5.8 and 0.5 viscous-interaction parameter 2.3. the data were found to be in good agreement with results obtained by talbot on 5 cones in the range rameter 3.5. all these data were correlated reasonably well by the viscous-interaction parameter, which is defined as where and are the mach number and reynolds number based on ideal taylor-maccoll flow conditions and c is the chapman-rubesin factor. a new method for calculating self-induced pressures is presented which takes into account the interaction between boundary-layer growth and the inviscid-flow field at the outer edge of the boundary layer. pressures calculated by this method were only 10 to 20 percent higher than the measured values.
