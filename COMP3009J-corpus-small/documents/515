self sustained oscillations of a system with non-linear damping of a particular type. the paper deals with self-sustained oscillations of a dynamic system of single degree of freedom, with linear restoring force and non-linear damping force. the latter is supposed to be a function of velocity representable by a simple /polygonal/ graph, such that the damping is negative at small velocities but becomes positive at velocities above a certain value. on these assumptions, a rigorous solution is presented, including the equations of motion, amplitude, maximum velocity and period. a very simple solution is obtained for the limiting case of vanishingly small damping. an approximate solution by series in powers of damping ratio is worked out which gives a satisfactory accuracy for quite large values of.
