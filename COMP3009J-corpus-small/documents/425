the solution of elastic plate problems by electrical analogies. a dynamic-analogy method for the solution of elastic plate problems is described in this paper. the electrical circuits developed here can be set-up and studied on an electric-analog computer. problems involving deflections under constant load, transient vibrations, or normal modes can be solved in this way. the method of applying boundary conditions to plates with irregular edges is given, together with a detailed description of the representation of the boundary conditions for a rectangular variable-thickness plate. solutions that have been obtained on the cal tech electric-analog computer are presented for the static deflections and normal modes of a rectangular cantilever plate.
