heat transfer by laminar flow to a rotating plate. an exact solution of the heat-transfer problem for the von karman example of the laminar flow of a viscous fluid over a rotating plate is given in dimensionless form and physically discussed. the solution is explicitly given for a constant temperature on the plate with viscous dissipation included. the numerical results are given for prandtl numbers from 0.5 to 10.
