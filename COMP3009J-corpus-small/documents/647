bending of a uniformly loaded rectangular plate with two adjacent edges and the others either simply supported or free. the distribution of deflection and bending moment in a uniformly loaded rectangular plate having two adjacent edges clamped and the others either simply supported or free, are obtained by a method of superposition. numerical values are given for square plates and, in one case, the results are compared with those obtained by another method.
