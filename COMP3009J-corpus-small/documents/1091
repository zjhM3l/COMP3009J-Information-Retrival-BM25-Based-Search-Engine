data from a static thrust investigation of a large scale general research vtol-stol model in ground effect. the model was tested at two different elevations with the wing pivot at 1.008 and 2.425 propeller diameters above the ground. the slipstream of the propellers was deflected by tilting the wing and propellers, by deflections of large-chord trailing-edge flaps, and by combinations of flap deflection and wing tilt. tests were conducted over a range of propeller disk loadings from 7.41 to 29.70 pounds per square foot. force data for the complete model and pressure distributions for the wing and flaps behind one propeller were recorded and are presented in tabular form without analysis.
