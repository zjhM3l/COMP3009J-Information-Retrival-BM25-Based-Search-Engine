study of effects of sweep on the flutter of cantilever wings. an experimental and analytical investigation of the flutter of sweptback cantilever wings is reported. the experiments employed groups of wings swept back by rotating and by shearing. the angle of sweep ranged from 0 to 60 and mach numbers extended to approximately 0.85. a theoretical analysis of the air forces on an oscillating swept wing of high length-chord ratio is developed, and the approximations inherent in the assumptions are discussed. comparison with experiment indicates that the analysis developed in the present report is satisfactory for giving the main effects of sweep, at least for nearly uniform cantilever wings of high and moderate length-chord ratios. a separation of the effects of finite span and compressibility in their relation to sweep has not been made experimentally but some combined effects are given. a discussion of some of the experimental and theoretical trends is given with the aid of several tables and figures.
