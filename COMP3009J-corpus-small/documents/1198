the blunt-leading-edge problem in hypersonic flow. the present paper is mainly concerned with the hypersonic flow over a flat plate with a blunt nose. the analysis is based on the flow model in which the flow field behind the shock wave may be divided into two regions.. the inviscid-hypersonic-flow region and the entropy layer, across which the pressure has no appreciable change. the equations for the entropy layer can be reduced to those of the usual boundary-layer problem with the exception that the outer edge of the entropy layer, as well as the pressure remain unknown. these unknowns are determined so as to approximately match the entropy-layer solution with the inviscid hypersonic solution in which the shock wave has the shape of the power law of the distance from the leading edge. the assumed flow model is shown to be valid over a restricted range depending on the wall-to-stagnation temperature ratio and (where is the reynolds number based on half the thickness of nose t, m the freestream mach number, and c the chapman-rubesin constant. actual calculations have been carried out for the case with typical values of and the wall-to-stagnation temperature ratio. the calculated values for both the surface pressure and heat-transfer rate are compared with the experimental data. as regards surface pressure in particular, a satisfactory agreement with the data is obtained. the validity of the assumptions upon which the present analysis is based has been examined from the numerical results, and the region of the validity has been found to extend over a certain large range of the nondimensional distance from the leading edge.
