influence coefficients for real gases. in the analysis of one-dimensional fluid-flow problems, it is often assumed that the behavior of the medium is that of a perfect gas. this assumption is justified, provided the pressure and temperature range of interest is small and near atmospheric. at higher pressures and temperatures various deviations are introduced thereby causing deviations from the results obtained by using the ideal fluid-flow equations. in this note, influence coefficients, similar to those developed by shapiro, are presented for the case of real gases. this analysis is based upon the use of various functions of the compressibility factor emmons. some of the assumptions made were as follows.. (1) the flow is one-dimensional and steady, (2) changes in the stream properties are continuous, and (3) the flow is comprised of imperfect gases
