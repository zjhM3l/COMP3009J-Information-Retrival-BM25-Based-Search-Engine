on the numerical solution of the blasius problem with three-point boundary conditions. relates to a technique for approximate determination of the initial parameters. the technique is an application of the asymptotic integration method introduced by meksyn and has been applied to the computation of the skin friction for shock-generated boundary-layer flow.
