bending and compression tests of pressurised ring-stiffened cylinders. the results of tests on pressurized ring-stiffened cylinders subjected to compression and bending are presented and discussed. the results obtained at high values of internal pressure differ from those obtained by previous investigators in that the theoretical small-deflection compressive buckling coefficient of 0.6 was nearly achieved in each test. small amounts of internal pressure had a greater stabilizing effect in the bending tests than in the compression tests.
