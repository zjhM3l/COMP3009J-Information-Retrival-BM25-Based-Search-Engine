local heat transfer to a yawed, infite, circular cylinder in laminar compressible flow. this note presents a simplification of a method for calculating the ratio of local to stagnation-line heat-transfer coefficients on a yawed, infinite, circular cylinder in laminar compressible flow. a brief description of the method of ref. 1 is presented, followed by a discussion of the assumptions and mathematical procedure which lead to a considerable simplification.
