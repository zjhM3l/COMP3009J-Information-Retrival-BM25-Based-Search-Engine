a closed-form solution for the oscillations of a vehicle entering a planetary atmosphere. author considers the equation of the yawing motion of a missile, derived with a series of customary assumptions and with the distance traveled as the independent variable. his assumptions include the linearity of the aerodynamic forces, the constancy of the aerodynamic coefficients with respect to mach number, the absence of spin, and the absence of gravity. if to these assumptions one could add the common ballistic assumption of a constant air density, the coefficients of this equation would have been con-damped sinusoids. in ballistics any slow variation of these coefstant, and the solution would have been simply the exponentially-ficients is usually treated by adding an approximate correction term to the damping rate (which is spoken of as the wkb perturbation). however, with a body entering the planetary atmosphere the variation of the air density is apparently of greater essence (this is a point not stated explicitly in this brief communication), and the equation is of the type. the author shows that with a series of further transformations the equation can be reduced to the form the solutions of which are confluent hypergeometric functions. these functions are defined as series involving gamma functions, and with a series of further assumptions can be reduced to laguerre polynomials and bessel functions. it is certainly nice to have an exact solution to a problem which has heretofore been extensively treated by approximations and by the numerical approach. this reviewer is puzzled, however, as to the practical significance of the proposed approach. an idealization is of value in that it facilitates our understanding,. and the numerical approach, in that it allows refinements of the problem, freeing us from the necessity of idealizing. but the proposed solution is certainly more difficult to refine than the original problem,. and it is certainly not simple (the solution of the original equation is not the value of z, but the various /reverse/ transformations of z). an evaluation of a series in practice must compete with the numerical approach,. and the equation suggested is of the zero). viewing the problem /afresh/ (in the light of the / computer revolution/ and without the constraints imposed by the prior art), it seems at least equally easy to /standardize/ the solutions of the original equation.
