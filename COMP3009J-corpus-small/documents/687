oscillating airfoils at high mach number. a simple formula is given for the pressure distribution on an oscillating airfoil in two-dimensional flow at high mach number. the formula is expected to be reasonably accurate if the pressure on the surface remains within the range 0.2 to 3.5 times the mainstream pressure. to illustrate the application of the formula, some results for symmetrical airfoils performing pitching oscillations are obtained and compared with results obtained from existing theories in the case of high mach number.
