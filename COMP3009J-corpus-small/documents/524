stagnation point heat transfer in partially ionized air. comparison of heat-transfer rates, obtained by using transport properties recently reported by peng and pindroh, with rates based on hansen's thermodynamic and transport properties. it is shown that the heat-transfer rates based on the peng and pindroh data are 20 to 30 lower for the velocity range of 25,000 to 40,000 ft sec.
