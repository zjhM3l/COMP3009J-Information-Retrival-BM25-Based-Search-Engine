hypersonic flight and the re-entry problem. paper reviews the possibilities and some of the main problems of three types of long-range vehicle, the ballistic, the glide, and the skip rocket. performance assessments are made on the basis of an ingenious, if debatable, conversion of the vehicle characteristics to the breguet formula. the problems of aerodynamic heating, aerodynamic loads and stability are briefly discussed, and other aspects of hypersonic flight free molecule flow-dash are touched upon. the results on the whole favor the glide vehicle for manned flight. the subsequent discussion on the paper includes references to multistaging and the use of high-energy fuels.
