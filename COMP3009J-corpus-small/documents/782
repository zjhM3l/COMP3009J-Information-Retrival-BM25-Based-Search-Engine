calculated subsonic span loads and resulting stability derivatives of unswept and 45degree sweptback tail surfaces in sideslip and steady roll. subsonic span loads and the resulting stability derivatives have been calculated for a systematic series of vertical- and horizontal-tail combinations in sideslip and in steady roll in order to provide information embracing a wide range of probable tail configurations. all calculations were made by application of the discrete-horseshoe-vortex method to the problem of estimating loads on intersecting surfaces. the investigation covered variations in vertical-tail aspect ratio, the ratio of horizontal-tail aspect ratio to vertical-tail aspect ratio, the effects of horizontal-tail dihedral angle /for the sideslip case/, and the effects of vertical position of the horizontal tail for surfaces having their quarter-chord lines swept back 0degrees and 45degrees. the results of the investigation are presented in charts from which the span loads for the various conditions can be obtained. the resulting stability derivatives are presented as vertical- and horizontal-tail contributions as well as total-tail-assembly derivatives. the results of this investigation, which was made for a wider range of geometric variables than previous studies, showed trends which were in general agreement with the results of previous investigations. also presented in this paper and used in the computations is an extensive table of values of sidewash due to a rectangular vortex.
