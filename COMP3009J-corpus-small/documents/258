the effect of turbulence on slider bearing lubrication. based on prandtl's mixing-length mechanism, the pressure equation for turbulent flow in slider-bearing lubrication is derived. an analytical solution is given and compared with the one for laminar flow. it is found that the turbulent effect increases the pressure and consequently, the load-carrying capacity. however, the power loss also increases.
