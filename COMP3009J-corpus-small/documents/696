pressure loads produced on a flat-plate wing by rocket jets exhausting in a spanwise direction below the wing and perpendicular to a free-stream flow of mach number 2.0. an investigation at a reynolds number per foot of 14.4 x 10 was made to determine the pressure loads produced on a flat-plate wing by rocket jets exhausting in a spanwise direction beneath the wing and perpendicular to a free-stream flow of mach number 2.0. the ranges of the variables involved were /1/ nozzle types - one sonic /jet mach number of two-dimensional supersonic /jet mach number of 1.71/,. /2/ vertical nozzle positions beneath the wing of 4, 8, and 12 nozzle-throat diameters,. and /3/ ratios of rocket-chamber total pressure to free-stream static pressure from 0 to 130. the incremental normal force due to jet interference on the wing varied from one to two times the rocket thrust and generally decreased as the pressure ratio increased. the chordwise coordinate of the incremental-normal-force center of pressure remained upstream of the nozzle center line for the nozzle positions and pressure ratios of the investigation. the chordwise coordinate approached zero as the jet vertical distance beneath the wing increased. in the spanwise direction there was little change due to varying rocket-jet position and pressure ratio. some boundary-layer flow separation on the wing was observed for the rocket jets close to the wing and at the higher pressure ratios. the magnitude of the chordwise and spanwise pressure distributions due to jet interference was greatest for rocket jets close to the wing and decreased as the jet was displaced farther from the wing. the design procedure for the rockets used is given in the appendix.
