on the bending of circular cylindrical shells under pure bending. the stability of circular cylindrical shells under pure bending is investigated by means of batdorf's modified donnell's equation and the galerkin method. the results of this investigation have shown that, contrary to the commonly accepted value, the maximum critical bending stress is for all practical purposes equal to the critical compressive stress.
