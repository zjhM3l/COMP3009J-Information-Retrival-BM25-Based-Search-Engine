exploratory investigation of the effect of a forward facing jet on the bow shock of a blunt body in a mach number 6 free stream. the effect of a forward-facing jet on the bow shock of a blunt body in a mach 6 free stream was investigated experimentally. the models tested had forward-facing jets using air and helium exhausting at mach numbers from 1 to 10.3 and were run through a range of the ratio of jet total pressure to free-stream total pressure of 0.03 (jet off) to 2.5. the ratio of body diameter to jet-exit diameter varied from 1.12 to 55.6 and the angle of attack was varied from 0 to 35. the experimental results show that the main-stream shock can be affected by the jet in two significantly different ways. one way is simply to move the strong shock away from the body without altering its shape. the second and perhaps more interesting case occurs when the jet causes a large displacement of the main shock and considerably changes its shape. it was found that the ratio of jet total pressure to free-stream total pressure necessary to obtain the large displacements of the main-stream shock depended on the ratio of body diameter to jet-exit diameter and also on the jet-exit mach number. the maximum amount the shock could be displaced in percent of body diameter was seen to increase with increasing jet-exit mach number and also with decreasing ratio of body diameter to jet-exit diameter. for the models that were investigated through an angle-of-attack range, the displacement became very unsteady and fell off sharply as the angle of attack was increased. simplified theoretical considerations applied to the shock-displacement phenomena provide a possible explanation for the two different types of main-stream shock displacement. theoretical curves show the regions where these types of displacement would occur for different exit mach numbers and pressure ratios for a forward-facing jet in a mach 6 stream.
