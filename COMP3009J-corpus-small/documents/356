on optimum nose curves for missiles in the super-aerodynamic regime. author shows that the differential equations defining the minimum drag body shapes for free molecule flow that were developed and numerically integrated by w. j. carter (amr 11 (1958), rev. realized, however, that numerical or analytical integration of the second-order differential equation is unnecessary since, for the flow conditions considered, the first integral to the euler equation can be written prior to the substitution of the expression defining the pressure coefficient.
