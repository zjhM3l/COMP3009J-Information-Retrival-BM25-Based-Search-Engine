boundary layers with suction and injection. a review of published work on skin friction. available data on the effects of suction and injection on skin friction are summarised and compared. it is shown that injection into a turbulent boundary layer can produce a skin friction coefficient lower than the laminar value at the same reynolds number on an impermeable plate.
