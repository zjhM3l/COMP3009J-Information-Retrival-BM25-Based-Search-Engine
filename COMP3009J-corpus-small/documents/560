a theoretical study of the effect of upstream transpiration-cooling on the heat transfer and skin friction characteristics of a compressible laminar boundary layer. an analysis is presented which predicts the skin-friction and heat-transfer characteristics of a compressible, laminar boundary layer on a solid flat plate preceded by a porous section that is transpiration cooled. the analysis is restricted to a prandtl number of unity and linear variation of viscosity with temperature. the local skin friction has been found to have a low value in the region of transpiration cooling and then to increase until it approaches the value for a completely nonporous surface asymptotically. the initial increase in local skin friction is rapid as half of the ultimate increase occurs in a distance beyond the porous region that is about 20 percent of the length of the porous region for all rates of injection. when the total coolant flow rate is kept constant and the porous length is varied, it is found that the average skin friction on a partially porous plate is slightly lower than that on a fully porous plate. the local heat transfer behaves in a manner similar to that of the local skin friction. it is found, in an example, that the temperature at the end of a partially porous plate could be maintained at about the same temperature as a fully porous plate by doubling the total rate of coolant flow.
