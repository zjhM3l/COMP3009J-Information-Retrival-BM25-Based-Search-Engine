fundamentals of boundary layer heat transfer with streamwise temperature variations. boundary-layer heat transfer is analyzed for the case of a sinusoidal distribution of temperature in the direction of flow. it is shown that for both laminar and turbulent flow the spatial distribution of heat transfer is generally out of phase with the wall temperature by an angle of 30 to 45. this leads to the conclusion that in some areas the heat flow is opposite to the temperature difference as used in the definition of the heat-transfer coefficient, and points to the basic shortcomings of this concept. the physical explanation for this behavior is found to be the temperature-field distortion by the fluid motion. the distortion is measured by the peclet number. approximate equations representing a /conduction analogy/ were used in this analysis and the validity of these equations for unsteady flow is examined with reference to limitations in frequency and wavelength. a solution of these equations is given for the case of a velocity profile which is not a straight line. the use of previously developed variational principles for the evaluation of convective heat transfer including cases of three-dimensional unsteady flow, turbulence, and nonparallel streamlines is also discussed.
