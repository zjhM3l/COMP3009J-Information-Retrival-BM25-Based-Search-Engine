transition reynolds numbers of separated flows at supersonic speeds. experimental research has been conducted on the effects of wall cooling, mach number, and unit reynolds number on the transition reynolds number of cylindrical separated boundary layers on an ogive-cylinder model. results were obtained from pressure and temperature measurements and shadowgraph observations. the maximum scope of measurements encompassed mach numbers between 2.06 and 4.24, reynolds numbers (based on length of separation) between 60,000 and 400,000, and ratios of wall temperature to adiabatic wall temperature between 0.35 and 1.0. within the range of the present tests, the transition reynolds number was observed to decrease with increasing wall cooling, increase with increasing mach number, and increase with increasing unit reynolds number. the wall-cooling effect was found to be four times as great when the attached boundary layer upstream of separation was cooled in conjunction with cooling of the separated boundary layer as when only the separated boundary layer was cooled. wall cooling of both the attached and separated flow regions also caused, in some cases, reattachment in the otherwise separated region. cavity resonance present in the separated region for some model configurations was accompanied by a large decrease in transition reynolds number at the lower test mach numbers.
