experimental study of the random vibrations of an aircraft structure excited by jet noise. recordings have been made of the strains induced in a full scale rear fuselage test structure of the caravelle air-liner when one jet engine is running at maximum take-off thrust. the analysis has been concentrated on the strains in the centres of panels. correlation measurements indicate that the larger panel strains occur above resonance peak in each panel has been identified with the fundamental stringer-twisting mode but the mode-shapes for the two smaller peaks have not been completely determined. an attempt has been made to calculate the panel resonant frequencies theoretically.
