boundary layer behind shock or thin expansion wave moving into stationary fluid. the boundary layer behind a shock or thin expansion wave advancing into a stationary fluid has been determined. laminar and turbulent boundary layers were considered. the wall surface temperature behind the wave was also investigated. the assumption of a thin expansion wave is valid for weak expansions but becomes progressively less accurate for strong expansion waves. the laminar-boundary-layer problem was solved by numerical integration except for the weak wave case, which can be solved analytically. integral (karman-pohlhausen type) solutions were also obtained to provide a guide for determining expressions which accurately represent the numerical data. analytical expressions for various boundary-layer parameters are presented which agree with the numerical integrations within 1 percent. the turbulent-boundary-layer problem was solved using integral methods similar to those employed for the solution of turbulent compressible flow over a semi-infinite flat plate. the fluid velocity, relative to the wall, was assumed to have a seventh-power profile. the blasius equation, relating turbulent skin friction and boundary-layer thickness, was utilized in a form which accounted for compressibility. consideration of the heat transfer to the wall permitted the wall surface temperature, behind the wave, to be determined. the wall thickness was assumed to be greater than the wall thermal-boundary-layer thickness. it was found that the wall temperature was uniform (as a function of distance behind the wave) for the laminar-boundary-layer case but varied with distance for the turbulent-boundary-layer case.
