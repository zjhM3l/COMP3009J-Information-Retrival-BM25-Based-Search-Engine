aerodynamic characteristics of propeller-driven vtol aircraft. this paper discusses the two major configurations that are usually considered for achieving vtol while keeping the fuselage essentially horizontal - that is, the tilt-wing and the deflected-slipstream configurations. because of the high turning losses incurred by deflected-slipstream configurations in hovering and because of the wing-stalling problem of the pure tilt-wing configurations during the transition, it appears that a combination of the two principles should be used. this tilt-wing and flap configuration should make use of a programed extensible-chord slotted flap together with a leading-edge high-lift device in order to avoid the performance and handling qualities problems associated with wing stalling during the transition while keeping the wing area as low as possible for efficiency in cruising flight.
