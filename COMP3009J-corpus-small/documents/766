experimental investigation at mach number of 3. 0 of effects of thermal stress and buckling on flutter characteristics of flat single-bay panels of length-width ratio 0. 96. flat, single-bay, skin stiffener panels with length-width ratios of 0.96 were tested at a mach number of 3.0, at dynamic pressures ranging from 1,500 to stagnation temperatures from 300 f to effects of thermal stress and buckling on the flutter of such panels. the panel supporting structure allowed partial thermal expansion of the skins in both the longitudinal and lateral directions. panel skin material and skin thickness were varied. a boundary faired through the experimental flutter points consisted of a flat-panel portion, a buckled-panel portion, and a transition point, at the intersection of the two boundaries, where a panel is most susceptible to flutter. the flutter region consisted of two fairly distinct sections, a large-amplitude flutter region and a small-amplitude flutter region. the results show that an increase in panel skin temperature flutter. the flutter trend for buckled panels is reversed. use of a modified temperature parameter, which approximately accounts for the effects of differential pressure and variations in panel skin material and skin thickness, reduced the scatter in the data which resulted when these effects were neglected. the results are compared with an exact theory for clamped panels for the condition of zero midplane stress. in addition, a two-mode /transtability/ solution for clamped panels is compared with the experimentally determined transition point.
