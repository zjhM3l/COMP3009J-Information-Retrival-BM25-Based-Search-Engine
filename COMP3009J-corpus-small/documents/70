a study of flow changes associated with airfoil section drag rise at supercritical speeds. a study of experimental pressure distributions and section characteristics for several moderately thick airfoil sections was made. a correlation appears to exist between the drag-divergence mach number and the free-stream mach number for which sonic velocity occurs at the airfoil crest, the chordwise station at which the airfoil surface is tangent to the free-stream direction. it was found that, since the mach number for which sonic velocity occurs at the airfoil crest can be estimated satisfactorily by means of the prandtl-glauert rule, a method is provided whereby the drag-divergence mach number of an airfoil section at a given angle of attack can be estimated from the low-speed pressure distribution and the airfoil profile. this method was used to predict with a reasonable degree of accuracy the drag-divergence mach number of a considerable number of airfoil sections having diverse shapes and a wide range of thickness-chord ratios. the pressure distributions and section force characteristics of several moderately thick airfoil sections at mach numbers above the drag-divergence mach number were analyzed. some of the characteristics of the flow over these airfoils at supercritical mach numbers are discussed.
