approximate analytical solutions for hypersonic flow past slender power-law bodies. approximate analytical solutions are presented for two-dimensional and axisymmetric hypersonic flow over blunt-nosed slender bodies whose shapes follow a power law variation. in particular, the body shape is given by where is the transverse body ordinate, is the streamwise distance from the nose, and m is a constant in the range. both zero-order solutions and first-order (small but nonvanishing values of solutions are presented, where m is the free-stream mach number and is a characteristic body or streamline slope. the zero-order shock shape is similar to the body shape for these flows. the solutions are found within the framework of hypersonic-slender-body theory. the limiting case m=1 corresponds to a wedge or cone flow. the limiting case corresponds to a constant-energy flow. the latter cases are included so that the present study may be applied to all flows wherein the zero-order shock shape is given by with m in the range. flow fields associated with shock shapes having values of m outside this range are also discussed. for all values of, except m=1, certain portions of the flow field riolate the hypersonic-slender-body approximations, while other portions are consistent with these approximations. for m=1, all portions of the flow field are consistent with the approximations. the approximate solutions are found as follows. the asymptotic form of the flow in the vicinity of the body surface is used as a guide to write approximate expressions for the dependent variables. these expressions exactly satisfy the continuity and energy equations and contain arbitrary constants which are evaluated so as to satisfy boundary conditions at the shock. the approximate solutions do not satisfy the lateral momentum equation except at the shock and (for the first-order problem) at the body surface. the results of the approximate solutions are compared with numerical integrations of the equations of motion for various values of m and (ratio of specific heats). good agreement is noted, particularly when m and are both near one. the shock is relatively close to the body for the latter cases. sufficient results are presented to evaluate the accuracy of the approximate method for various values of m and.
