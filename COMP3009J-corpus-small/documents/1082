the flow past pitot tube at low reynolds numbers, part 1-dash the numerical solution of the navier-stokes equations for steady viscous axisymmetric flow, part 2-dash the effects of viscosity and orifice size on a pitot tube at low reynolds numbers. in this report numerical methods used to solve the navier-stokes equations for steady viscous two-dimensional flow are extended to include the case of axial symmetry. the equations and their finite difference approximations are derived working in cylindrical polar co-ordinates with the stokes' stream function and the vorticity as variables. a new method of dealing with the boundary conditions is given. the effects of viscosity and orlfice size on a blunt-nosed pitot tube have been theoretically investigated up to a reynolds number of ten, where the reynolds number has been based on the radius of the tube. results are expressed in terms of a pressure coefficient where p is the pressure measured in the tube, p the density of the fluid, and p and u the static pressure and velocity in an undisturbed flow at the position of the tube. the values of c for a blunt-nosed tube are found to be less than those for tubes with hemispheroidal heads, but always greater than unity in the range considered. the effect of the orifice size is to decrease c as the orifice size increases, this decrease is very small but increases with the reynolds number. at a reynolds number of ten the decrease is at most five per cent of the value of c when there is no orifice. it is suggested that the decrease of c below unity found in some experimental investigations at a higher reynolds number could be due to the effects of orifice size.
