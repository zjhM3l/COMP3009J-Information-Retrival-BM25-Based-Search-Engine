an improved smoke generator for use in the visualisation of airflow, particularly boundary layer flow at high reynolds numbers. and rapid method by which boundary layer flow was rendered visible has been previously described in the journal of the royal aeronautical society. it gave promise of being useful at the highest tunnel speeds provided a denser smoke could be obtained, which at the same time was free from the troublesome deposits associated with the wood smoke. of the aerodynamics division attempts were made by the fuel research station to improve the density of the wood smoke and to reduce the deposits. these they showed were conflicting requirements, and whilst some improvement was effected, it was not sufficient for observation in the new tunnels at high speeds. the staff of the director-general of scientific research and development, ministry of supply, was then approached and it was decided to develop an oil smoke generator from a simple generator of this type which was demonstrated to us. this has been done successfully. the final apparatus in contrast to the wood smoke generator is light and compact. it takes only a few minutes to start and can be run as long as desired. improvement on the wood smoke both as regards density and freedom from deposits, which cause premature transition. the density and quality of the smoke are now under control. smokes ranging from a light smoke of bluish white colour to a heavy smoke dense white in appearance can be obtained. the oil smoke retains the advantages of the wood smoke in that it is non-corrosive and non-irritant, and the smell can be tolerated even when it is present in a considerable concentration. a certain amount of condensation is inevitable with oil smokes, but with suitable precautions troubles arising from this can be avoided. a dry solid smoke made by melting a hard wax was successfully generated with the same apparatus. unfortunately because of its flocculent nature this smoke gave rise to solid deposits when passed through bore tubing, leading eventually to complete blockage. this seems to be a feature of solid smokes. the apparatus has been used to determine transition and laminar separation points on model wings in a number of the national physical laboratory tunnels. smoke filaments have been maintained in the laminar state up to wind speeds of 180 ft. sec. in the new tunnels. there is much to be said for making a standard practice of visualising boundary layer flow on models, particularly as the technique is simple and rapid. it would greatly assist the interpretation of force measurements and the more detailed explorations of the boundary layer by total head tubes and hot wires. the use of oil smoke is not limited to boundary layer flow visualisation. the apparatus described in this report would seem to be particularly suited for educational work in small demonstration tunnels.
