heat transfer to bodies traveling at high speed in the upper atmosphere. a general method has been developed, using the methods of kinetic theory, whereby the surface temperatures of bodies can be calculated for steady flight at any speed in a rarefied gas. the particular solution was made for a flat plate., however, the calculations can be easily extended to bodies of arbitrary shape. it was found that the aerodynamic heating problem in the absence of solar radiation, that is, for the case of nocturnal flight, becomes of negligible importance at altitudes of 125 miles and higher and up to steady flight speeds of 36,000 feet per second. the effect of solar radiation, for the case of daytime flight, becomes increasingly important as the flight altitude is increased. at an altitude of 150 miles and higher, solar radiation is the predominating factor that determines skin temperature. owing to the strong effect of solar radiation on skin temperatures at high altitudes, the desirability of nocturnal flight is indicated in order to minimize skin temperatures. in order to maintain low skin temperatures, it was found that the angle of inclination of the body with respect to the flight path should be kept as small as possible. this may be accomplished in practice by designing the body to be finely tapered and by flying the body at small angles of attack. it is pointed out that skin temperatures may be reduced by insuring thermal contact between portions of the skin inclined at positive and negative angles with respect to the flight path. as much surface as possible should be inclined at negative angles. practically, this may be accomplished by boattailing the body. in the event that an internal skin-cooling system is employed, it is shown that the rate of internal cooling must be of the same order of magnitude or greater than the rate at which heat is lost naturally by emitted radiation. if the cooling rate is below the natural radiation rate, cooling has little effect upon skin temperatures. it is shown that, in the case of a missile designed to fly over a wide range of altitudes and speeds, it is desirable to make the emissivity of the skin as high as possible. this conclusion, however, is based upon a skin surface for which the emissivity is independent of the wave length of the emitted and absorbed radiant energy. a possible method of reducing surface temperatures is indicated by the decrease in skin temperature which accompanies a decrease in thermal accommodation coefficient. this phenomenon may be used to advantage if it is possible to decrease the accommodation coefficient by altering the surface characteristics of the skin.
