consideration of energy separation for laminar slip flow in a circular tube. the energy separation for laminar low-density-nonunity prandtl number flow in circular cross-section tubes is the topic of this note. a conclusion is reached as to the effect of prandtl number on the velocity profiles for these flows. however, in order to reach valid quantitative conclusions the reviewer feels that more detailed analysis is in order, and that the analysis as presented here is of qualitative value only.
