properties of the confluent hypergeometric function. the confluent hypergeometric functions have proved useful in many branches of physics. they have been used in such problems involving diffusion and sedimentation, as isotope separation and protein molecular weight determinations in the ultracentrifuge. the solution of the equation for the velocity distribution of electrons in high frequency gas discharges may frequently be expressed in terms of these functions. the high frequency breakdown electric field may then be predicted theoretically for gases by the use of such solutions together with kinetic theory. this report presents some of the properties of the confluent hypergeometric functions together with six-figure tables of the functions.
