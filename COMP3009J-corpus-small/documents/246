the design of minimum drag tip fins. with an appendix - on the conformal transformation of a wing with a fin. the report describes an investigation into the design of minimum drag tip fins by lifting line theory. the work is based on an exact solution of the conformal transformation which is applicable to this problem following the method of trefitz. three types of solution are treated, corresponding to symmetrical upper and lower fins, single upper or lower fins, and unequal upper and lower fins. a representative range of solutions for circulation distribution along wing and fins has been calculated for each of the three cases by the use of elliptic and theta functions. a detailed account is given, with examples, of the procedure for calculating the plan of wing and fins, the lift and induced drag, and the setting of the fins.
