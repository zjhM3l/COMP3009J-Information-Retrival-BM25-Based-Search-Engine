a compressor routine test code. the routine testing of aircraft-type compressors.dash in the main, axial-flow, multi-stage compressors.dash requires a compromise between research accuracy and the practical considerations. this test code is the outcome of a survey of compressor testing techniques and instrumentation, initiated and subsequently discussed and endorsed by the aerodynamics sub-committee of the gas turbine collaboration committee. the code aims at defining methods of measurement and weighting whereby compressor performance can be obtained sufficiently accurately for a realistic and direct comparison to be made between one compressor and another. the measurement of a quantity at a point in the fluid flow, and the averaging and weighting of such measurements have been treated separately as far as is possible. the recommendations are given in the main text, whilst additional discussion on these is put into the appendices.
