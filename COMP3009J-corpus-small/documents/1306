experiments on circular cones at yaw in supersonic flow. pressure measurements made in the fort halstead supersonic tunnel on two circular cones, of semiapex angles 15 and coefficients are compared with corresponding values calculated by theoretical methods, and the relative merits of these methods are then discussed.
