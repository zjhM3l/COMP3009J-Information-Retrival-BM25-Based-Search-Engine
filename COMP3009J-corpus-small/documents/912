the axisymmetric free-convection temperature field along a vertical thin cylinder. with a view to studying the effect of strong transverse curvature on boundary-layer problems, the axisymmetric free- convection problem along a vertical thin cylinder is investigated theoretically as well as experimentally. a theory is developed as an extension of the pohlhausen solution of a thick axisymmetric laminar boundary layer by mark and by glauert and lighthill. experiments consist of a thermocouple survey of the temperature field over an electrically-heated brass cylinder of diameter and 10 ft. height and an interferometric study of the density field over a bare tungsten wire of 0.02-in. diameter and 5 ft. height. the thermal-layer thicknesses are about five and fifty times the radii of the cylinders, respectively. experimental results of the local heat-transfer coefficient are in excellent agreement with the theory. this, in turn, justifies the theories of laminar boundary layer along a thin cylinder, at least indirectly.
