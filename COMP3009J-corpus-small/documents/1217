application of inequality constraints to variational problems of lifting re-entry. inequality constraints are introduced into the variational formulation of the optimum re-entry problem for a lifting vehicle to prevent human and or structural tolerances from being exceeded. these constraints consist of minimum and maximum angle of attack, maximum load factor, and maximum convective heat transfer (equilibrium temperature). the equations have been programed for the ibm 704 computer, and sample trajectories are presented for which the total heat transferred to certain critical areas on the windward surface of the vehicle is minimized. these trajectories indicate the dominant effect of the constraints on the optimum flight path, which is shown to consist of both unconstrained and constrained arcs.
