investigation of a systematic group of naca 1 - series cowlings with and without spinners. an investigation has been conducted in the langley propeller-research tunnel to study cowling-spinner combinations based on the naca 1-series nose inlets and to obtain systematic design data for one family of approximately ellipsoidal spinners. in the main part of the investigation, 11 of the related spinners were tested in various combinations with 9 naca open-nose cowlings, which were also tested without spinners. the effects of location and shape of the spinner, shape of the inner surface of the cowling lip, and operation of a propeller having approximately oval shanks were investigated briefly. in addition, a study was conducted to determine the correct procedure for extrapolating design conditions determined from the low-speed test data to the design conditions at the actual flight mach number. the design conditions for the naca 1-series cowlings and cowling-spinner combinations are presented in the form of charts from which, for wide ranges of spinner proportions and rates of internal flow, cowlings with near-maximum pressure recovery can be selected for critical mach numbers ranging from spinners and the effects of the spinners and the propeller on the cowling design conditions are presented separately to provide initial quantitative data for use in a general design procedure through which naca 1-series cowlings can be selected for use with spinners of other shapes. by use of this general design procedure, correlation curves established from the test data, and derived compressible-flow equations relating the inlet-velocity ratio to the surface pressures on the cowling and spinner, naca 1-series cowlings and cowling-spinner combinations can be designed for critical mach numbers as high as 0.90.
