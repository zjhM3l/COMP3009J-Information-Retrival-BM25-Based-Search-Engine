some effects of variations in several parameters including fluid density on the flutter speed of light uniform cantilever wings. an experimental investigation has been made of some effects of variations in several parameters, including fluid density, on the flutter characteristics of light uniform cantilever wings. the assortment of wings tested covered a variety of positions of the elastic axis and center of gravity and values of the aspect ratio of 8, 6, and 4. the relative-density parameter (where k is representative of the ratio of fluid density to wing mass) was varied over a range of values from 1.2 to nearly 14. special emphasis has been placed on the lower values. the experimental investigation has been supplemented by an analytical investigation based on the two-dimensional aerodynamic theory for incompressible flow. in a few instances corrections for the effects of finite span have been made. in general, the theoretical results followed the trends indicated by experiment except at very low values of the relative-density parameter. for these low values the analytical considerations employed indicated a freedom from flutter not found experimentally. at higher values of the flutter-speed coefficient is shown to decrease with decreasing values of and to be nearly proportional to the inverse of the square root of the air density.
