on heat transfer over a sweat-cooled surface in laminar compressible flow with a pressure gradient. a simple expression is derived for the normal injection velocity distribution theoretically required to maintain a given uniform temperature along a porous surface in the laminar boundary-layer region of a compressible flow with a given velocity distribution outside of the boundary layer. this expression is valid for any given free-stream mach number but is based on a prandtl number of unity and on the assumption that the viscosity coefficient varies linearly with the temperature. by using the dorodnitsyn type of transformation, the variation of fluid properties even in the case of zero mach number is taken into account. this study is of particular practical interest in connection with the sweat-cooling of turbine blades and of airfoil surfaces in high speed flow. the method of analysis consists of applying the karman-pohlhausen method to both the momentum and energy boundary-layer equations and of using an additional heat balance equation, involving the coolant temperature. a closed-form approximate solution of the equations is then derived. numerical examples for flow in the immediate vicinity of a stagnation point and for a typical type of flow over a turbine blade are given.
