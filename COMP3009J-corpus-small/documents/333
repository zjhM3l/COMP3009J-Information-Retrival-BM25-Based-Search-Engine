boundary-layer interaction on a yawed infinite wing in hypersonic flow. the equations are given for the laminar boundary-layer equations on a yawed infinite wing for constant wall temperature, under the combined howorth and mangler transformation. diagrams show the relatively small influence of yaw, the increase of boundary-layer secondary flow, and the variation of the local heat transfer rate with yaw.
