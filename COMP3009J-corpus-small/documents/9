transition studies and skin friction measurements on an insulated flat plate at a mach number of 5.8. an investigation of transition and skin friction on an insulated flat plate, 5 by 26 in., was made in the galcit 5 by 5 in. hypersonic wind tunnel at a nominal mach number of 5.8. the phosphorescent lacquer technique was used for transition detection and was found to be in good agreement with total-head rake measurements along the plate surface and pitot boundary- layer surveys. it was found that the boundary layer was laminar at reynolds numbers of at least 5 x 10. transverse contamination caused by the turbulent boundary layer on the tunnel sidewall originated far downstream of the flat plate leading edge at reynolds numbers of 1.5 to 2 x 10, and spread at a uniform angle of 5 compared to 9 degree in low-speed flow. the effect of two-dimensional and local disturbances was investigated. the technique of air injection into the boundary layer as a means of hastening transition was extensively used. although the onset of transition occurred at reynolds numbers as low as 10, a fully developed turbulent boundary layer was not obtained at reynolds numbers much below 2 x 10 regardless of the amount of air injected. a qualitative discussion of these results is given with emphasis on the possibility of a greater stability of the laminar boundary layer in hypersonic flow than at lower speeds. direct skin-friction measurements were made by means of the floating element technique, over a range of reynolds numbers verified as being laminar over the complete range. with air injection, turbulent shear was obtained only for reynolds numbers greater than 2 x 10, this value being in good agreement with earlier results of this investigation. the turbulent skin-friction coefficient was found to be approximately 0.40 of that for incompressible flow for a constant value of r, and 0.46 for an effective reynolds number between 5 and 6 x 10.
