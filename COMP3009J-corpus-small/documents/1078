the steady flow of a viscous fluid past a circular cylinder at reynolds numbers 40 and 44. this paper describes the numerical solution of the complete navier-stokes equations for the steady flow of an incompressible viscous fluid of unlimited extent past a circular cylinder at reynolds number 40. a new device developed for the numerical solution is described. the results of the investigation are.. good agreement with experimental results. higher reynolds numbers even though they may not exist in nature. a solution has been obtained at reynolds number 44 but it has not been carried to the same accuracy as the solution at reynolds number 40. portion of the cylinder continues to increase with reynolds number in such steady-state solutions up to a reynolds number 44 and no indication has been found that this process will not continue as the reynolds number is increased beyond 44.
