static longitudinal stability characteristics of a blunted glider re-entry configuration having 79.5degree sweepback and 45degree dihedral at a mach number of 6.2 and angles of attack up to 20degree. an experimental investigation was conducted at a mach number of 6.2 to determine the static longitudinal stability characteristics of a model of a blunted glider reentry configuration having 79.5degree sweepback and 45degree dihedral. the free-stream reynolds number for the investigation was 3.0 x 10 based on the basic model length of 7.5 inches. tests were made through an angle-of-attack range from 0degrees to investigation showed that incorporating 10degree nose incidence in the basic model resulted in a lower lift-curve slope, a lower lift-drag ratio, a higher value of trim lift coefficient, and a decrease in static longitudinal stability. in comparison, the effect of extending the configuration length and incorporating 10degrees and 20degrees boattail angles resulted in smaller changes in the longitudinal stability characteristics of the model.
