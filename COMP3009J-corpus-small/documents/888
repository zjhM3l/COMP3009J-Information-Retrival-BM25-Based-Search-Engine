combinations of temperature and axial compression required for buckling of a ring-stiffened cylinder. a theory is presented to predict the buckling temperature of an axially compressed, uniformly heated ring-stiffened cylinder. the cylinder buckles because of the interaction of the axial stress due to applied compressive loads and the circumferential stress resulting from restraint of thermal expansion by the rings. buckling charts covering a wide range of cylinder proportions are presented for both clamped and simply supported cylinders. the buckling temperature for a given axial loading is determined from a simple equation involving a coefficient given in the buckling charts and the radius-thickness ratio of the cylinder.
