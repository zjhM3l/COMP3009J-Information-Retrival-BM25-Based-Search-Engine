motion of thin bodies in a highly rarefied plasma. magnetic effects are considered negligible, and the velocity of the body is in a range between the electron and positive ion thermal speeds. the self-consistent field approach is used in which the electron distribution is assumed to be maxwellian, while the positive ion distribution function is given by the /collision-free/ boltzmann equation. it is assumed that the ion reflection at the body surface is specular, and the body is sufficiently thin so that the ion distribution function is a small perturbation of a maxwellian distribution. the solution for the simple case of a dielectric body with a given surface charge, as well as some general properties to be expected for a conducting body are given.
