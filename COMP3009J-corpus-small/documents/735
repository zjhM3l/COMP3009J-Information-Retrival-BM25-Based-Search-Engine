the bending of uniformly loaded sectorial plates with clamped edges. this paper analyzes the bending of a sectorial plate, clamped on all edges and subjected to uniformly distributed load, by using two different methods of superposition on the elementary solution for a uniformly loaded circular plate with a clamped edge.
