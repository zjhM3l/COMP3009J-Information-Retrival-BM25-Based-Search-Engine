an investigation of some aspects of the sonic boom by means of wind tunnel measurements of pressures about several bodies at a mach number of 2. 01. an investigation of some aspects of the sonic boom has been made with the aid of wind-tunnel measurements of the pressure distributions about bodies of various shapes. the tests were made in the langley at a mach number of 2.01 and at a reynolds number per foot of 2.5 x 10. measurements of the pressure field were made at orifices in the surface of a boundary-layer bypass plate. the models which represented both fuselage and wing types of thickness distributions were small enough to allow measurements as far away as 8 body lengths or 64 chords. the results are compared with estimates made using existing theory. to the first order, the boom-producing pressure rise across the bow shock is dependent on the longitudinal development of body area and not on local details. nonaxisymmetrical shapes may be replaced by equivalent bodies of revolution to obtain satisfactory theoretical estimates of the far-field pressures.
