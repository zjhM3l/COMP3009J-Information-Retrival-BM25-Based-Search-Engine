on the application of mathieu functions in the theory of subsonic compressible flow past oscillating airfoils. an account is given of explicit solutions in terms of mathieu function functions of the problem of two-dimensional subsonic compressible flow past oscillating airfoils. the results are applied to the calculation of three-dimensional corrections for the two-dimensional theory and the effect of the incorporation of the three-dimensional effects on the mathieu function solution of the two-dimensional problem is shown. the developments are formal and must be supplemented by an appreciable amount of numerical calculations before the theory can be applied to specific problems.
