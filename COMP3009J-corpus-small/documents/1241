the turbulent boundary layer on chemically active ablating surfaces. incompressible turbulent-boundary-layer analysis is extrapolated analytically to the case of a compressible turbulent boundary layer with ablation or mass injection at the surface. the effects of chemical reactions such as dissociation and recombination as well as combustion are included. the analysis applies to blunt as well as sharp bodies which are either axisymmetric or two-dimensional. when the turbulent lewis and prandtl numbers are unity, it is found that, as in the laminar case, little detailed knowledge of the chemistry inside the boundary layer is required in most instances. the conditions at the surface and the outer edge of the boundary layer are often sufficient for prediction of heat and mass transfer. comparison is made with experiments on the combustion of graphite under turbulent flow conditions. prediction of ablation rates within about 30 percent accuracy is obtained when empirical constants obtained from incompressible velocity profiles with no mass injection are used.
