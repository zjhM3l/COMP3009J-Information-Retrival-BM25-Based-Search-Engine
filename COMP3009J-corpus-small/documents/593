theoretical considerations of flutter at high mach number. some of the theories for two-dimensional oscillatory air forces which may be applied in flutter calculations at high mach numbers are discussed. these include linear theory, van dyke's second-order theory, piston theory, landahl's method, tangent-wedge and tangent-cone approximations, newtonian theory, and a new nonlinear-pressure method. a comparison of the theories is made by showing the results of flutter calculations for mach numbers up to 10, and the possibility of flutter at these higher mach numbers is pointed out. results of flutter calculations are shown to illustrate the various effects arising from a nonlinear thickness theory. the possibility of large flutter speed thickness effects which depend on frequency ratio is shown. the influence of airfoil shape is discussed and flutter speed trends with center of gravity and elastic axis locations are presented. some possible refinements of piston theory are discussed for use at very high mach numbers. these include the use of local flow conditions and the use of newtonian theory over the leading edge of a blunt-nosed airfoil.
