shroud design for simulating hypersonic flow over the nose of a hemisphere. following is an analytical method for designing a shroud which will generate the hypersonic pressure distribution on a hemisphere. the method was found to be successful throughout the region of subsonic flow. this shroud was designed as part of a low-turbulence wind tunnel used for investigating the effects of cooling on boundary-layer transition on a hemisphere. the design of the shroud contour was carried out in two steps. first, an approximate solution for the incompressible, irrotational flow field was found in the region, and, second, the resulting contour was corrected for compressibility near the sonic region, assuming one-dimensional flow.
