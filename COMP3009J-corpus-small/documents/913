vibrations of beams on many supports. the natural frequencies of a continuous beam resting on an arbitrary number of uniformly spaced supports are determined from a difference equation formulation. these frequencies fall in periodically spaced groups that are separated by spectral gaps of widths equal to approximately half the interval between the natural frequencies of a single beam on a square root frequency scale. these groups tend to uniform spectra as the number of supports tends to infinity, but the gaps remain, giving a band-pass character to the entire spectrum. wave propagation along an infinite, periodically supported beam is discussed and the phase and group velocities evaluated as functions of frequency.
