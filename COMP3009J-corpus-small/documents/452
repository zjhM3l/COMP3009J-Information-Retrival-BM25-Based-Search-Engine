symmetric joukowsky airfoils in shear flow. the velocity components of the fluid far from the airfoil are given by where c is the chord of the airfoil, and k are constants, u and v are velocity components in the directions of the coordinates x and y. the solution is sought in the form of the stream function and satisfies laplace's equation. a general expression for for vanishing disturbance velocities at points far from the origin is written, and the flows due to a source, a vortex and a solid circular cylinder in shear flow are considered as examples. typical streamline patterns are shown for these cases. from the eulerian equations of motion the author obtains the expression for in terms of the parameter and derivatives of. the general form of is introduced and the appropriate solution for the pressure p is obtained. by integration around a contour enclosing the body, expressions are obtained, analogous to the blasius formulae, for the force and couple on any cylinder in this type of flow. these formulae are applied to the case of a symmetrical joukowsky airfoil. the method of conformal transformation is employed in the determination of. the boundary condition of tangential flow at the airfoil surface must be satisfied by the total flow in the airfoil plane, but this condition leads to a boundary condition for in the transformed plane. the kutta-joukowsky condition of finite velocity at the trailing edge also leads to a condition on in this plane. from these conditions and the general expression for the circulation and the strengths of the doublets and quadruplets required for the force and moment are determined. hence, the formulae for lift and moment coefficient are obtained. these involve, in addition to the usual (potential-flow) terms, terms proportional to. the ten functions that appear in the expressions for the lift and moment coefficients are tabulated for values of the thickness ratio between 0 and 1. the aerodynamic-center position and the coefficient of the moment about the aerodynamic center are also calculated and are presented graphically as functions of.
