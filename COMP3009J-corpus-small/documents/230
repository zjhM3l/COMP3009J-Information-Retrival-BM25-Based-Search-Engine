interference between the wings and tail plane of a slender wing-body tailplane combination. an approximate method of predicting the interference between the wings and the tailplane of a slender wing-body-tailplane combination in an inviscid flow is developed, in order to explain the change in centre of pressure position with incidence which has been found to occur in wind tunnel and flight tests on guided weapons. incidence changes in one plane only, normal to the plane containing the wings and the tail surfaces, have been considered. the method is based on slender body theory and the assumption that the wing trailing vortices roll-up completely before they reach the tailplane,. it is, therefore, applicable to weapons equipped with low aspect ratio wings far separated from the tail surfaces. when the tail surfaces are triangular and of low aspect ratio, an analytical solution is given for the effect of the wing downwash field on the tail lift. for high aspect ratio, rectangular tail surfaces it is suggested by comparison with experimental data, that the tail lift may be estimated approximately from the value of the mean downwash angle across the tail span. a summary of the method is given in para.5 which, in conjunction with the introduction, may be read independently of the rest of the report.
