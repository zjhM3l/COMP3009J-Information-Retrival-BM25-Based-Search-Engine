an approximate analytical method for studying entry into planetary atmospheres. the pair of motion equations for entry into a planetary atmosphere is reduced to a single, ordinary, nonlinear differential equation of second order by disregarding two relatively small terms and by introduring a certain mathematical transformation. the reduced equation includes various terms, certain of which represent the gravity force, the centrifugal acceleration, and the lift force. if these particular terms are disregarded, the differential equation is linear and yields precisely the solution of allen and eggers applicable to ballistic entry at relatively steep angles of descent. if all the other terms in the basic equation are disregarded (corresponding to negligible vertical acceleration and negligible vertical component of drag force), the resulting truncated differential equation yields the solution of sanger for equilibrium flight of glide vehicles with relatively large lift-drag ratios. a number of solutions for lifting and nonlifting vehicles entering at various initial angles also have been obtained from the complete nonlinear equation. these solutions are universal in the sense that a single solution determines the motion and heating of a vehicle of arbitrary weight, dimensions, and shape entering an arbitrary planetary atmosphere. one solution is required for each lift-drag ratio. these solutions are used to study the deceleration, heating rate, and total heat absorbed for entry into venus, earth, mars, and jupiter. from the equations developed for heating rates, and from available information on human tolerance limits to acceleration stress, approximate conditions for minimizing the aerodynamic heating of a trimmed vehicle with constant lift-drag ratio are established for several types of manned entry. a brief study is included of the process of atmosphere braking for slowing a vehicle from near escape velocity to near satellite velocity.
