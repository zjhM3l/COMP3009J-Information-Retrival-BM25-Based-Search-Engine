on the flow of a compressible fluid past a sphere. it was shown by raleigh (philos. mag. 32, 1 (1916)) that the velocity potential for the subsonic flow of a compressible fluid past a sphere can be expressed as a power series in terms of mach's number m (which is the ratio of the undisturbed velocity u, divided by the velocity of sound for the undisturbed flow). the equation in question is and boundary conditions are prescribed for raleigh himself computed the first two terms of this series,. the author finds the third term. he gives some graphs showing numerical differences between raleigh's and his approximation.
