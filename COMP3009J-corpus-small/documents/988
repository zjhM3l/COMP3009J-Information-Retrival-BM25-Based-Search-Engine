nonviscous flow through a pump impeller on a blade-to-blade surface of revolution. the nonviscous incompressible flow through a typical pump impeller is analyzed on a blade-to-blade surface of revolution. solutions are obtained for a variety of inlet conditions including several with prewhirl of the assumed location of the rear stagnation point. comparison of results from two approximate methods of analysis showed good agreement for the zero-angle-of-attack case and reliable indication of the existence of an eddy on the driving face at a large positive angle of attack.
