a study of flow fields about some typical blunt-nosed slender bodies. complete inviscid flow fields about three model axisymmetric configurations have been determined numerically. configurations decreasing bluntness) and flight conditions have been selected so as to indicate separately effects of nose shape, drag coefficient, flight mach number, and thermodynamic behavior of the gas (either ideal calorically perfect gas or air in equilibrium dissociation). results are presented for thirteen cases. particular attention is devoted to interpretation and, when possible, correlation of pressure distributions on, and shock shapes about, the cylindrical afterbodies. it is found that.. (a) the correlation of pressure distributions on bodies having nonspherical noses involves interpretive modifications of the law suggested by blast wave analogy. also shocks about these bodies are not described by parabolae,. (b) for all configurations there is substantial influence of gas behavior on shock shape,. this, however, can be correlated in terms of the gas conditions along a generally defined streamline,. (c) the shock layer can generally be divided into two regions (the first bound by the body and the aforementioned streamline, the second delimited by this streamline and the shock) wherein flow properties can either be approximated by simple laws or correlated.. (d) for each configuration knowledge of the complete flow field in one flight condition (even pertaining to ideal gas flow) can be used to estimate features of flows under general flight conditions including those where equilibrium dissociation is encountered.
