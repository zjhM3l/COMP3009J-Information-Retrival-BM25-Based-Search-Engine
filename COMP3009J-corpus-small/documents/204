a study of the application of airfoil section data to the estimation of the high subsonic speed characteristics of swept wings. estimates of the variation with mach number of the aerodynamic characteristics of swept wings are made on the basis of airfoil section data combined with span-loading theory. the analysis deals with examinations of some 26 wings and wing-body combinations ranging in sweep angle from 30 to 60 and for mach numbers between 0.6 and 1.0. results of the study indicate that the two-dimensional section data afford good qualitative information for such high-speed aerodynamic characteristics as the variation with mach number of drag, zero-lift pitching-moment coefficient, and lift coefficient for flow separation. quantitative estimates of the force and moment divergence mach numbers could not be made with any degree of certainty from the airfoil data alone. somewhat improved quantitative estimates for a given configuration were obtainable by basing the estimates on the measured characteristics for a wing of similar plan form but different section, and adjusting for the effects of differences in section on the basis of section data.
