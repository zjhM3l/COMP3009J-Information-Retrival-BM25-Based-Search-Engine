principles of creep buckling weight-strength analysis. a problem of creep stability of columns and plates is considered. in an analysis use is made of two forms of the creep theory based on the strain hardening hypothesis. for a uniformly compressed palte a comparison is made between the results according to the flow theory and strain theory.
