compressible flat-plate boundary-layer flow with an applied magnetic field. the laminar boundary-layer equations are formulated and solved for a flat plate in high-speed compressible air flow where equilibrium dissociation and ionization are assumed and where there is an applied magnetic field having its component normal to the plate proportional to. the skin-friction and heat-transfer characteristics are determined for free-stream velocities of up to 17,500 meters sec. and magnetic fields of up to about the results show that the skin friction and heat transfer at a given free-stream velocity decrease with increasing magnetic field strength, and the percentage reduction is constant along the length of the plate. they also exhibit the same hysteresis behavior as was first found in the case of magnetoaerodynamic couette flow,. however, for the flat plate the hysteresis effect disappears at a higher mach number. furthermore, it was found that the reduction in heat transfer with increasing field strength is opposite in behavior from that for couette flow.
