the calculation of wall shearing stress from heat-transfer measurements in compressible flows. it has been shown by ludwieg that the wall shearing stress of a laminar or turbulent boundary layer in an incompressible flow can be determined from a heat-transfer measurement at the surface. the instrument used in that investigation was essentially a small, locally insulated, heating element embedded in the test surface. the size of the instrument was restricted by the condition that the thermal boundary layer generated by the heating element be contained locally within the laminar sublayer. in the present analysis ludweig's theory for such an instrument is extended to compressible flow over an insulated flat plate. with the same limitations on the design and operation of the instrument as mentioned above, it can also be assumed for compressible laminar and turbulent boundary layers that only the flow in the immediate vicinity of the wall or the laminar sublayer will be affected in the region of the heated element. this assumption then permits the use of the laminar boundary-layer equations as the governing equations for this analysis for both laminar and turbulent boundary layers.
