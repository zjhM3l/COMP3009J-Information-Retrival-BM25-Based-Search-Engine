the problem of resistance in compressible fluids. this report is restricted to the resistance of bodies of revolution and of cylindrical bodies of infinite length moving with uniform velocity in a compressible fluid. in the case of bodies of revolution it will be assumed that the direction of the movement is parallel to the axis of symmetry. it will be assumed that the fluid satisfies the equation of state of perfect gases, i. e. const., where p denotes the pressure, the density and t the absolute temperature. in addition to obeying this equation the fluid is characterized by the statement that the intrinsic energy of the unit mass amounts to where for simplicity's sake the specific heat will be expressed in work rather than heat units. the ratio between the specific heat at constant pressure and the specific heat at constant volume will be denoted by. it is known that the value of x depends upon the number of degrees of freedom of the molecules,. if this number is denoted by n. for air the value x = 1.4 will be used. the limiting case x = 1 will be referred to as that of a assumed that in the range considered and are independent of the temperature.
