rocket propulsion systems for interplanetary flight. a comparison is made of several different propulsion systems for interplanetary flight. liquid and solid propellant rockets, propulsion systems which use nuclear energy sources, are heating rockets, magneto-plasma devices, ion rocket propulsion, solar heating rockets, and solar sails are briefly described and their current status reviewed. engine performance requirements for different interplanetary missions are established. these several propulsion systems are then compared on the basis of several performance criteria, environmental characteristics, vehicle requirements, reliability, current status, growth potential, and efficiency. predictions on various propulsion system capabilities and an analysis of multiple rocket engine reliability is included. it is concluded that electrical rockets are superior for long-time inter-planetary flight applications, and that chemical rockets are satisfactory for most of the immediate applications in /near/ space. none of the several propulsion schemes discussed can be rejected until further technical work has been accomplished.
