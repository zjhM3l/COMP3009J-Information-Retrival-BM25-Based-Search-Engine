approximate indical lift functions for several wings of finite span in incompressible flow as obtained from oscillatory lift coefficients. the unsteady-lift functions for a wing undergoing a sudden change in sinking speed have been presented for delta wings having aspect ratios of 0, 2, and 4 and for rectangular and elliptical wings having aspect ratios of 0, 3, and 6. for the elliptical and rectangular wings the spanwise lift distributions were also presented. these functions were calculated from the lift coefficients associated with a wing oscillating harmonically in pure translational motion, as obtained from several sources. the results of these calculations indicate that the normalized unsteady-lift functions are substantially independent of the shape of the plan form for elliptical, rectangular, or moderately tapered wings,. however, for delta wings the increase of lift toward the steady-state value is much more rapid than that for the aforementioned wings of the same aspect ratio. these results also corroborate the results of other investigations in that the rate of growth of lift tends to increase with a decrease in aspect ratio. the shape of the spanwise distributions of the indicial lift seems to be, for all practical purposes, independent of time for rectangular and elliptical wings.
