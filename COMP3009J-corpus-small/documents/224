quasi-cylindrical surfaces with prescribed loadings in the linearised theory of supersonic flow. a formula for the velocity field in terms of a given surface distribution of vorticity is applied to points lying on the surface. an equation giving the shape of a quasi circular-cylindrical surface in terms of a prescribed loading is derived. as an example a half ring wing with prescribed loading is discussed.
