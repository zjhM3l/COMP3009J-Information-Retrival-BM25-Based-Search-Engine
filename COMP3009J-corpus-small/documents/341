the analytical design of an axially symmetric laval nozzle for a parallel and uniform jet. the equations for the nozzle's contours are derived by integration of the characteristic equations of the axially symmetric flow. since it is not possible to integrate these equations mathematically in an exact form, it was necessary to find a way to approximate the calculations. the approximation offers itself by considering and comparing the conditions of the flow in a cone with those in a nozzle, as a linearization of the characteristic equations. the first part of the report deals with equations for the transition curve by which the conical source flow is converted into a parallel stream of uniform velocity. the equations are derived by integration along a mach line of the flow in the region where the conversion takes place. a factor f is introduced expressing a relation between the direction and the velocity of the flow along a certain mach line. f remains undetermined and is not involved in the final equations. in the second part of the report, the spherical sonic flow section is converted into a plane circular section of the throat. the nozzle's contour adjacent to the throat is formed by the arc of a circle connected with the transition curve by a straight line. the gas dynamic properties of the boundary mach line are calculated in table 1, the use of which shortens the calculations considerably.
