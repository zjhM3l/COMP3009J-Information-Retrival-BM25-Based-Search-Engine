iterative methods for solving partial difference equations of elliptic type. this paper considers linear systems /1/ where a includes matrices of a sort frequently occurring in the solution of elliptic partial differential equations by difference methods /in particular, a o/. rewriting superscript is number of iteration cycle/ are used to compute u when u are used. also, one may /over-relax/.. ser. a. 210, 307-357 /1910/ who suggested changing from time to time to speed up convergence. in the present paper over-relaxation /with fixed w/ is combined with immediate introduction of newly-computed u's, a la gauss-seidel. various theorems on convergence are proved$. in particular, it is shown that there exists an ordering of the equations and an optimum value wb such that in general /3/ converges much more rapidly than the gauss-seidel method /w 1/. means are suggested for estimating wb,. the sensitivity of the rate of convergence to the choice of w is studied. the paper concludes with a theoretical comparison of gauss-seidel and the method proposed, /successive over-relaxation/, for solving dirichlet's difference problem over a square using a high-speed computing machine.
