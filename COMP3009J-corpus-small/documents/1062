an experimental and theoretical investigation of second-order wing-body interference at high mach number. the second-order wing-body interference theory of landahl and beane is used in the theoretical calculation of the pressure distributions over the wing of a wing-body combination. results are compared with experimental values obtained from wind-tunnel tests, at a mach number of 7.35, on a cone-cylinder non-lifting body with a triangular wing of wedge section set at incidences of 0, 3, 6 and 10. it is shown that interference effects can be very large and can be calculated theoretically with good accuracy.
