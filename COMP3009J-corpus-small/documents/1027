note on creep buckling of columns. a phenomenological relation between stress, strain rate, and temperature is suggested to account for the behavior of polycrystalline metals above the equicohesive temperature. the properties of the metal included in the relation are elasticity, linear thermal expansion, and viscosity. the relation may be integrated under various conditions to provide information on creep rates, creep rupture, stress-strain curves, and rapid-heating curves. it is shown that for one material - 7075-t6 aluminum-alloy sheet - the information yielded by the relation for these four applications agrees reasonably well with test data.
