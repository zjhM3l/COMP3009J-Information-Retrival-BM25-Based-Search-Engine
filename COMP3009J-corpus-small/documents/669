subsonic potential flow past a sphere inside a cylindrical duct. the subsonic potential flow of a compressible fluid past a sphere in an infinite medium was first determined by rayleigh. subsequently, caplan and tamada extended the solution to include the fourth power of the mach number. to the author's knowledge, no solution for subsonic flow past a sphere in a finite medium has been published. it is the purpose of this note to present a solution for subsonic potential flow past a sphere inside a circular cylindrical duct.
