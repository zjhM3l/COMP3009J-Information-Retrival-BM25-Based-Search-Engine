an experimental study of the effect of downwash from a twin-propeller vtol aircraft on several types of ground surfaces. a full-scale, twin-propeller vtol aircraft with a maximum gross weight of 3,400 pounds has been operated on the ground to study the effect of downwash on several types of ground surfaces. static operation over loose snow indicated a zone of obliterated vision ahead of the pilot in an arc of approximately 10 on each side of the plane of symmetry. an arc 10 to 45 each side of the center line was found to be an area of fair visibility while the arc from 45 to 90 was an area of poor visibility. static operation in the presence of loose surface material indicated that the downwash cleared the area near the aircraft of these particles without recirculation or damage to any components. short-time operation at moderate forward speed over loose gravel, with the thrust axis at an angle of in propeller-blade erosion and numerous small dents and fabric punctures in the sides of the fuselage. the propeller-blade erosion was superficial except for the leading edges where several layers of glass fiber were eroded.
