the solution of the equations of the laminar boundary layer for schubauer's observed pressure distribution for an elliptic cylinder. the solution of the equations of the laminar boundary layer has been carried out for the pressure distribution for an elliptic cylinder of axial ratio 2.96.. 1 with its major axis in the direction of the incident stream. the solution has been obtained by the method of hartree and womersley. in applying this method the derivatives parallel to the boundary are replaced by finite differences, so that the partial differential equation of the boundary layer is replaced by an ordinary equation relating the velocity distribution through the boundary layer at one section to that at another, at an interval upstream. by two independent integrations covering the same range by finite intervals of different sizes, it is possible to estimate the errors involved in replacing the derivatives by finite differences, and so to correct for these errors. the process of solution requires the values of the pressure gradient along the solid boundary, and there is a certain tolerance in the derivation of the pressure gradient distribution from a limited number of observed values of pressure. an analysis of schubauer's pressure distribution is outlined, and the results were used for the main solution calculated. it is found that the solution, for the distribution of pressure gradient so derived, does not give separation of the boundary layer from the solid boundary, whereas the actual flow does separate. it is found that the calculated solution is very sensitive to the pressure distribution, and a comparatively small modification of the pressure distribution gives a solution which does indicate separation close to the point at which separation is observed to occur. the solution with this pressure distribution also gives very good agreement with the observed velocity distribution through the boundary layer at points upstream from separation.
