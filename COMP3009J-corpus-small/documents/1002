preliminary investigations of spiked bodies at hypersonic speeds. generally accepted solutions for the problems of hypersonic flight appear, at the moment, to be centered around the use of blunt bodies to minimize the heat-transfer rates. there are, however, several other solutions to the problem, and, as part of an exploratory study of these solutions, a detailed examination has been made of the flow over blunt bodies equipped with a spike. these tests, carried out at a mach number of about 14 in the princeton helium hypersonic tunnel, have investigated the effect of varying spike lengths for flat-faced and hemispherically-nosed axially symmetric bodies. detailed pressure distributions have been obtained as well as heat-transfer rates. these exploratory studies have shown that the use of a spike protruding from a hemispherical-nosed cylinder at m 14 decreased the pressure level by an order of magnitude and the heat transfer to a fraction of that measured on a hemisphere without a spike. the general technique appears to hold considerable promise for hypersonic flight.
