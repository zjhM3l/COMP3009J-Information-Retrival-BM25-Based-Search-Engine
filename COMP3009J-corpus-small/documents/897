some results on buckling and postbuckling of cylindrical shells. in this summary paper, the effects of initial deformations on the buckling and postbuckling characteristics of circular cylindrical shells under hydrostatic pressure is determined in an approximate manner. the influence of initial axisymmetric deformations is stressed. also, the classical buckling of an axially compressed, noncircular the results show that the major-minor axis ratio of the cross section has a marked effect on the critical load, and that use of the maximum radius of curvature in the formula for the classical buckling stress of a circular cylindrical shell leads to good results for moderate eccentricities.
