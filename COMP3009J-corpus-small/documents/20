generalised-newtonian theory. author generalizes lees's (amr 10(1957), rev. 2601) modification of newtonian theory for blunt-nose bodies to apply to pointed- nose bodies as well. the result is expressed by sin where is the local inclination of the body surface and the subscript /max/ refers to the maximum local inclination and pressure coefficient. for blunt-nose bodies and the generalized theory reverts to lees's blunt-nose modification with given by normal shock relations. author shows, by comparison of newtonian and generalized-newtonian theory with exact solutions, the superiority of generalized-newtonian theory. he also shows that both two-dimensional and axisymmetric shapes are correlated by this generalization. results are presented in two figures that support author's generalization and indicate the independence of the correlation from variations in both the hypersonic similarity parameter k = m(d1) and the ratio of specific heats y. reviewer believes this generalization should be of interest to those engaged in development of hypersonic hardware as well as theory.
