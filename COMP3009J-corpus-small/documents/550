laminar heat transfer in tubes under slip-flow conditions. the effects of low-density phenomena on the fully developed heat-transfer characteristics for laminar flow in tubes has been studied analytically. consideration is given to the slip-flow regime wherein the major rarefaction effects are manifested as velocity and temperature jumps at the tube wall. the analysis is carried out for both uniform wall temperature and uniform wall heat flux. in both cases, the slip-flow nusselt numbers are lower than those for continuum flow and decrease with increasing mean free path. extension of the results is made to include the effects of shear work at the wall, temperature jump modifications for a moving fluid, and thermal creep.
