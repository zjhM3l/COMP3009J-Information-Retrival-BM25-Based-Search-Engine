a theory of imperfection for the vibrations of elastic bodies of revolution. various observations and preliminary experiments have shown that the effect of imperfections upon the vibrations of bodies of revolution cannot be neglected. owing to the possibility of applying the lagrange equation, the influence of the imperfections could be traced through the kinetic energy, the potential energy and the dissipation function. although the fundamental difficulty of the uncertainty of certain variables was not eliminated, this procedure permitted at least the making of general qualitative statements as to the behaviour of the system if imperfections are present.
