boundary layer transition with gas injection. the mass-injection process has been proposed as a method of cooling aerodynamic surfaces, and, since the amount of coolant required to maintain practical wall temperatures is considerably larger for turbulent than for laminar boundary layers, knowledge of the effect of the cooling method on the transition process is certainly important. exploratory studies reported here were conducted at mach number 3.7 to ascertain the effects of gas injection on the stability of the laminar boundary layer on a conical surface.
