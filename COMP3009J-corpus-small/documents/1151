experiments on supersonic blunt-body flows. recently, progress has been made in the theoretical calculation of the inviscid flow between the detached shock wave and the surface of a blunt body travelling at supersonic speed. detailed experimental data are needed for comparison. experiments have been made in the supersonic wind tunnels of the jet propulsion laboratory on spheres, disks, and blunted cones over the mach number range 1.8 to 5.0 in air. surface pressures, shock wave shape and detachment distance, certain velocity gradients, the sonic line location, and some streamline paths were determined. the sonic line is found as the trace of the termination point of a weak shock generated by a probe ahead of the model. for a sphere, good agreement between theory (of van dyke) and experiment is found.
