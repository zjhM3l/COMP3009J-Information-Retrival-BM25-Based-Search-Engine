oscillatory derivative measurements on sting-mounted wind tunnel models method of test and results for pitch and yaw on a cambered ogee wing at mach numbers up to 2. 6. this report describes a method which has been developed for measuring oscillatory derivatives on sting-mounted models in the 8 ft by 8 ft supersonic tunnel at r.a.e. bedford. direct and cross derivatives with respect to angular displacements and velocities in pitch and yaw have been measured satisfactorily, and results are given of tests on a cambered ogee wing at six mach numbers from 0.2 to 2.6. some tests were made on this model in the course of the preliminary development work in the 13 ft by 9 ft low speed wind tunnel, and results of these are included.
