a nonlinear theory of bending and buckling of thin elastic shallow spherical shells. a shallow spherical dome subjected to lateral pressure is a structure for which the deformation departs appreciably from the linear theory at relatively small values of the deflection amplitude. it is also one for which the buckling process is characterized by a rapid decrease in the equilibrium load once the buckling load has been surpassed. for structures having this type of buckling characteristics the question arises as to whether the proper buckling criterion to apply is the classical criterion, which considers equilibrium with respect to infinitesimal displacements, or the finite-displacement /energy criterion/ proposed by tsien. in this paper the problem of the finite displacement and buckling of a shallow spherical dome is investigated both theoretically and experimentally. in the theoretical approach the nonlinear equations are converted into a sequence of linear equations by expanding all of the variables in powers of the center deflection and then equating the coefficients of equal powers. the basic parameter for the shallow dome is proportional to the ratio of the central height of the dome h to its thickness t. for small values of this ratio the expansions converge rapidly and enough terms are computed to determine the buckling load according to the classical criterion. for higher values of h t, convergence deteriorates rapidly and it was not possible to determine the buckling load with the number of terms which were computed. however even for these higher values of h t the deflection shapes are determined for deflection amplitudes below the amplitude at which buckling occurs. these deflection shapes are characterized by their rapid change as h t increases and by the fact that, over most of the range of h t studied, the maximum deflection does not occur at the center of the dome. experimental results seem to indicate that the classical criterion of buckling is applicable to very shallow spherical domes for which the theoretical calculation was made. a transition to energy criterion for higher domes is also indicated.
