a note on application of transonic linearization to an airfoil with a round leading edge. the profile of a symmetric airfoil of unit length with a round leading edge can be expressed, in general, as where p(x) has a finite slope at x = 0. it is well known that the conventional sub- and supersonic linear theories of compressible flow break down in the neighborhood of such a round leading edge due to the failure of the small-disturbance assumption. the linearized transonic flow theory has the same short-coming, but if the determination of the sonic point on the airfoil plays an important role in any more advanced theory--e.g., spreiter's local-linearization method or hosokawa's method of refinement--this theoretical barrier will become more serious because the sonic point is usually located in a flow region near the leading edge that may be greatly affected by the roundness.
