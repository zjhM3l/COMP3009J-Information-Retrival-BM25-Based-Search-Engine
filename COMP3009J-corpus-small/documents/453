the influence of two-dimensional stream shear on airfoil maximum lift. the cornell aeronautical laboratory is conducting a program of theoretical and experimental research on low-speed aerodynamics as applied to stol and vtol aircraft. the objective of this program is to re-examine certain aspects of classical aerodynamic information, in the light of low-speed flight requirements, with the aim of seeking aerodynamic processes which might be exploited to enhance law-speed performance. one aspect of propeller-driven aircraft which has recently received increasing attention is the existence of strong gradients of longitudinal velocity, or shear, in the propeller slipstream. this slipstream shear interacts with a wing surface and can alter the wing characteristics. in theoretical treatments of a wing interacting with a propeller slipstream, the first important simplification is the replacement of the slipstream with an ideal uniform jet, free of all velocity gradients. the application of these theories requires that one equate the actual slipstream to an effective uniform jet. one method employed is to assume the uniform jet has a momentum flux equal to the average in the propeller slipstream. these and similar procedures are well founded on momentum considerations., however, the implicit assumption is that the flow nonuniformity, the shear, does not influence the wing characteristics.
