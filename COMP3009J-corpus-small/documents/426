preliminary analysis of axial flow compressors having supersonic velocity at the entrance of the stator. a supersonic compressor design having supersonic velocity at the entrance of the stator is analyzed on the assumption of two-dimensional flow. the rotor and stator losses assumed in the analysis are based on the results of preliminary supersonic cascade tests. the results of the analysis show that compression ratios per stage of 6 to 10 can be obtained with adiabatic efficiency between 70 and 80 percent. consideration is also given in the analysis to the starting, stability, and range of efficient performance of this type of compressor. the desirability of employing variable-geometry stators and adjustable inlet guide vanes is indicated. although either supersonic or subsonic axial component of velocity at the stator entrance can be used, the cascade test results suggest that higher pressure recovery can be obtained if the axial component is supersonic.
