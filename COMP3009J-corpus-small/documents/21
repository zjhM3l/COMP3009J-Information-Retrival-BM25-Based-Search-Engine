on heat transfer in slip flow. a number of authors have considered the effect of slip on the heat transfer and skin friction in a laminar boundary layer over a flat plate. reference 1 considers this by a perturbation on the usual laminar boundary-layer analysis while some other studies.dash e.g., reference the impulsive motion of an infinite plate.
