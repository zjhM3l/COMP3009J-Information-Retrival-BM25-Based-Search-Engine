on the propagation and structure of the blast wave. part 1. as a continuation of part 1 (j. phys. soc. japan 8 (1953) 662), the second approximation for the propagation and structure of a blast wave is now discussed. the solution for r=1.4 is obtained by a numerical method, using the results of the first approximation obtained in part 1. by use of this solution, u-r curves, distance-time curves and the changing feature of distributions of velocity, pressure and density behind the shock front are discussed. further, the approximate solution of the equation is discussed by a refinement of the wkb method due to imai.
