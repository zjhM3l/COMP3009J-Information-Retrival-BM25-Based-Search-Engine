effect of roughness on transition in supersonic flow. further experiments carried out in the 12-inch supersonic wind tunnel of the jet propulsion laboratory of the california institute of technology to investigate the effect of three-dimensional roughness elements (spheres) on boundary-layer transition on a 10 transfer are reported herein. the local mach number for these tests was minimum (effective) size of trip required to bring transition to its lowest reynolds number varies as the one-fourth power of the distance from the apex of the cone to the trip. use of available data at other mach numbers indicates that the mach number influence for effective tripping is taken into account by the simple expression.
