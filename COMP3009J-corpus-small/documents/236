criteria for thermodynamic equilibrium in gas flow. when gases flow at high velocity, the rates of internal processes may not be fast enough to maintain thermodynamic equilibrium. by defining quasi-equilibrium in flow as the condition in which the temperature, pressure, density, and velocity deviate by less than a fixed, small percentage from what they would be if the flowing gas could actually be in thermodynamic equilibrium, criteria are derived for determining whether quasi-equilibrium is a stable condition in the flow. by use of excitation of molecular vibration as an example, the general properties of criteria curves are discussed and interpreted. a discussion is given of how to use these results to determine definitely whether a flow is or is not in thermodynamic equilibrium. applications to dissociating gases, to mixtures, and to the phenomenon of /choking/ in a laval nozzle are given special consideration. for cases when application of the criteria predict nonequilibrium, equations are provided in a form useful for numerical forward integration along streamlines.
