analytical and experimental investigation of stress distributions in long flat plates subjected to lingitudinal loads and transverse temperature gradients. stress and strain distributions were studied in long flat plates in order to develop practical analytical procedures for the design analysis of aircraft structures at elevated temperatures. various load-temperature conditions are presented. these include.. methods of analysis for calculation of stress distributions under and plastic range,. ture. experimental verification of the analytical procedures is shown with comparisons between the use of constant room temperature or temperature dependent values of modulus of elasticity and coefficient of thermal expansion. the test specimen, equipment, instrumentation, and experimental program are discussed in detail. experimental data obtained from the specimen and associated material control coupon tests are presented.
