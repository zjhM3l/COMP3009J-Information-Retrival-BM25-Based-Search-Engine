the contraction of satellite orbits under the influence of air drag part i. with spherically symmetrical atmosphere. the effect of air drag on satellite orbits of small eccentricity e/0.2/ is studied analytically by a perturbation method, on the assumption that the atmosphere is spherically symmetrical. equations are derived which show/1/how orbital period and perigee distance vary with eccentricity as the orbit contracts, and/2/how each of these quantities varies with time. the equations of type/1/are nearly independent of the oblateness of the atmosphere. in all the equations, terms of order e and higher are usually neglected. the results are also presented graphically, in a manner designed for practical use. the theory is to be extended to an oblate atmosphere in part ii, and will later be compared with observation.
