reaction-resisted shock fronts. it is shown that shock waves whose structure is determined solely by the effects of chemical reactions (reaction-resisted shock fronts) are possible and completely analogous to relaxation - resisted waves. a single dissociation reaction is considered and numerical results indicate that such waves could be observed experimentally. bulk viscosities equivalent to reaction effects are possibly 10 or more times shear viscosity values. (examples are based on lighthill's ideal dissociating gas).
