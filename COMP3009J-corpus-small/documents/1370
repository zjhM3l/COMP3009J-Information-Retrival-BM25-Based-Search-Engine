some remarks on the flat plate boundary layer. the authors discuss the solutions for the flow of a viscous incompressible fluid near the leading edge of a semi-infinite flat plate without pressure gradient. the oseen linearization is employed which approximates the equations of motion and continuity by where are the coordinate directions, the corresponding velocity components and the uniform free stream velocity which is parallel to the plate. defining a perturbation stream function by the differential equation to be solved is with boundary conditions far from the plate and when y=0 and. the authors discuss the problem by applying the two-dimensional fourier transform and obtain an explicit solution for the velocity gradient at the plate which is in disagreement with the result of the blasius solution. from this the authors conclude that it would be more appropriate to use a velocity other than in the linearization of the equations of motion and suggest replacing by where. this choice does not affect the solution far from the plate but gives on the plate and in comparison with blasius solution indicates that c=0.35. the solution of the modified oseen equation with this value of c then seems acceptable as the approximate solution in the region intermediate between the stokes flow and the free stream. on the basis of these considerations, the authors suggest an iteration procedure for obtaining the exact solution for the above problem as well as a solution for the plate of finite length.
