vibrations of infinitely long cylindrical shells under initial stress. the general bending theory of shells under the influence of initial stress presented recently by herrmann and armenakas is applied in this investigation to study the effect of initial uniform circumferential stress, uniform bending moment and uniform radial shear on the dynamic response of an infinitely long cylindrical shell.
