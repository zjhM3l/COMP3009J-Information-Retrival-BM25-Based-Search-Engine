investigation of the laminar aerodynamics heat transfer characteristics of a hemisphere cylinder in the langley 11-inch hypersonic tunnel at a mach number of 6. 8. a program to investigate the aerodynamic heat transfer of a nonisothermal hemisphere-cylinder has been conducted in the langley 11-inch hypersonic tunnel at a mach number of 6.8 and a reynolds number from approximately 0.14x10 to experimental heat-transfer coefficients were slightly less over the whole body than those predicted by the theory of stine and wanlass (naca technical note 3344) for an isothermal surface. for stations within 45 of the stagnation point the heat-transfer coefficients could be correlated by a single relation between local stanton number and local reynolds number. pitot pressure profiles taken at a mach number of 6.8 on a hemisphere-cylinder have verified that the local mach number or velocity outside the boundary layer required in the theories may be computed from the surface pressures by using isentropic flow relations and conditions immediately behind a normal shock. the experimental pressure distribution at a mach number of velocity gradients calculated at the stagnation point by using the modified newtonian theory vary with mach number and are in good agreement with those obtained from measured pressures for mach numbers from 1.2 to 6.8. at the stagnation point the theory of sibulkin, in which the diameter and conditions behind the normal shock were used, was in good agreement with the experiment when the velocity gradient at the stagnation point appropriate to the free-stream mach number was used.
