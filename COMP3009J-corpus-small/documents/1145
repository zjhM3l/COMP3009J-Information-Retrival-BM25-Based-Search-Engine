buckling of core-stabilized cylinders under axisymmetric external loads. an equation is derived for the elastic stability of a circular cylindrical shell which is filled with a soft elastic core and is subjected to general axially-symmetric lateral pressure combined with a central axial force. numerical results are given for three lateral pressure distributions of interest in rocket motor case analysis.. uniform pressure, linearly varying pressure, and a circumferential band of pressure located at an arbitrary distance from one end of the cylinder. comparison is made with results of previous theoretical and experimental investigations, where available.
