pressure distribution and surface flow on 5( and 9( thick wings with curved tip and 60degree sweepback. extensive tables are given of pressure coefficients measured at reynolds numbers from 1.3x10 to 3.9x10 on two half-models of identical planform with 5( rae 101 and 9( rae 101 streamwise sections. the planform of aspect ratio 3.899 has a straight trailing edge with 60degree of sweepback, constant chord over most of the span and a parabolic outer portion of the leading edge curving to a pointed tip. the overall wing characteristics are obtained from integrated normal pressures and are compared with lifting-surface theory. the low-speed experimental pressure distributions and surface oil-flow patterns are analysed and discussed in relation to the onset of separation and the distinct vortex flows that develop at high incidence. series of contrasting upper-surface isobars illustrate some features of the different stalling processes of the two wings. the direct influence of the main vortex on local surface pressures is assessed in general terms. a fuller appraisal of secondary surface flow is obtained from the oil patterns, observations in water and measurements of high suction near the trailing edge. studies of the extent of leading-edge stall and location of part-span vortices, in particular two simultaneous leading-edge vortices on the thinner wing, follow from further analysis of local surface pressures. after a detailed discussion of the effect of reynolds number and the distinct types of separated flow, a few results with leading-edge roughness are considered in relation to scale effect on separation and the extensive influence of part-span roughness.
