a mixing theory for the interaction between dissipative flows and nearly isentropic streams. by means of a simplified theoretical /model,/ the present paper treats the general class of flow problems characterized by the interaction between a viscous or dissipative flow near the surface of a solid body, or in its wake, and an /outer/ nearly isentropic stream. for the present, the external flow is taken to be a plane, steady, supersonic flow, which makes a small angle with a plane surface or plane of symmetry, although the methods used can be extended to curved surfaces, to axially symmetric supersonic flows, and also to subsonic flows. the internal dissipative flow is regarded as quasi-one-dimensional and parallel to the surface on the average, with a properly defined mean velocity and mean temperature. the nonuniformity of the actual velocity distribution is taken into account only approximately by means of a relation between mean temperature and mean velocity. mixing, or the transport of momentum from outer stream to dissipative flow, is considered to be the fundamental physical process determining the pressure rise that can be supported by the flow. with the aid of this concept, a large number of flow problems is shown to be basically similar, such as boundary-layer shockwave interaction, wake flow behind blunt-based bodies (base pressure problem), flow separation in overexpanded supersonic nozzles, separation on wings and bodies, etc.
