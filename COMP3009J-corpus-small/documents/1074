theoretical and experimental investigation of second-order supersonic wing-body interference. approximate second-order solutions for the supersonic flow around wing-body combinations are calculated, using two different theoretical models small and the wing sweep small in comparison with that of the mach cone are considered. the analysis is restricted to such high mach numbers that m-2 1, and an approximate formula common to the two models is then found for the second-order interference term. this formula can also be used to correct experimental pressure distributions for the effect of nonuniformities in the wind-tunnel flow. in order to test the theory, wind-tunnel experiments on non-lifting cone-cylinder bodies in combination with wings of simple shapes were performed. pressure distributions were measured at m 3 and m 4, both around the bodies and on the wings separately, as well as in combination, and it was found that the second-order interference was predicted reasonably well by the simplified theory.
