subsonic aerodynamic flutter derivatives for wings and control surfaces, /compressible and incompressible flow/. this report gives tables of the two-dimensional subsonic flutter derivatives,. where possible the values given are based on the published work of various authors, but some have been specially calculated for this report. wing derivatives are given for mach numbers 0, 0.5, 0.6 and 0.7 for the frequency parameter range 0 /0.04/ 0.2 /0.2/ 1.6 and mach numbers 0 and 0.7 for frequency parameter 5.0. control surface derivatives are given for mach numbers 0 and 0.7 for control surface/ wing chord ratios 0.02 /0.02/ 0.10 /0.05/ 0.50 and frequency parameters are also given for mach numbers 0, 0.5, 0.6 and 0.7 for frequency parameter 0 /0.04/ 0.2 /0.2/ 1.4. control surface-tab derivatives are given for some particular values of the variables and methods of obtaining approximate values of these derivatives for other values of the variables are suggested. control surface and tab derivatives are in all cases for no aerodynamic balance.
