some instabilities arising from the interaction between shock waves and boundary layer. a brief review is made of the available information concerning the flow fluctuations and instabilities arising from shock-induced separation in the flow over aerofoils and wings. the influence this phenomenon has on the oscillatory behaviour of aerofoils and control surfaces is also briefly discussed. a more detailed consideration is devoted to a recent investigation at the n.p.l. into the part played by shock-induced separation in the instability of a control surface.
