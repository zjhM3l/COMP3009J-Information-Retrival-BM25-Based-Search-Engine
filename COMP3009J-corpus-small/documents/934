stability of cylindrical and conical shells of circular cross section, with simultaneous action of axial compression and external normal pressure. we consider in this report the determination of the upper limit of critical loads in the case of simultaneous action of a compressive force, uniformly distributed over plane cross sections, and of isotropic external normal pressure on cylindrical or conical shells of circular cross section. as a starting point we use the differential equations for neutral equilibrium of conical shells (ref. 1) which have been used for the solution of the problem of stability of conical shells under torsion and under axial compression (ref. 2),. upon solution of the problem it is possible to satisfy all boundary conditions, in contrast to the report (ref. 3) where no attention is paid to the fulfillment of the boundary conditions and to the report (ref. 4) where only part of the boundary conditions are satisfied by solution of the problem according to galerkin's method. approximate formulas are used for the determination of the critical external normal pressure with simultaneous action of longitudinal compression. let us note that the formulas suggested in reference 5 are not well founded and may lead, in a number of cases, to a substantial mistake in the magnitude of the critical load.
