long slender delta wings with leading edge separation. the slender-body approximation of linearized compressible flow is applied to the problem of a delta wing in which flow separation occurs at the leading edges. the vortex sheets found in the real flow are approximated by concentrated vortices with feeding lattices, and a plausible adaptation of kelvin's theorem is applied to simulate the force-free nature of the vortex sheet. the computations show that leading-edge separation produces an increase in lift over that given by the jones slender-wing theory and that the lift does not vary linearly with angle of attack. computed pressure distributions and span loadings are presented and the theoretical lift results are compared with the results of simple force tests made at a mach number of 1.9.
