the 7 in. x 7 in. hypersonic wind tunnel at r.a.e., farnborough part iii - calibration of the flow in the working section. the fused silica nozzle to give m=7 in the 7 in. x 7 in. hypersonic wind tunnel produces a flow field with an average mach number of 6.85 along the centreline of the working section. the mach number gradually decreases towards the boundary layer, and over a core of approximately mach number. the nozzle heats up during a run but this has little effect on the mach number distribution. at one station the mach number was one-third per cent greater for a run of 1 minute than for a run of 10 seconds. the temperature field in the inviscid flow has an average variation of in temperature with time throughout a run.
