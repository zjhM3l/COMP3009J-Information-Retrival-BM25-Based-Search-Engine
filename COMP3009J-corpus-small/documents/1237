foreign-gas injection into a compressible turbulent boundary layer on a flat plate. the distributed injection of a foreign gas into a compressible, turbulent boundary layer in the absence of a pressure gradient is considered. the analysis is performed within the framework of the binary-mixture concept, that is, the primary fluid flowing over the surface represents one component while the injected species represents the second. calculations have been performed for the injection of helium into undissociated air. the results indicate an effect of mach number on surface shear and energy transfer when distributed light-gas injection normal to the surface exists. a comparison with experimental data indicates reasonable agreement over a range of mach numbers.
