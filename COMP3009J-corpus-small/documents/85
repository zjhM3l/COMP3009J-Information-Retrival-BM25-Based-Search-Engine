on trails of axisymmetric hypersonic blunt bodies flying through the atmosphere. the trail left in the atmosphere by a body moving at hypersonic speeds is the subject of theoretical treatment. the times required for ionization and dissociation (and their inverse processes) to go to completion, when compared to the flow times of a gas particle, are important in determining the observable effects of hypersonic trails-i.e., emitted thermal radiation and reflection of electromagnetic waves from the trail. in order to simplify the theoretical treatment, the trail is divided into two regions.. (1) the expansion-controlled trail, which treats the behavior of the wake behind the body up to a point, along the direction of flight, where the pressure decays to the free-stream value and cooling is controlled principally by the expansion of the flow, and (2) the conduction-controlled trail, where the trail cools mainly by diffusion of heat away from the high-temperature core. the influence of the details of the body shape on the observables are discussed and a simple computational procedure for the behavior of the conduction-controlled trail is developed based on integral methods. results of calculations that assume thermodynamic equilibrium of the flow field give the values of the thermodynamic variables in the trail of a sphere, axial distributions of emitted thermal radiation, and maps of electron density distribution. it is shown that the cooling of the conduction-controlled trail is essentially due to conduction of heat and that viscous effects are not important. it is found that this portion of the trail does not widen as one proceeds downstream. flight velocities considered vary between 15,000 and 35,000 ft sec and altitudes range between 100,000 and 250,000 ft.
