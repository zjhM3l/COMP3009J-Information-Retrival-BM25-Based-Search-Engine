on transverse vibrations of thin, shallow elastic shells. an experimental investigation was made (1) to evaluate previously published theoretical procedures for the prediction of stress distribution for cases of radially symmetric abrupt change in wall thickness of thin-walled cylinders subject to internal pressure and (2) to investigate the significance of stresses attributable to the presence of thickness changes typical of design practice. one theory was adequate in itself for solution of the case of continuous middle surface,. use of the second theoretical procedure was required to determine the additional stresses arising from discontinuous middle surfaces at the change in thickness. comparisons were made between theoretical and experimental stress distributions for cases with continuous middle and continuous inner surfaces for radially symmetric changes in wall thickness of a cylinder subject to internal pressure for diameter to larger wall thickness ratios of 117 and 28 and for the case of a continuous outer surface for a ratio of 28. in all tests the ratio of wall thicknesses at the change in wall thickness was 0.4. there was reasonably good correlation between theoretical and experimental curves of stress distribution. on the basis of this correlation, it was concluded that the applicable theories were valid. it was shown that inclusion of the stresses arising from the condition of discontinuous middle surfaces at a change in thickness has an important effect on stress distribution. in the case of a cylinder with a continuous outer surface, the maximum mean effective stress was of sufficient magnitude to indicate that this geometry should be avoided in design if possible. the maximum mean effective stress was not increased to a significant degree by the presence of a change in wall thickness in the other cases.
