several magnetohydrodynamic free-convection solutions. the influence of transverse magnetic fields on the laminar free-convection flow of liquid metals over a vertical flat plate and between vertical parallel plates is examined for specific wall temperature variations and prandtl numbers. the extent of influence on the flow and temperature fields is determined by the magnitude of a nondimensional influence parameter which is the ratio of the magnetic force to the buoyant force. in general, increasing the magnetic field strength decreases the magnitude of the velocity, wall shear, and surfaces heat transfer and increases the temperature throughout the fluid. analytical results demonstrate that magnetic fields of practical strengths exert considerable influence on liquid metal free-convection flow fields.
