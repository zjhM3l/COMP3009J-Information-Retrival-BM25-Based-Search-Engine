some measurements in the vortex flow generated by a sharp leading edge having 65 sweep. the report is concerned with the vortex flow which arises when separation occurs at a highly swept leading edge. measurements were made in the flow over flat plates at 15 incidence each having a sharp leading edge of 65 sweep. the pressure and velocity distributions both along the axis of the vortex and for one cross section of the flow are presented together with a preliminary discussion of their significance.
