photo-thermoelasticity. this paper summarizes the optical and physical properties of the photoelastic model material paraplex p-43 over the temperature range from room temperature to -40 f. descriptions are presented of techniques and equipment developed to obtain the modulus of elasticity, the material fringe value, and the thermal-expansion coefficient as a function of temperature. experimental investigations were conducted into the plane-stress problems of a disk contracting upon an elastic inclusion and the transient thermal-stress field produced by a temperature differential suddenly applied to the upper edge of a long beam. the data are correlated with theory using the material properties obtained in the calibration phase. also included are photographic results of an exploratory investigation of the thermal-shock phenomenon produced by the sudden application of a temperature differential upon plastic beams of various length-depth ratios.
