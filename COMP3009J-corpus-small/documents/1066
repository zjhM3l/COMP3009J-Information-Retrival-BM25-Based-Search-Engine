wind tunnel measurements of aerodynamic damping derivatives of a launch vehicle vibrating in free-free bending modes at mach numbers from 0. 70 to 2. 87 and comparisons with theory. the aerodynamic damping of a flexibly mounted aeroelastic model with a blunted conical nose and a cylindrical afterbody was measured at mach numbers from 0.70 to 1.20 at several levels of dynamic pressure and two weight conditions and at mach numbers from 1.76 to 2.87 at one weight condition. the first two free-free flexible modes of vibration were investigated. also investigated at mach numbers from 0.9 to 1.2 was the aerodynamic damping in the first free-free modes of a model which had a /hammerhead/ nose (the base diameter of the blunted cone was greater than the diameter of the afterbody which necessitated a reflex angle downstream from the cone base). two basically different methods, the /electrical power-input/ and the /decaying oscillations/ methods were used to determine the damping and frequencies. the experimentally determined values are compared with some applicable theories. the results of the investigation indicate that the aerodynamic damping in the elastic modes of vibration was small for all configurations tested. the maximum aerodynamic damping measured in the first mode was on the order of damping. the aerodynamic damping was found to be even less for vibration modes higher than the first. reduced-frequency effects were found to be negligible for the range investigated. agreement of calculated aerodynamic damping derivatives with the experimental results was not good. generally, the experimentally determined derivatives were larger than those predicted by the various theories used. the bond-packard theory appeared to give the best agreement for the first free-free vibration mode but gave the worst agreement for the second mode. measurements made on the configuration that had a hammerhead nose indicated small negative aerodynamic damping in the mach number range from 0.95 to 1.00. aerodynamic stiffness effects were found to be small and within the experimental scatter. (wind-on frequency determination was accurate only to approximately 1 percent.)
