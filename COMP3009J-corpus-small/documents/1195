experiments with two-dimensional, transversely impinging jets. experiments on the interaction of transversely impinging two-dimensional jet flows were performed in which a low pressure control jet flow interacted with a relatively high pressure power jet flow. the ratio of the control jet to the power jet supply chamber gauge stagnation pressure was adjusted at 0, 10, and 15. shadowgraphs of the power jet alone, as well as the corresponding interacting jet flows, were recorded to establish the nature of and changes in the shock structure. the jet flows were traversed by a pitot tube to record the pitot pressure distributions at various locations downstream of the power jet exit. it was discovered that with the addition of only a small percent control jet flow, the normal shock front of the highly underexpanded power jet flow changed to an oblique shock structure and, downstream of the previous location of the normal shock which appeared in the power jet flow alone, the maximum recovery stagnation pressures were proportionally much higher. the mechanism for this behavior of the normal shock is proposed. possible practical importance of this behavior of interacting jet flows with reference to aerodynamic noise, supersonic diffuser losses, etc., is also pointed out. for the power jet flow alone it was found that by considering the actual jet boundaries as simply an extension of the actual nozzle, the average axial flow quantities, computed from the area-mach number relation using the observed cross-sectional area of the jet flow, agreed quite favorably with the experimental results.
