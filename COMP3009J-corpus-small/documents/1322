qualitiative solutions of the stability equation for a boundary layer in contact with various forms of flexible surface. an appropriate form of the boundary layer stability equation is developed for the condition where the fluid is in contact with an isotropic and homogeneous elastic medium, and various approximate analytical solutions obtained for certain types of surface, so as to reveal at least qualitatively the origin and characteristics of neutral oscillations. in the worked solutions the elastic medium is treated as nondissipative, and the interior boundary is supposed either fixed, or free of stress, or exposed to fluid.. the boundary layer, also, is treated as that over a flat-plate in an incompressible fluid. the results obtained show that the presence of such a resiliant surface introduces the possibility of a number of other modes of oscillation schlichting waves. most of these modes have speeds of propagation determined largely by the properties of the elastic material, and their presence may well be effectively a matter of 'non-viscous' flow stability -dash a subject not treated here. the tollmien-schlichting mode has its minimum reynolds number increased by the presence of the surface, but if the interior boundary is free there may be an upper limit as well. indeed, a sufficiently thin free surface, or one of low rigidity, apparently eliminates neutral oscillations of this mode altogether, only at the expense, however, of the introduction of a mode of flexural waves.
