buckling of ring-stiffened cylinders under a pure bending moment and a nonuniform temperature distribution. thirteen stainless-steel ring-stiffened cylinders were subjected to a pure bending load and heated rapidly until buckling occurred. for most of the cylinders the heating was not uniform around the circumference so that appreciable axial thermal stresses were present. elementary thermal stress theory was found to be inadequate for the prediction of these thermal stresses, but a method was developed that would give satisfactory thermal stress results. by properly accounting for the thermal stress, the buckling load could be correlated with a theory for the buckling of an axially compressed ring-stiffened cylinder that is uniformly heated.
