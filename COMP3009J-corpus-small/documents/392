natural frequencies of rectangular plates with edges elastically restrained against rotation. plates with attachments to heavier members along the edges can be described as having edges elastically restrained against rotation, in many cases uniformly along each edge. at the edges, setting slope, when is the edge bending moment with always positive, the elastic restraint can be analytically defined with describing respectively, clamped and simply supported edges. in this note natural frequencies of such plates are calculated mainly following the nomenclature of dana young.
