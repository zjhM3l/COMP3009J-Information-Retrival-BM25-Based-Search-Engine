aerodynamic characteristics of a circular cylinder at mach number of 6. 86 and angles of attack up to 90. pressure-distribution and force tests of a circular cylinder have been made in the langley 11-inch hypersonic tunnel at a mach number of based on diameter, and angles of attack up to 90. the results are compared with the hypersonic approximation of grimminger, williams, and young and with a simple modification of the newtonian flow theory. the comparison of experimental results shows that either theory gives adequate general aerodynamic characteristics but that the modified newtonian theory gives a more accurate prediction of the pressure distribution. the calculated crossflow drag coefficients plotted as a function of crossflow mach number were found to be in reasonable agreement with similar results obtained from other investigations at lower supersonic mach numbers. comparison of the results of this investigation with data obtained at a lower mach number indicates that the drag coefficient of a cylinder normal to the flow is relatively constant for mach numbers above about 4.
