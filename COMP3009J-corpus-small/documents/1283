on shearing flow between porous coaxial cylinders. the flow between concentric porous cylinders in relative axial motion with a pressure gradient is considered. the analysis is restricted by the assumption that the velocity distribution is a function of the radial coordinate only so that there is no net injection or withdrawal of fluid at any station. this assumption reduces the problem to a soluble system of ordinary differential equations. an associated heat-transfer problem is also discussed briefly.
