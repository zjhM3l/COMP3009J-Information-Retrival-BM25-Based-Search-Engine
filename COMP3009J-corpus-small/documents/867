low frequency fatigue of nimonic 90. low frequency fatigue - a rheological approach. an alloy of nimonic 90 type has been tested under cyclic loads at temperatures of 800 deg., 850 deg. and 900 deg. cent. graham's descriptive theory of deformation has been developed in detail for the tests reported here, and shown to provide a satisfactory description of the experimental results. the variation of cumulative strain with number of cycles can be described by the sum of powers of cycle number, n, n, n, and n. there is qualitative agreement between the observed and the calculated stress-strain loops. the effect of variation of maximum stress per cycle can be described by the sum of power terms with simple exponents. within the scatter of observation, the total time to fracture is independent of the frequency.
