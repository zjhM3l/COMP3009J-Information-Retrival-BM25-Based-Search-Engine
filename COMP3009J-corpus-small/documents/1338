investigation to determine effects of center of gravity location on the transonic flutter characteristics of a 45degree sweptback wing. an experimental investigation has been conducted in the 26-inch langley transonic blowdown tunnel to determine effects of center-of-gravity location on the transonic flutter characteristics of a 45degree swept-back-wing plan form of aspect ratio 4.0 and taper ratio 0.6. solid-construction models of the plan form with streamwise naca 65a004 airfoil sections and center-of-gravity locations at approximately 34 percent chord, 46 percent chord, and 58 percent chord, respectively, were fluttered at several mach numbers between 0.8 and 1.35. it was found that, for streamwise mach numbers from 0.8 to 1.0, the variation with mach number of the ratio of experimental flutter speed to a calculated incompressible flutter speed was not affected by center-of-gravity location. however, for mach numbers from 1.0 to 1.35, there was an increase in flutter-speed ratio with mach number which was different for each center-of-gravity position. data from wings with successively more forward center-of-gravity locations showed successively larger values of flutter-speed ratio at mach numbers from 1.0 to
