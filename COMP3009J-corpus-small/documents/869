the calculation of transient temperature in turbine blades and tapered discs using biot's variational method. transient temperatures in aerofoil sections and tapered discs are calculated taking advantage of simplifications in heat flow analysis achieved in biot's variational method. cross-sections are represented by a line of adjacent squares of various sizes suitable for the local dimensions, e.g. small squares near the leading and trailing edges. the potential, dissipation and surface dissipation functions of biot's method are set up, and the lagrange equations lead, by automatic procedures, to an eigenvalue formulation in matrix form for the temperatures and their first time derivatives. solutions are sums of exponentials in time, and are evaluated by digital computer, requiring about five minutes for each cross-section and heat transfer coefficient. transient temperatures in a particular aerofoil section for variation of heat transfer coefficient and for external temperature depending exponentially on time agree with results obtained on an analogue computer. maximum transient temperature differences are evaluated for tapered discs by a simple electrical analogue) with variation of edge radius and heat transfer coefficient. peculiarities in the solution for cyclic temperature external to an aerofoil over a range of frequencies indicate limitations in the mathematical formulation. a successful solution for cyclic external temperature might enable eigenvalues to be separated out in experimental measurements using electronic equipment, and this might be extended to exponential external temperature if a relationship between cyclic and exponential external temperature could be established. eigenvalues and eigenvectors as discrete values arise fictitiously from the sub-division into squares and the possibility of an integral formulation is mentioned. there is a possible, but not immediate, extension to cooled blades, whose cross-sections are multiply-connected regions. transient stresses due to creep, and viscoelasticity might be included.
