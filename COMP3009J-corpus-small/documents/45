an investigation of separated flows, part ii: flow in the cavity and heat transfer. the first portion of this paper describes studies of the internal structure of the separated flow in a notch at a free-stream mach number of 3. observations include.. flow visualization, spark- schlieren pictures of the fluctuations of the free shear layer, and studies of the diffusion of heat from sources placed in the separated region. the second part describes measurements of local heat transfer to the wall. the external mach number, the length-to-depth ratio of the cavity, the ratio of the oncoming boundary layer thickness to the notch depth (in the turbulent flow region), the thermal to-momentum thickness ratio of the boundary layer and, finally, the geometry of the internal boundary of the separated region are varied as systematically as possible. on the basis of these observations, a simple model of the flow in and the heat transfer across the separated region is formulated.
