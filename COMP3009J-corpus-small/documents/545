calculation of sideslip derivatives and pressure distribution in asymmetric flight conditions on a slender wing-fin configuration. the flow around slender wing-fin configurations having curved leading edges, whose shape is defined by polynomials, is considered. a general expression for the pressure distribution on such a configuration in asymmetric flow is derived and the derivatives due to the particular case of sideslipping motion are also given. no numerical results are given for wing-fin load distribution, but the sideslip derivatives have been evaluated in a number of cases for gothic and ogee wings.
