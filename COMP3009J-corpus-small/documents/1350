effects of jet billowing on stability of missile-type bodies at mach 3. 85. the interference effects of a billowing jet on the forces and moments of two missile-type bodies were investigated in the nasa lewis 2-by 2-foot mach 3.85 wind tunnel. to simulate a rocket jet, pressurized nitrogen was exhausted from an annular sonic nozzle. the results indicate that for both models the stability parameter moment coefficient with angle of attack) in the region of zero angle of attack was favorably influenced by the interference resulting from separation due to jet billowing. schlieren photographs are presented that show the separation due to the jet billowing at various pressure ratios and angles of attack.
