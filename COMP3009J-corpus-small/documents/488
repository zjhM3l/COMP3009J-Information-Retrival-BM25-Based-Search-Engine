a reaction-rate parameter for gasdynamics of a chemically reacting gas mixture. presented note proposes a linearized reaction rate parameter which is applicable to any reacting gas mixture provided all the pertinent reactions and their rate constants are known at the thermodynamic conditions under consideration. linearizing is achieved by expanding equation of rate of chemical reaction in a taylor series and neglecting higher-order terms. author announces that tables of linearized reaction rate parameters for dissociated and slightly ionized air are now in preparation at the space sciences laboratory, general electric co., msvo. comparison of preliminary results with exact calculations published by hall, i. g., et.al., /inviscid hypersonic air-flows with coupled non-equilibrium processes/ (ias paper 62-67, 30th annual meeting, new york, jan. 1962) indicates good agreement.
