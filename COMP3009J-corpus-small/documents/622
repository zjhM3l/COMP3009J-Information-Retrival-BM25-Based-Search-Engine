scale height in the upper atmosphere, derived from changes in satellite orbits. the'density scale height'h in the upper atmosphere is a measure of the rate at which air density p varies with height y, being given by h-p//dp/dy/. the value of h, although important because/with the molecular weight of the air/it determines the air temperature, has not as yet been well determined at heights above 200 km. this note develops methods for finding h from the decrease in a satellite's perigee height and from the decrease in the orbital period of a satellite in a small-eccentricity orbit. these methods are then applied to all the 14 satellites found suitable for the purpose. the 44 values of h obtained, for heights of 200-450 km, represent an average over day and night and probably have errors/s.d./of 5-10(. it is found that, as solar activity declined between 1957 and 1961, h decreased greatly..e.g.at height 275 km, h decreased from 60 km in early 1958 to height becomes much less rapid above 350 km, and are consistent with the supposition that h had low values, near 35 km, at heights near 250 km, for 1959-61. the results could be greatly extended in scope and improved in accuracy if more accurate orbits were available for short-lifetime satellites.
