the effect of adverse pressure gradients on the characteristics of turbulent boundary layers in supersonic streams. tests were conducted at mach numbers from 2.0 to 3.5 to determine the thickness and profile shape characteristics of turbulent boundary layers on two-dimensional and axisymmetric curved-surface models having adverse pressure gradients. the magnitude of the gradients relative to the boundary-layer thickness at the beginning of the gradient was varied by employing models having different radii of curvature and by changing the boundary-layer thickness at the beginning of the gradient. the overall pressure rise in most cases was greater than the value which would cause a turbulent boundary layer to separate if the pressure rise were created by an oblique shock wave. an analytical investigation was also conducted so that the results of the experimental investigation could be applied to the prediction of cases outside the range of the experiments. it is shown that boundary-layer momentum thickness can be predicted from the von karman boundary-layer momentum equation, but that measured values of boundary-layer profile shape are in poor agreement with values computed from procedures derived by extending conventional methods for predicting profile shape in subsonic flow. a new procedure for calculating boundary-layer profile shapes, developed in this paper, is shown to provide a good correlation between experimental and calculated values of boundary-layer profile shapes in adverse pressure gradients created by curved surfaces. this procedure is based on the experimental observation that the station at which high-energy free-stream flow actually mixes into a turbulent boundary layer in an adverse pressure gradient is well downstream of the station at which flow would have to mix in order to maintain a flat-plate profile.
