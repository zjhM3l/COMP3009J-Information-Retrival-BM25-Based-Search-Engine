the development of the boundary layer in supersonic shear flow. the development of the boundary layer in a velocity shear layer is discussed for two-dimensional flow and for axisymmetric flow of both compressible and incompressible fluids. it is shown that the solutions obtained by li and glauert for the two-dimensional flow of an incompressible fluid are applicable in the more general case after suitable transformations of coordinates have been made. new definitions are shown to be necessary, and are given, for the displacement and momentum thicknesses of such a boundary layer. reynolds numbers based on these thicknesses are given, and it is shown that any phenomenon which occurs at a constant value of such a reynolds number will occur at a point which, as the length scale of the flow increases, first moves down-stream and then moves slightly upstream. this is shown to be in qualitative agreement with experimental results on a blunt cone in a supersonic flow. a quantitative comparison of the theoretical and experimental values of displacement and momentum thicknesses is attempted, and no disagreement is obvious,. unfortunately the accuracy of the experiments so far available is insufficient to give positive confirmation of the theory of this note.
