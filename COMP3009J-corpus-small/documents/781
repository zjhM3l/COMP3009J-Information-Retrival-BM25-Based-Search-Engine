use of subsonic kernel function in an influence-coefficient method of aeroelastic analysis and some comparisons with experiment. this paper illustrates the development and application of an influence-coefficient method of analysis for calculating the response of a flexible wing in an airstream to an oscillating disturbing force and for treating such aeroelastic instabilities as flutter and divergence. aerodynamic coefficients are derived on the basis of lifting-surface theory for subsonic compressible flow by use of the method presented in nasa technical report r-48. application of the analysis is made to a uniform cantilever wing-tip tank configuration for which responses to a sinusoidal disturbing force and flutter speeds were measured over a range of subsonic mach numbers and densities. calculated responses and flutter speeds based on flexibility influence coefficients measured at nine stations are in good agreement with experiment, provided the aerodynamic load is distributed over the wing so that local centers of pressure very nearly coincide with these nine influence stations. the use of experimental values of bending and torsional structural damping coefficients in the analysis generally improved the agreement between calculated and experimental responses. some calculations were made to study the effects of density on responses near the flutter conditions, and linear response trends were obtained over a wide range of densities.
