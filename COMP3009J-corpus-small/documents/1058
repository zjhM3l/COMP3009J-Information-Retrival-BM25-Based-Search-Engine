the conical disk spring. this paper presents approximate formulas to describe the behavior of the conical disk spring. it is assumed that the shallow conical shell remains conical when subjected to the axially symmetric edge loads. the principle of stationary potential energy is used to derive the relations between load and deflection. formulas relating the applied loads, stresses, and deflections are given for several types of edge constraint. the analysis is essentially a refinement and extension of the previous work of almen and laszlo.
