simple shear flow past a flat plate in an incompressible fluid of small viscosity. in the study of high-speed viscous flow past a two-dimensional body it is usually necessary to consider a curved shock wave emitting from the nose or leading edge of the body. consequently, there exists an inviscid rotational flow region between the shock wave and the boundary layer. such a situation arises, for instance, in the study of the hypersonic viscous flow past a flat plate. the situation is somewhat different from prandtl's classical boundary-layer problem. in prandtl's original problem the inviscid free stream outside the boundary layer is irrotational while in a hypersonic boundary-layer problem the inviscid free stream must be considered as rotational. the possible effects of vorticity have been recently discussed by ferri and libby. in the present paper, the simple shear flow past a flat plate in a fluid of small viscosity is investigated. it can be shown that this problem can again be treated by the boundary-layer approximation, the only novel feature being that the free stream has a constant vorticity. the discussion here is restricted to two-dimensional incompressible steady flow.
