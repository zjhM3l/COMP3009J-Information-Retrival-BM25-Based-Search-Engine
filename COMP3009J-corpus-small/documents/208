the hall effect in the viscous flow of ionized gas between parallel plates under transverse magnetic field. the electrical conductivity of an ionized gas is anisotropic in the presence of magnetic field (hall effect). the conductivity is expressed by a tensor in the same form for both fully and partially ionized gases. by the use of modified ohm's law and conventional magnetohydrodynamical equations the incompressible viscous flow between parallel plates under the transverse magnetic field is analyzed and an exact solution is obtained when the magnetic reynolds number is small. the numerical results reveal a remarkable effect of anisotropy of conductivity. the acceleration and deceleration of viscous ionized gas under combined electric and magnetic fields are also calculated.
