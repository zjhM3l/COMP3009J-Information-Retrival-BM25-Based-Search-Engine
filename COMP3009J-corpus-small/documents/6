one-dimensional transient heat flow in a multilayer slab. in a recent contribution to the readers' forum wassermann gave analytic solutions for the temperature in a double layer slab, with a triangular heat rate input at one face, insulated at the other, and with no thermal resistance at the interface. his solutions were for the three particular cases.. i propose here to give the general solution to this problem, to indicate briefly how it is obtained using the method of reference 2, and to point out that the solutions given by wassermann are incomplete for times longer than the duration of the heat input.
