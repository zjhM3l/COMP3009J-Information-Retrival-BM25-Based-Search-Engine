radiative heat transfer during atmosphere entry at parabolic velocity. stagnation point radiative heating rates for manned vehicles entering the earth's atmosphere at parabolic velocity are presented and compared with corresponding laminar convective heating rates. the calculations were made for both nonlifting and lifting entry trajectories for vehicles of varying nose radius, weight-to-area ratio, and drag. it is concluded from the results presented that radiative heating will be important for the entry conditions considered.
