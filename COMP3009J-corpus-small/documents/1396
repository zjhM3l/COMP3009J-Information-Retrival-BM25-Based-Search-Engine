shear buckling of clamped and simply-supported infinitely long plates reinforced by transverse stiffeners. the paper presents a solution to the buckling of infinitely long plates clamped along the edges, together with an extension of the solution obtained by stein and fralich for the case when the edges are simply-supported. it is shown that, as a consequence of increasing the edge support from that of a simple support to one in which both deflection and rotation are prevented, the rigidity which an intermediate transverse stiffener must possess in order to support the plate effectively is much reduced. agreement between the theoretical relationships and existing experimental data is good.
