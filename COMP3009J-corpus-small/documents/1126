an engineer's conceptual approach to the buckling of cylindrical shell (axial loading). by using the well known analogy between the bending of a beam on an elastic foundation and the axial symmetric displacement of a cylinder, a physical insight is obtained for the buckling of cylindrical shells under axial compression. the technique is equivalent to classical small deflection theory and provides good agreement with the more elaborate solutions for the buckling strength of various sandwich, multi-layered, and orthotropic cylinders, including the effects of internal pressure or an elastic core.
