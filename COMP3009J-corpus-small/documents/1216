pressure distribution in regions of step-induced turbulent separation. an analysis is made of the pressure distribution in the separated-flow region ahead of a step, using the concept of the turbulent mixing coefficient of crocco and lees and the /jet-flow/ model of chapman with some modification. on the basis of a variable mixing coefficient, a differential equation for the pressure distribution is derived, which gives the pressure rise as a function of the distance from the separation point. this equation contains the separation length as an unknown. a second equation is obtained by making a mass balance of the air entering and, leaving the /dead-air/ region ahead of the step. the pressure rise and the separation distance for a given mach number are determined by solving the two equations simultaneously. the analysis yields results which are in close agreement with the experimental data on steps, obtained at princeton, particularly for m = 3.85. for lower mach numbers, a maximum variation of 5 percent is found between theory and experiment. use of the velocity profiles of jets, as required by the jet-flow model, necessarily restricts the applicability of the present study to flows with thin boundary layers at the separation point.
