experimental investigation of attenuation of strong shock waves in a shock tube with hydrogen and helium as driver gases. an experimental investigation has been made of the attenuation of strong shock waves in air in a shock tube. time-history measurements were made of the static pressure at several stations in the wall of the tube. the internal diameter of the tube is 3.75 inches. shock- wave-velocity data were taken for a distance along the tube of about 120 feet. the range of the shock-wave mach number covered was from 5 to 10 and the initial pressure ahead of the shock wave varied from 5 to 100 millimeters of mercury. hydrogen and helium were used as driver gases. a helium-driven shock wave was found to decay only about one-half as rapidly as a hydrogen-driven shock wave. the pressure level had little effect on the attenuation rate of a shock wave of given strength for the pressure range investigated. the static-pressure measurements indicated that a severe pressure gradient existed in the latter portion of the air flow. this gradient limits the testing time useful for obtaining reliable aerodynamic data.
