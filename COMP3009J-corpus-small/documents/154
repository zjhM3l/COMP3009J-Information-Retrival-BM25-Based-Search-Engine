velocity and temperature distributions in the turbulent wake behind a heated body of revolution. recently (see abstract 954 (1938)) goldstein made calculations based on theories of vorticity transfer, of the distributions of velocity and temperature in the turbulent wake behind a heated body of revolution, and the present authors now record an experimental determination of these distributions in a low-turbulence wind tunnel. difficulty was experienced in obtaining a truly symmetrical wake and observations have been reduced to mean values, curves of which are given.
