determination of lift or drag programs to minimize re-entry heating. a study of single-pass re-entry from escape speed and from circular satellite speed is made to determine the lift program for a hypersonic glider and the drag-modulation program for a non-lifting vehicle that minimize the heating of the vehicles within acceleration or range constraints. a new method of numerical solution is used, similar to kelley's /method of gradients,/ that permits rapid convergence to the optimum lift program starting with an original good estimate. this method avoids the two-point boundary-value problem of the calculus-of-variations formulation, and is applicable to any optimum-programing problem. an acceleration-tolerance limit is introduced which describes the human pilot's capability to withstand acceleration more accurately than a simple acceleration limit.
