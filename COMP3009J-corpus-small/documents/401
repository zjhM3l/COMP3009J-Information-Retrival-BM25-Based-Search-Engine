inviscid hypersonic airflows with coupled non-equilibrium processes. analyses have been made of the effects of coupled chemical rate processes in external inviscid hypersonic airflows at high enthalpy levels. exact (numerical) solutions have been obtained by the inverse method for inviscid airflow over a near-spherical nose under flight conditions where substantial nonequilibrium prevails through the nose region. typical conditions considered include nose radii of the order of 1 ft at an altitude of 250,000 ft and velocities of 15,000 and 23,000 ft per sec. the results illustrate the general importance of the coupling among the reactions considered. these included dissociation-recombination, bimolecular-exchange, and ionization reactions. the exact solutions show the bimolecular, no exchange reactions to be important in blunt-nose flow for the kinetics of no and n, as they are in the case of a plane shock wave. an important difference between blunt-nose flow and plane shock flow, however, is the gasdynamic expansion in the curved shock layer of the former. this expansion reduces post-shock reaction rates. as a consequence, in the regime studied the oxygen and nitrogen-atom concentrations tend to freeze in the nose region at levels below those for infinite-rate equilibrium. the reduction below the equilibrium dissociation level can be large, particularly for nitrogen dissociation at higher velocities. in the regime considered, the chemical kinetics are dominated by two-body collision processes. the inviscid nose flow, including coupled nonequilibrium phenomena, is thus amenable to binary scaling for a given velocity. the binary scaling is demonstrated for a range of altitude and scale by correlation of the exact solutions for given velocity and a constant product of ambient density and nose radius. this similitude, which can also scale viscous nonequilibrium and radiation phenomena in the shock layer, provides a useful flexibility for hypersonic testing where it is applicable. the afterbody inviscid-flow problem is briefly discussed in the light of the results for the nose flow.
