on the low aspect ratio oscillating rectangular wing in supersonic flow. the laplace transform of the lift distribution on an oscillating rectangular wing in a supersonic flow is obtained by separating the linearised equation for the velocity potential in elliptic (cylindrical) co-ordinates. the results for the case of no spanwise distortion are expanded in ascending powers of the aspect ratio in order to compare with the slender body theory, and the longitudinal stability derivatives are calculated. it is found that at either supersonic or transonic speeds single-degree- of-freedom instability in pitch is impossible insofar as the fourth power of the aspect ratio is neglected.
