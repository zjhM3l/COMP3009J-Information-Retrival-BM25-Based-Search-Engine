plastic stability theory of geometrically orthotropic plates and cylindrical shells. a linear eighth-order equilibrium differential equation for plastic buckling of geometrically orthotropic thin cylindrical shells is derived. this equation is used to obtain explicit solutions for long flat plates and wide columns under axial compression and moderate-length cylinders under external pressure, torsion, and axial compression.
