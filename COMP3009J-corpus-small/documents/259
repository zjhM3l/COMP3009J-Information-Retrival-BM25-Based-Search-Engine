second order theory for unsteady supersonic flow past slender pointed bodies of revolution. the thermodynamic properties (z = pv rt, e rt, h rt, s r, and pressure) are given for equilibrium mixtures of dissociated and ionized molecules and atoms of the elements nitrogen and oxygen having the low temperature composition of.78847 n and.21153 o. the tabulated properties of this mixture (a close approximation to the properties of air) are given at close intervals from 2000 to and 10 times the normal density. the results are based on chemical equilibria between the species o, o, n, n, no, no, no, no, o, o, o, o, n, n, n and electrons. the method of presentation permits later corrections for the effect of argon and co and the contribution of intermolecular forces. the calculations are based on 9.758 e.v. as the dissociation energy of molecular nitrogen and 1.45 e.v. as the electron affinity of atomic oxygen.
