investigation of a retrocket exhausting from the nose of a blunt body into a supersonic free stream. the pressure distribution and pressure drag of a blunt body with a supersonic jet issuing upstream from its center were determined at free-stream mach numbers of 1.60, 2.00, and 2.85. the thrust of the jet issuing from the model nose was varied to study its effects on flow around the model and to determine variation of pressure distribution and pressure drag of the model with the thrust. at all mach numbers investigated, the pressure drag decreased with increasing retrorocket thrust until a minimum value was reached. further increases in retrorocket thrust resulted in increases in the pressure drag. the resultant drag /pressure drag plus retrorocket thrust but excluding base and skin-friction drag/ of the model was reduced by retrorocket operation below the drag for a jet-off condition, except at very low retrorocket thrust coefficients. the flow about the nose of the blunt body was very unstable throughout the range of mach numbers and retrorocket thrust coefficients investigated.
