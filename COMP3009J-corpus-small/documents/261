experiments on axi-symmetric boundary layers along a long cylinder in incompressible flow. experiments on axi-symmetric boundary layers along a long cylinder were made especially to investigate the effect of transverse curvature on the velocity profile. laminar velocity profiles were measured and compared with theoretical ones with good accuracy. a representative profile was plotted to see the effect of transverse curvature, which showed small, but obvious effect accompanied by increasing skin friction. the transition of the flow from laminar to turbulent was observed, and its reynolds number was estimated to occur at 1.2 1.8x10 in the present experiment. the turbulent profile was also measured and plotted by using the coordinates to express the wall law deduced by richmond, from which it was estimated that, as the ratio of the momentum thickness to body radius increases, the profile near the outer layer tends to bend down relative to the line of logarithmic wall law.
