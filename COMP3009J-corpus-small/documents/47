analysis of low-aspect-ratio aircraft structures. two methods are presented for the analysis of complex low- aspect-ratio aircraft structures. both methods provide for arbitrary external loading, are general with respect to the orientation of structural members, and permit arbitrary boundary conditions. for purposes of analysis a structure is idealized as a network of flexural members with interconnected torsion boxes. in the first method, sets of linear equations are obtained by expressing boundary conditions, member deflection equations, equilibrium requirements, and slope-compatibility relationships in terms of deflections and internal forces. the solution for deflections and internal forces is then formed as the product of an inverse structural matrix and a column matrix of load functions. in the second method, the conditions at a given boundary are assembled as a column matrix and are transferred in a step by-step fashion over the entire structure to an opposite boundary. the transfer is accomplished by successive multiplications of square matrices composed independently for the different transfer ranges. the final operation is the inversion of a relatively small matrix and provides the solution for the unknown boundary conditions. comparisons of theoretical results with experimental data and electric-analog solutions are favorable.
