inelastic behaviour of structures subjected to cyclic thermal and mechanical stressing conditions. a general analytical procedure is outlined for structures subjected to varying thermal and mechanical stressing conditions. consideration is given to the accumulation of time-independent plastic strains and creep strains. stress-strain-temperature-time relations for uniaxial and multiaxial stresses are defined, based on various material behavior assumptions. several of the assumptions are compared with a limited number of time-varying temperature and uniaxial stress tests. the procedure is illustrated by its application to uniaxial stress problems in which /planes originally plane remain plane/ and to plane stress plate problems. a solution, based on the influence coefficient approach to the plane stress plate problem, is obtained which is applicable to all plate plan forms, edge boundary conditions, and inplane thermal and mechanical loading conditions. from the predicted inelastic behavior of a three-bar structure subjected to cyclic thermal and mechanical loading conditions, it is shown that eventual failure could result from large permanent deformation accumulations, tensile rupture, or thermal-stress-fatigue. a sample plate with a centrally located hole was analyzed for two cycles of a time-varying temperature and edge stress condition. both plastic strain reversals and plastic strain growths were predicted at the hole. however, a test-theory comparison indicated failure by creep-rupture.
