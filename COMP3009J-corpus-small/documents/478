tabulation of the blasius function with blowing and suction. authors tabulate solutions of f''' + ff'' = 0 for the velocity distribution in a boundary layer. for each solution f'(0) = 0, the third boundary condition is the specification of f(0). f(n) and its first three derivatives are tabulated to 5d in gaps of 0.1 in n for f(0) = -1.23849, -1.2(0.05) 0.5 (0.1) 1.5, introduction gives method of solution and physical meaning of boundary conditions, etc. lock's (amr cussed.
