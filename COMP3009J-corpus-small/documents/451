liapunov's methods in automatic control theory. the work of a. m. liapunov and his theory of stability is discussed. the second method of liapunov is shown to have applications for linear equations with real constant coefficients, for a proof of the routh-hurwitz criterion, and linear equations with periodic coefficients. practical examples include non-linear stability problems of control, and the functions have uses in other areas of control systems.
