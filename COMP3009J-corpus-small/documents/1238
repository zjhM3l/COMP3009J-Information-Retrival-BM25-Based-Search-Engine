the newtonian approximation in magnetic hypersonic stagnation-point flow. the hypersonic flow of an electrically conducting fluid around the stagnation region of a sphere carrying a radial magnetic field is examined. by assuming a newtonian pressure distribution and constant density, the differential equation of the inviscid flow is integrated and a simple closed-form solution is obtained. it is found that the ratio of the stand-off distances of the shock wave for the magnetic and nonmagnetic cases does not depend explicitly on the magnetic parameter s (ratio of the ponderomotive force to the free-stream inertia force) nor on the density ratio (the value at the free stream divided by the value behind the shock wave) but on the product s at least for values of between and. the velocity gradient on the body is also calculated and the ratio of the magnetic to the nonmagnetic case is shown to depend on the parameter. the case of cylindrical shocks is also examined,. the same general conclusions are drawn.
