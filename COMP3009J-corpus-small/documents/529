some effects of injection of foreign gases in a decelerating laminar boundary layer in supersonic flow. the purpose of this research program was to investigate the effects of a diffusion field on a laminar boundary layer in a supersonic flow. specifically, helium, nitrogen, and argon were uniformly injected into the laminar boundary layer of a high-speed flow in a tube with the objective of determining the effects of such injection on the pressure, temperature, and recovery factor distribution along and downstream of the injection region. a continuously operating axially-symmetric wind tunnel has been designed, constructed, and operated. this tunnel consists of an air supply system, a flowmeter, an upstream stagnation tank, a supersonic nozzle (throat diameter 0.262 and exit diameter 1.400), a test section of variable length (zero to 81 diameters, test section diameter of 1.400), a downstream stagnation tank, an exhaust system, a foreign gas supply system, and all necessary instrumentation. the overall performance of this apparatus in terms of the design specifications was excellent. the tunnel was instrumented with 109 thermocouples. all temperatures except ambient temperatures were automatically measured and recorded by means of a self-balancing recording potentiometer. there was 29 pressure taps distributed along the tunnel, 23 along the test section itself. pressures were measured by means of an interconnected micromanometer and a vacuum referenced manometer system with overlapping ranges. for all of the results reported herein, the overall test section was 41 diameters in length,. composed of a porous test section approximately 7.2 diameters in length (leading edge approximately 1.8 diameters from the nozzle exit plane) and four nylon test sections of 8 diameters each.
