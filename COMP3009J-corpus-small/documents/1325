experiments on the use of suction through perforated strips for maintaining laminar flow. transition and drag measurements. wind-tunnel tests are described in which suction is applied at perforated strips, as an alternative to porous strips or slots, in order to maintain a laminar boundary layer. a test was first carried out on a single row of perforations on a cambered plate, as a preliminary to the main tests which were performed on strips of multiple rows of perforations drilled through the surface of a low-drag-type aerofoil 13 per cent thick and of 5-ft chord. up to a wind speed of 180 ft sec it has been ascertained that suction may be safely applied to extend laminar flow provided the ratio of hole diameter to boundary-layer displacement thickness is less than 2, the ratio of hole pitch to diameter is less than 3 and there are at least three rows of holes in the strip. with less than three rows, the criteria are much more restrictive. it is possible to extend laminar flow by suction through perforations whose diameters and pitches exceed these values slightly, but only with the risk that excessive suction quantities will produce wedges of turbulent boundary layer originating at the holes. a uniform distribution of suction through the holes was necessary. this was successfully obtained by two methods, the use of cells and throttle holes, and with tapered holes. in particular, tests were carried out on some panels supplied by handley page, ltd., in which the cells and tapered holes had been constructed by commercial methods, and the suction distribution proved satisfactory. the resistance of some of the cellular arrangements was measured. it was found that when the suction quantities were the minimum required to maintain laminar flow, the additional losses in total head of the sucked air due to the resistance of the throttle holes could be made small compared with the loss in total head of the sucked boundary layer.
