on the coupling between heat and mass transfer. in mixtures of two different gases or liquids, one constituent will migrate spontaneously toward the warmer parts, and the other toward the colder parts. this phenomenon, known as the soret effect, and its converse the dufour effect, were discovered as early as 1856 and 1873 respectively. the two effects can also be considered as a simultaneous transport of mass and heat, or as a coupling between heat and mass transfer. the effects of this coupling have been neglected in all investigations of heat transfer in multicomponent flow systems so far, on the a priori assumption that they are small. in a recent publication however, it was shown that they can be large in laminar-boundary-layer-type flows with helium injection. turbulent-boundary-layer measurements and an analysis conducted at the heat transfer laboratory clearly showed significant effects of the coupling on heat transfer and adiabatic wall temperature. from additional measurements, the results of which are presented below, it is possible to separate the heat flux at the model wall into one part depending on the temperature gradient and a second part caused by the coupling. it is shown that the latter exceeds the former, and hence the coupling may not be neglected a priori without careful consideration.
