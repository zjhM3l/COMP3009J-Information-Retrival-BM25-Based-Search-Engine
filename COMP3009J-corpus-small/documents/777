a technique for rendering approximate solutions to physical problems uniformly valid. a method is described for treating some of the characteristically non-linear problems of physics, in particular those involving a non-linear partial differential equation for which an approximate linearization is permissible everywhere except in a limited region, such as the neighbourhood of (5) a singular characteristic of the approximate solution, or of approximation is valueless. the method involves a transformation of an independent variable, which is determined progressively with successive approximations to the solution.. only one step being necessary if a first approximation valid uniformly be obtained. the method is most easily understood in its application to simple first order ordinary differential equations, which are studied in detail in 2 and 3 as a preparation for the extension to more complicated problems in 4, 5 and 6. physically, the longest section, 6, concerns the /spread/ of a progressive wave at infinity, an important and essentially non-linear process.
