a linearized analysis of the forces exerted on a rigid wing by a shock wave. solutions are obtained in closed form for the pressures exerted on a rigid half plane by an incident, plane acoustic shock wave. the angle of incidence of the wave front is arbitrary and the half plane is considered to be traveling at constant velocity, subsonic of supersonic with respect to the acoustic medium. a closed-form solution is obtained also for a rigid wedge which is motionless with respect to the acoustic medium. the analysis is carried out by transforming the wave equation to laplace's equation by the busemann conical transformation and then applying conformal mapping.
