one dimensional flows of an imperfect diatomic gas. with the assumptions that berthelot's equation of state accounts for molecular size and intermolecular force effects, and that changes in the vibrational heat capacities are given by a planck term, expressions are developed for analyzing one-dimensional flows of a diatomic gas. the special cases of flow through normal and oblique shocks in free air at sea level are investigated. it is found that up to a mach number of 10 the pressure ratio across a normal shock differs by less than 6 percent from its ideal gas value,. whereas at mach numbers above 4 the temperature rise is considerably below and hence the density rise is well above that predicted assuming ideal gas behavior. it is further shown that only the caloric imperfection in air has an appreciable effect on the pressures developed in the shock process considered. the effects of gaseous imperfections on oblique shock flows are studied from the standpoint of their influence on the lift and pressure drag of a flat plate operating at mach numbers of 10 and 20. the influence is found to be small.
