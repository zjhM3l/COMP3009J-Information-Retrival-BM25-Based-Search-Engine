on the bending of a clamped plate. the present paper contains an application of a recently developed variational method to the boundary value problem of the bending of a clamped plate of arbitrary shape. it will be shown that this problem can be linked to the simpler problem of the equilibrium of a membrane by a chain of intermediate problems, which can be solved explicitly and in finite form in terms of the membrane problem. in the intermediate problems, the deflection converges uniformly in the domain of the plate of the clamped plate, and the derivatives of all orders of the deflection converge uniformly in every domain completely interior to the plate. (in the ritz method, not even the convergence of the slopes can be guaranteed.) the method yields numerical results for plates of all shapes for which the membrane problem (which we shall call the base problem) admits an explicit solution. as an example we shall consider a clamped square plate under a uniform load. this problem has been the object of numerous investigations, some of which are theoretical, while others are purely numerical, use infinite simple and double series, and operate with an infinite number of linear equations and an infinite number of unknowns. an inspection of the general formulae derived in the present paper, formulae which become simple in numerical applications, would show how some of the numerical methods might be rendered rigorous. the convergence of higher derivatives is of great practical interest for the approximate computation of the stresses.
