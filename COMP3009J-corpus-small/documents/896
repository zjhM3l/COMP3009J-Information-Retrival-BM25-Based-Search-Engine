the calculation of loads on a supersonic weapon in the steady circling case. the economy of a design depends on the accuracy with which it is possible to solve the various structural problems as this has a direct bearing on structure weight. this paper describes the calculation of the bending moments on a specific weapon for the high-g steady circling case. a hybrid method is used to obtain the aerodynamic loads. the results presented show the effect of a number of parameters, such as - altitude, weight, acceleration and mach number - on the magnitude of the maximum bending moment.
