free-flight measurements of the zero-lift drag and base pressure on a wind tunnel interference model (m=0. 8 - 1. 5). five free-flight models were flown to measure the zero-lift drag and body base pressure on a standard wind tunnel interference model over a mach number range of 0.84 to 1.48. roughness bands on the wings and body of the model are shown to produce a small but definite increase in the zero-lift drag at all mach numbers. the measured drag is in fair agreement with corresponding measurements made in various transonic tunnels with differences that could plausibly be explained as the effects of tunnel interference. the effect of a simulated wind tunnel support sting is shown to increase the base pressure. the discrepancy between models with and without a sting is greatest at subsonic speeds and progressively decreases with increasing mach number until at m = 1.4 the sting has no effect on base pressure.
