magnetohydrodynamic flow past a thin airfoil. the steady flow of a perfectly conducting magnetohydrodynamic fluid past a thin nonconducting airfoil is studied with the usual model in which the fluid variables obey the lundquist equations linearized about a constant unperturbed flow. /hyperliptic/ flows, in which hyperbolic and elliptic fields are superimposed, are considered. results of grad, mccune and resler, and sears and resler are extended and considered in detail for the case of an arbitrarily inclined unperturbed field. the general solution contains four line singularities along the characteristics through the ends of the body and has two arbitrary constants. by a / generalized kutta-joukowski condition,/ these constants are fixed so that two of the line singularities disappear. specifically, it is required that the solution be locally square integrable. behavior of the exponents of the singularities is investigated by numerical computation and, in limiting cases, analytically. the singular parts of some flows are investigated numerically.
