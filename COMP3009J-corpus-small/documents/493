real-gas laminar boundary layer skin friction and heat transfer. the laminar-boundary-layer equations have been integrated for the case of a flat plate over a wide range of free-stream enthalpies and velocities and over a wide range of enthalpies of the gas at the wall. the range of free-stream velocities extended up to 25,000 ft sec at low free-stream enthalpies, corresponding to local conditions on a slender body traveling at high speeds. at low free-stream velocities, the range of free-stream enthalpies extended up to 400,000 btu slug, corresponding to the local conditions on a blunt body traveling at speeds up to 25,000 ft sec. the gas was assumed to be in thermodynamic equilibrium at each point in the boundary layer and diffusion effects were neglected. the solutions to the boundary-layer equations were carried out on a high-speed digital computing machine, both skin-friction and heat-transfer coefficients being obtained from the computations. before presenting the results, the t' method of rubesin and johnson for computing skin-friction coefficients for the perfect-gas case is reviewed. for the real-gas case, the average temperature, t', is replaced by the average enthalpy, h', and the h' method is then used to compute skin-friction coefficients. these values are in excellent agreement with the computing-machine results. it was found that the recovery factor for the real-gas case can be approximated by, the best results for the cases considered being obtained if a value of pr corresponding to the enthalpy, h', is used. using this recovery factor and reynolds analogy, heat-transfer rates can be computed which, with a few exceptions, are within 5 percent of values obtained from computing-machine results.
