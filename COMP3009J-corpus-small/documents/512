quasi-cylindrical surfaces with prescribed thickness distributions. a formula for the supersonic velocity field in terms of a given surface distribution of sources is applied to points lying in the surface. an equation giving the camber shape of a quasi circular-cylindrical surface in terms of a prescribed thickness distribution is derived and the half ring wing with prescribed thickness distribution is discussed as an example.
