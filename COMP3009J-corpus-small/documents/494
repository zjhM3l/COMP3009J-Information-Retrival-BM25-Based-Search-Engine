axisymmetric viscous flow plast very slender bodies of revolution. axisymmetric viscous flow past unyawed very slender bodies of revolution is treated within the category of the perfect gas. attention is paid especially to the effect of transverse curvature of the body. from the transformed equations, the similarity conditions are deduced, and the parameter characterizing the effect of transverse curvature is obtained. several numerical solutions of similarity equations for hypersonic flows are presented, and upon the basis of these results, the effect of the transverse-curvature parameter is discussed. a method of applying the local-similarity approximation to obtain the approximate solution for nonsimilar cases is described, as are practical applications to incompressible flow past a long cylinder and to hypersonic flow past a very slender cone. comparison with experimental results shows fair agreement with calculations using the local-similarity approximation in the present range of experimental flow conditions.
