duct flow in magnetohydrodynamics. this paper is an extension of the work of hartmann (2) and shercliff transverse magnetic fields -- the simplest class of magnetohydrodynamic problems. we are concerned here mainly with the boundary value problems associated with flow in ducts with conducting walls.
