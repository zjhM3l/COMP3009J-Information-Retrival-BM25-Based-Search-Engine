generalized conical flow fields in supersonic wing theory. linearized, compressible-flow analysis is applied to the study of quasi-conical supersonic wing theory. single-integral equations are derived which relate either the loading to the shape of a lifting surface or the thickness of a symmetrical wing to the pressure distribution for triangular wings with subsonic leading edges. the forms of these equations and their inversions are simplified through the introduction of the finite part and the generalized principal part of an integral. applications of the theory, in the lifting case, include previously known results. in the nonlifting case, it is shown that for a specified pressure distribution the theory does not always predict a unique thickness distribution. this is demonstrated for a triangular plan form having a constant pressure gradient in the stream direction.
