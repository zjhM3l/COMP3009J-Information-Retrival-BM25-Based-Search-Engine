on the prediction of mixed subsonic/supersonic pressure distributions. high-speed wind-tunnel results are analyzed to derive a semiempirical scheme for the prediction of transonic pressure distributions. the supersonic and subsonic parts of the flow are treated separately, and then linked by an empirical shock pressure rise relation. the significance of the empirical results is considered in relation to the physical mechanism of transonic flows. it is also shown that theoretical solutions can be improved by introducing the empirical shock relation.
