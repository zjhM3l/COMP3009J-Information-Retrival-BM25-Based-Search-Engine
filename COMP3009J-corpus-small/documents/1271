theory of supersonic propeller aerodynamics. a supersonic propeller with blades attached to an infinite cylinder as a hub is studied. the forward speed may be subsonic, but the relative speed at each section is supersonic. the lightly loaded blades are represented by a surface distribution of appropriate /modified/ sources in a fashion similar to ordinary supersonic thin-wing theory. these sources are found by approximating the exact potential for a constant-strength compressible source traveling along a helical path. the usual relationship between the source strength and boundary condition is found,. and subsequently the source distribution is given, to the appropriate order, in terms of the blade geometry. tip effects are considered by extending the theory of evvard and krasilshchikova. the present investigation, however, is restricted to those planforms for which no vortex sheet appears off the tip. for points in the tip region, the potential is obtained through the appropriate distribution of /modified/ sources in the upwash region off the tip. by transforming to a curvilinear, nonorthogonal coordinate system coincident with the modified mach lines described by the infinities of the potential, an integral equation for the required source distribution in the upwash region is derived. without having to solve this equation, it is shown that the potential for a point in the tip region can be obtained in terms of an integration of known source distributions over the blade surface only. the case of a twisted flat plate of particular planform is treated, and a sample calculation is made of the pressure distribution at selected radial positions within the noncommunicating portion of the blade, as well as over the entire tip region. though this analysis is carried out explicitly for the supersonic propeller, it could also be extended to calculate various rotary derivatives for highspeed flight vehicles.
