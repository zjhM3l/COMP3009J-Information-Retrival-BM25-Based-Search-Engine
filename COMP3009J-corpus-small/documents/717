motions of a short 10degree blunted cone entering a martian atmosphere at arbitrary angles of attack and arbitrary pitching rates. the dynamic behavior of two probe vehicles entering a martian atmosphere in a passive manner with arbitrary initial angles of attack and pitching rates to 12degree per second has been determined. results for an entry velocity of 21,700 feet per second and an entry angle of -40degree were obtained from machine calculated solutions of the six-degree- of-freedom rigid-body equations of motion using experimental aerodynamic characteristics for the vehicles. one of the vehicles had a flat base and was statically stable in two attitudes /nose forward and base forward/. the other vehicle, derived from the first by adding a conical afterbody, was statically stable in only one attitude /nose forward/. a 10-rpm vehicle spin rate, believed ample for the purpose of distributing solar and aerodynamic heating over the vehicle surface, and model atmospheres encompassing the probable extremes for the planet were also considered. it was found that while the motion of the flat-based vehicle could be oscillatory about either the nose-forward or base-forward stable trim attitudes when aerodynamic heating rates were high, the range of initial angles of attack resulting in base-forward orientation was reduced by more than a factor of 3. when initial pitch rates were increased from body having only nose-forward stability showed that oscillatory angles of attack at maximum heating-rate conditions probably would not exceed about 25degrees although angles of attack when heating rates were 50 percent of maximum could be as high as 40degree. values of these upper bound angles of attack were essentially independent of initial pitch rates for the range considered. furthermore, the envelope of maximum probable angles of attack was increased only slightly when the vehicle was given a 10-rpm spin rate. the relationship between maximum amplitudes of oscillation and heating rates through high heating portions of the trajectories was preserved when model atmospheres believed to encompass the extreme possibilities for mars were used in the calculations
