an integral method for calculation of supersonic laminar boundary layer with heat transfer on yawed cone. an integral method for calculating the three-dimensional boundary layer over the surface of a cone at angle of attack is investigated. the numerical procedure of integration for that method on the basis of a simplifying assumption concerning the boundary layer development along the cone generator is developed and illustrated by applying the method to find the solutions of integral equations for a specific example. the results obtained for the example for the range of circumferential angle of 40 investigated are summarized and given as heat transfer coefficients, coefficients of friction, and other friction parameters. the distribution of heat transfer coefficients checked with available experimental data fairly well.
