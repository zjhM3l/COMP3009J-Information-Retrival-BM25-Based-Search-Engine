principles of creep buckling weight-strength analysis of aircraft structures. the possibility of a gradual instability failure of a column under compressive load has been recognized for some time. marin presented an analysis of creep buckling based on a theory of creep bending, but did not take into account the average stress due to axial loading. the theory also neglected the transient (nonlinear) portion of the creep curve. in efficient column design, the average stress should be relatively high in comparison with the bending stresses,. that is, the column should be as straight as possible and the slenderness ratio should not be too great. under these conditions marin's theory is not directly applicable, although it gives good agreement with tests of columns having large slenderness ratios or large eccentricities.
