the problem of strain accumulation under thermal cycling. parkes and sprague and huang have shown that it is possible for strain growth to occur in a beam structure under temperature-load cycling. the various aspects of this problem as to criteria for convergence and divergence of the strain accumulation can be simply demonstrated by thermal cycling one element of a two-element structure.
