on local flat plate similarity in the hypersonic boundary layer. a study is made of lees' /local flat-plate similarity/ rule for the hypersonic laminar boundary layer. it is shown that this rule is exact under assumptions commonly invoked in the inviscid theory of hypersonic flow. beginning from this theoretical basis, a modified local flat-plate similarity scheme is derived, involving separate rules for velocity and enthalpy profiles, and is compared with exact similarity solutions and with the existing theory of hypersonic leading-edge interaction.
