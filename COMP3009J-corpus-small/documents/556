numerical comparison between exact and approximate theories of hypersonic inviscid flow past slender blunt nosed bodies. this paper presents numerical results of exact calculations of the inviscid equilibrium flow about a long hemisphere-cylinder in motion at hypersonic velocity. a comparison is made with blast wave as well as free layer theories of hypersonic flow. as a result of the comparison, it is concluded that the second-order blast wave theory can be used for the purpose of finding the shock shape and the body pressure distribution. however, this procedure is definitely empirical and cannot be justified on rational or theoretical grounds. we show that the presently calculated radial distribution of energy is radically different than that given by blast wave theory. if body shapes other than those considered here are of interest, the only reliable approach at the present time is to carry out numerical calculations. it was found that for certain flight velocities the pressure on the body does not decay to free stream pressure monotonically but overexpands.
