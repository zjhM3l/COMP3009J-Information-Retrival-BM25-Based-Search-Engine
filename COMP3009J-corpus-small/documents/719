tumbling bodies entering the atmosphere. the equations of motion of a tumbling flat plate entering an exponential atmosphere were linearized and solved analytically to obtain a simple expression for the altitude at which tumbling would cease and libration would commence. the plate had only three degrees of freedom, and aerodynamic forces were derived from newtonian impact theory. in the linear analysis, mean values of the drag and pitch damping coefficients so that flutter occurs in the range of a low-speed wind tunnel. a particular type of construction for supersonic flutter models is described in detail. methods of vibration testing, static testing, and flutter testing are discussed. particular emphasis is placed on the technique of varying flow parameters rather than model parameters to precipitate flutter. the tool for varying flow parameters is the variable mach number supersonic test section of the massachusetts institute of technology blowdown wind tunnel. the aerodynamic features of the supersonic test section are presented.
