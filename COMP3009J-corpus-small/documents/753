development of a quasi-steady approach to flutter and correlation with kernel-function results. the quasi-steady approach to flutter utilizes experimental or theoretical steady-state aerodynamic data to arrive at increased understanding of the flutter mechanism, and also, in many cases, acceptably accurate quantitative flutter predictions. circulation lag effects are neglected, but aerodynamic damping is included in the evaluation of the air forces. situations requiring the inclusion of rate aerodynamics for accurate flutter estimation are specified. a quasi-unsteady approach is also discussed, in which the approximate magnitude of the circulation lag function at flutter is included in simple modifications of quasi-steady parameters. closed-form solutions are derived for the flutter characteristics of a typical section with and without rate aerodynamics. application is then made to the rational flutter analysis of three-dimensional multi-degree-of-freedom lifting surfaces. a specific planform is evaluated in the mach-number range from zero to two. quasi-steady, quasi-unsteady, and kernel-function results are compared subsonically. quasi-steady results are utilized supersonically. primary applications of the quasi-steady approach are in the areas of preliminary design and parameter-variation studies, modification of more sophisticated flutter theories to force compatibility with available steady-state data, and flutter evaluation of complex configurations which can be rationally analyzed by steady-state aerodynamic theories, but for which no complete unsteady aerodynamic theories are presently available.
