numerical solutions for supersonic flow of an ideal gas around blunt two-dimensional bodies. the method described is an inverse one,. the shock shape is chosen and the solution proceeds downstream to a body. bodies blunter than circular cylinders are readily accessible, and any adiabatic index can be chosen. the lower limit to the free-stream mach number available in any case is determined by the extent of the subsonic field, which in turn depends upon the body shape. some discussion of the stability of the numerical processes is given. a set of solutions for flows about circular cylinders at several mach numbers and several values of the adiabatic index is included.
