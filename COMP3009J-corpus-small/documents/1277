a study of vortex cancellation. the cancellation of a vortex by means of another concentric vortex of equal strength but opposite spin is investigated. when such a cancellation occurs, there is a recovery of static pressure. the vortices are generated by means of two three-dimensional airfoils cantilevered from the duct wall, one being situated in the wake of the other. the airfoils have opposite effective angles of attack and therefore have trailing vortices of opposite spin, as required. it is demonstrated experimentally that there exists an optimum angle of attack for the second airfoil which cancels the vortex from the first airfoil and restores uniform flow downstream of the two airfoils. a theoretical solution of this optimum angle of attack is presented, and it is found to depend upon the angle of attack of the first airfoil and upon the geometrical properties of the wings. the pressure recovery accompanying the vortex cancellation is also studied. theoretical considerations, based on the model of a vortex filament in the center of a circular tube show that a maximum of 62 per cent of the static pressure drop across the first airfoil can be recovered. this maximum is imposed, irrespective of skin friction and separation losses, by the irreversibility associated with establishing a vortex field. experimental pressure recoveries of 50 per cent are realized. perhaps the primary value of the present study is the opportunity it provides to verify certain of the fundamental concepts of fluid mechanics which are brought into play when the trailing vortex system of a lifting wing is cancelled by a second wing.
