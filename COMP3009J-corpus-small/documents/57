applicability of the hypersonic similarity rule to pressure distributions which include the effects of rotation for bodies of revolution at zero angle of attack. the analysis of technical note 2250, 1950, is extended to include the effects of flow rotation. it is found that the theoretical pressure distributions over ogive cylinders can be related by the hypersonic similarity rule with sufficient accuracy for most engineering purposes. the error introduced into pressure distributions and drag of ogive cylinders by ignoring the rotation term in the characteristic equations is investigated. it is found that the influence of the rotation term on pressure distribution and drag depends only upon the similarity parameter k (mach number divided by fineness ratio). although the error in drag, due to neglect of the rotation term, is negligible at k=0.5, the error is about 30 percent at k=2.0. charts are presented for the rapid determination of pressure distributions for rotational flow over ogive cylinders for all values of the similarity parameter between 0.5 and of mach number and fineness ratio.
