investigation of separated flows in supersonic and subsonic streams with emphasis on the effect of transition. experimental and theoretical research has been conducted on flow separation associated with steps, bases, compression corners, curved surfaces, shock-wave boundary-layer reflections, and configurations producing leading-edge separation. results were obtained from pressure-distribution measurements, shadow-graph observations, high-speed motion pictures, and oil-film optics. the maximum scope of measurement encompassed mach numbers between 0.4 and 3.6, and length reynolds numbers between 4000 and 5000000. the principal variable controlling pressure distribution in the separated flows was found to be the location of transition relative to the reattachment and separation positions. classification is made of each separated flow into one of three regimes.. and /turbulent/ with transition upstream of separation. by this means of classificaiton it is possible to state rather literal results regarding the steadiness of flow and the influence of reynolds number within each regime. for certain pure laminar separations a theory for calculating dead-air pressure is advanced which agrees well with subsonic and supersonic experiments. this theory involves no empirical information and provides an explanation of why transition location relative to reattachment is important. a simple analysis of the equations for interaction of boundary-layer and external flow near either laminar or turbulent separation indicates the pressure rise to vary as the square root of the wall shear stress at the beginning of interaction. various experiments substantiate tnis variation for most test conditions. an incidental observation is that the stability of a separated laminar mixing layer increases markedly with an increase in mach number. the possible significance of this observation is discussed.
