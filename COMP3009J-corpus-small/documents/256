an experimental study of the glancing interaction between a shock wave and a turbulent boundary layer. an experimental study has been made at mach numbers from 1.6 to 2.0 of the interaction between the turbulent boundary layer on a side wall of a wind tunnel and the shock wave produced by a plate mounted on the wall. under these conditions the shock wave boundary layer interaction was three dimensional at least over the region investigated (up to 10 boundary layer thicknesses from the plate). it was found that the boundary layer was separated by a shock wave of strength type occur on the sides of fuselages at the wing fuselage junction and may therefore be important with regard to the design of waisted shapes.
