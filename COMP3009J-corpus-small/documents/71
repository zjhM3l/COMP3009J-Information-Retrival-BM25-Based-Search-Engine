laminar boundary layer behind shock advancing into stationary fluid. a study was made of the laminar compressible boundary layer induced by a shock wave advancing into a stationary fluid bounded by a wall. for weak shock waves, the boundary layer is identical with that which occurs when an infinite wall is impulsively set into uniform motion shocks. velocity and temperature profiles, recovery factors, and skin-friction and heat-transfer coefficients are tabulated for a wide range of shock strengths.
