vibration isolation of aircraft power plants. vibration in aircraft structure can almost always be traced to vibratory forces originating from the power plant. these forces are transmitted to the aircraft in two ways.. (1) by the action of air forces upon the surfaces of the aircraft in, or adjacent to, the slip stream of the propeller, and (2) by direct transmission of unbalanced forces from the power plant through the engine mounting. the latter has always caused the preponderance of disturbance. vibratory stresses induced in the engine mounting structure occasionally produce fatigue failures in the associated parts, and always shorten the useful life of the entire aircraft structure. more important, however, are the psychological and physiological effects of continuous vibration and its attendant noise on the passengers and crew. this may very likely be the major source of the rapid fatigue which is so intimately associated with flying. the importance and desirability of drastically reducing vibration can hardly be questioned. this paper is limited to a consideration of the directly transmitted forces and, further, considers the power plants as rigid bodies attached by flexible means to the aircraft which is also considered as a rigid body of relatively large mass. it is also limited to the case of engines and engine supporting structures having axial symmetry (radial engines), although the methods employed could easily be extended to other cases.
