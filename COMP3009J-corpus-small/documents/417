on the stability of two dimensional parallel flows. this is the last part of the author's theory of the stability of plane laminar motion. (for parts 1 and 2, cf. the same quart. 3, 117-142, 218-234 (1945),. these rev. 7,225,226.) the stability character of a viscous fluid is considered in detail. the author proceeds first to give a proof of a criterion of stability due to heisenberg.. if a velocity profile has an number and phase velocity, the disturbance with the same wave number is unstable in the real fluid when the reynolds number is sufficiently large. this destabilizing effect of viscosity is one of the most interesting phenomena in the general stability theory,. its physical and mathematical significance is carefully discussed. the author then discusses the behavior of the so-called neutral curve for the two characteristic types of velocity distribution, the boundary layer type profile and the symmetrical profile. the asymptotic behavior of the neutral curve is discussed first. the main difference between profiles with and without a point of inflection is that the two branches of the neutral curve approach and for profiles with a flex, but both converge to for the profile without a flex. the most important results are as follows. for sufficiently large reynolds number r. (2) there always exists a minimum r below which the motion is stable. a similar result was obtained by synge from energy considerations. synge found a limiting curve below which the motion is necessarily stable. the author's discussion of the asymptotic behavior of the curves shows further that there always exists a maximum value of a beyond which the motion is stable for all reynolds numbers. hence the qualitative shape of the curve is determined. the author proceeds to show that simple approximate expressions for the stability limit can be obtained from his general analysis for a given velocity profile. these approximate stability limits for plane poiseuille flow and blasius flow are found to be r=5906 and r=502. the reynolds numbers are based on the width of the channel and the displacement thickness, respectively. finally, the method for computing the complete instability curve is presented and the plane poiseuille case and the blasius problem worked out in detail. the stability limit for blasius flow had been given before by tollmien and schlichting. the present more exact computations agree well with tollmien's result as far as the minimum critical reynolds number is concerned. the value found here is r=420. the neutral curve for poiseuille motion had not been obtained before. the minimum critical number here is found to be r=5314. the agreement with the estimate from the simple criterion mentioned above is thus very good. a discussion of the physical significance of the viscous effects and of future developments concludes the paper.
