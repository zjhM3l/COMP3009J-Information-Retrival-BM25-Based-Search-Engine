study of the oscillatory motion of manned vehicles entering the earth's atmosphere. an analysis is made of the oscillatory motion of vehicles which traverse arbitrarily prescribed trajectories through the atmosphere. expressions for the oscillatory motion are derived as continuous functions of the properties of the trajectory. results are applied to a study of the oscillatory behavior of re-entry vehicles which have decelerations that remain within limits of human tolerance. it is found that a deficiency of aerodynamic damping for such vehicles may have more serious consequences than it does for comparable ballistic missiles.
