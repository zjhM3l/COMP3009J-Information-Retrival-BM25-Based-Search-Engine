the shapes and lift-dependent drags on some sweptback wings designed for m= 1. 2. the camber and twist distributions needed to produce a constant span-wise -distribution and certain linear chordwise load distributions have been calculated by linearised supersonic theory at for a set of 34 thin sweptback wings. the wing planforms cover a range of aspect ratios from 2.0 to 3.5 and leading-edge sweep angles from 55 to 70. both leading and trailing edges are subsonic at the design mach number, and the slenderness parameter is between 0.19 and 0.40. the lift-dependent vortex and wave drags associated with these loadings have also been calculated, and appear not to be excessive in almost all the cases considered.
