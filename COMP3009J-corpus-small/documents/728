free vibrations of continuous skin stringer panels. the determination of the natural frequencies and normal modes of vibration for continuous panels, representing more or less typical fuselage skin-panel construction for modern airplanes, is discussed in this paper are considered. a numerical example is presented, and analytical results for a particular structural configuration agree favorably with available experimental measurements.
