some problems of polar missile control. a polar-controlled missile is one in which manoeuvre is carried out by rotations about roll and pitch axes, that is, in the manner of a conventional aeroplane. this paper discusses some problems in the application of this form of control to homing missiles. in comparison with the alternative cartesian configuration, this method presents some special design problems. in the former case, it is often possible to resolve the motion into two planes and consider the pitch and yaw control systems as independent two-dimensional problems. this simplification is not possible in the case of polar control and it is usually necessary to consider the whole three-dimensional system. the equations of motion which result are, in general, not susceptible to analysis. because of this, the design of control systems requires extensive use of simulators.
