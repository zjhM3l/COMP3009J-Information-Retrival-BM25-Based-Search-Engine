on the strength distribution of noise sources along a jet. the spatial distribution of noise sources along a jet is investigated by application of lighthill's theory to regions of 'similar' profiles. the analysis refers to the noise power emitted by a 'slice' of jet (section between two adjacent planes normal to the axis) as a function of distance x of the slice from the nozzle. it is found that this power is essentially constant with x in the initial mixing region (x law), then further downstream (say 8 or 10 diameters from the nozzle) falls off extremely fast (x law or faster) in the fully developed jet. because of this striking attenuation of strength with distance, it is concluded that the mixing region produces the bulk of the noise and must dominate in muffler behavior,. conversely, the 'fat' part of the jet must contribute much less to the total noise power than is commonly supposed. powell's experiments on the effects of nozzle velocity profile on total noise power are interpreted qualitatively. the behavior of multiple-nozzle or corrugated mufflers, both as to overall quieting and frequency-shifting, is also interpreted in the light of the results. the possibility emerges that such mufflers may be improved without serious thrust loss by the addition of a sound-attenuating shroud.
