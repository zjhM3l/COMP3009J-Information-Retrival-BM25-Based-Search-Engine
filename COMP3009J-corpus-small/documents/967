a study of laminar compressible viscous pipe flow accelerated by an axial body force, with application to magnetogasdynamics. a study is made of the steady laminar flow of a compressible viscous fluid in a circular pipe when the fluid is accelerated by an axial body force. the application of the theory to the magnetofluidmechanics of an electrically conducting gas accelerated by electric and magnetic fields is discussed. constant viscosity, thermal conductivity, and electrical conductivity are assumed. fully developed flow velocity and temperature profiles are shown, and detailed results of the accelerating flow development, including velocity and pressure as functions of distance, are given for the case where the axial body force is constant and for the case where it is a linear function of velocity. from these results are determined the pipe entry length and the pressure difference required.
