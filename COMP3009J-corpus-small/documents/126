an investigation of two-dimensional supersonic base pressures. an investigation of the base pressure behind wedges at mach numbers 2 and 3 in the laminar and the transitional regime is reported. temperature and velocity traverses through the mixing zone are shown and exploratory investigations of the wake vortex by use of hot wires and flow-visualization techniques are described. it is found that the laminar two-dimensional base pressure agrees well with chapman's theoretical predictions. the shear layer exhibits gross velocity distributions characteristic of the free jet mixing zone, but also shows disturbances that originate in the expansion-turning of the oncoming boundary layer. an interesting trailing vortex is observed, which is explained in terms of nonuniform mixing rate in the wake.
