theoretical investigation of the ablation of a glass-type heat protection shield of varied material properties at the stagnation point of a re-entering irbm. the melting-type heat protection at the stagnation point of a re-entering irbm is treated by employing homogeneous, opaque, and nondecomposing glass shields which do not exceed a temperature of some effects due to variations of the glass properties. the ballistic re-entry vehicle has a nose diameter of 0.635 m, a ballistic factor of 3.5 x 10, a re-entry angle of 124.9 (from the vertical) at an altitude of 100 km, and a re-entry speed of 4.5. the performance of 36 different glass shields with assumed combinations of material properties is investigated by employing a calculation method which yields practically exact, transient solutions for the problem. as a corollary, results for a certain steady flight state are also given. the discussions made it possible to derive under realistic flight conditions some thermal characteristics for the employment of thin, or light-weight, glass shields. investigation of these hypothetical glass shields leads to the conclusion that a low thermal conductivity and a high specific heat, and thus, a small thermal diffusivity are most desirable. a small thermal diffusivity yields high surface temperatures, causing a high radiative heat transfer out of the shield,. and steep temperature profiles normal to the surface, causing a small thermal penetration across the shield with little total ablation of the shield. results show that for the assumed irbm re-entry, the necessary thickness of the employed glass shields increases monotonically with thermal diffusivity which is the only material parameter affecting this thickness. a high viscosity level and a high emissivity constant of the surface of the supposedly opaque shield are also desirable,. although, these two properties exert a comparatively small influence on the overall performance when disregarding glass shields with an extremely low viscosity level.
