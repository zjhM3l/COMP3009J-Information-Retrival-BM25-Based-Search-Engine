an experimental study of the turbulen coundary layer on a shock tube wall. interferometric measurements were made of the density profiles of an unsteady turbulent boundary layer on the flat wall of a shock tube. the investigation included both subsonic and supersonic flow (mach numbers of 0.50 and 1.77) with no pressure gradient and with heat transfer to a cold wall. velocity profiles and average skin-friction coefficients were calculated. effects on the velocity profile of surface roughness and flow length are examined.
