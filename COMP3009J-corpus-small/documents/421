analytic study of induced pressure on long bodies of revolution with varying nose bluntness at hypersonic speeds. a systematic study of induced pressures on a series of bodies of revolution with varying nose bluntness has been made by using the method of characteristics for a perfect gas. the fluid mediums investigated were air and helium and the mach number range was from 5 to 40. a study of representative shock shapes was also made. flow parameters obtained from the blast-wave analogy gave good correlations of induced pressures and shock shapes. the induced-pressure correlations yielded empirical equations for air and helium which cover the complete range of nose bluntness considered. (nose fineness ratios varied from 0.4 to 4.) available experimental results were in good agreement with the characteristics solutions. properties connected with the concept of hypersonic similitude enabled correlations of the calculations to be made with respect to nose shape, mach number, and ratio of specific heats.
