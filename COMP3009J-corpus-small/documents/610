corner interference effects. the three-dimensional incompressible flow of fluid along the corner of two semi-infinite plates intersecting at right angles, especially the interference of the boundary layers of the two plates, is discussed. mainly, the more important case of turbulent boundary layer is treated by means of experimental studies carried out at the technical university of braunschweig. some theoretical results for laminar flow are also taken into account. in order to describe the interference effects in the boundary layer, an interference displacement thickness and an interference skin friction have been introduced. it is shown from experiments and also from theoretical considerations how these two quantities depend on reynolds number. furthermore, the influence of interference on the transition from laminar to turbulent flow is investigated. in addition, some preliminary results are given about the effect of the pressure gradient on the interference effects.
