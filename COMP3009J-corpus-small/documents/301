approximate design of sharp-cornered supersonic nozzles. a modified parabolic curve appears to be in close proximity to that obtained by either the method of characteristics or the wave method. thus an attempt has been made to use analytic geometry to determine approximately the contour of a two-dimensional, sharp-cornered supersonic nozzle in a very short time.
