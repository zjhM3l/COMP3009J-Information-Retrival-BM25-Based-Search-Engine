rapid laminar boundary layer calculations by piece-wise application of similar solutions. a method is presented for the rapid calculation of the incompressible laminar boundary layer in an arbitrary flow around either a two-dimensional or a rotationally-symmetrical body. the solution is obtained without recourse to von karman's momentum equation by means of a coarse step-by-step procedure in which each segment of the velocity distribution is approximated by one of the falkner-skan family of similar flows. solutions have at least as much accuracy as those of any other one-parameter approximate method, and in certain cases the solutions become exact. in regions of accelerating velocity, the accuracy appears to be very high. in decelerating flows, separation is predicted somewhat early compared with exact solutions that is, the method is conservative in contrast to the von karman-pohlhausen procedure which sometimes fails to predict separation that actually exists. the method is the most rapid hand procedure known to the author, provided the full history of the boundary layer is required. if only a thickness such as is needed at one point on a surface, then it is about equal in speed to the quadrature method. but, if several values of or other properties along a surface are required, it is appreciably faster than the quadrature method. characteristically, only four steps are needed between the forward stagnation point and the pressure peak. once the velocity-distribution data are available, each step in a two-dimensional calculation requires about 5 minutes, using a slide rule.
