effect of wall divergence on sonic flows in solid wall tunnels. the effect of wall divergence (in excess of the normal value given for compensating the boundary layer growth on the tunnel walls), on the simulation of sonic flows in solid wall wind tunnels is presented in this note which is a condensed version of ref. 1.
