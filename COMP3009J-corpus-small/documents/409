on the base pressure resulting from the interaction of a supersonic external stream with a sonic or subsonic jet. it is shown that the two-dimensional base pressure problems relating to base bleed into the wake of blunt-trailing-edge airfoils, or the interaction between an external supersonic or sonic slipstream with a sonic or subsonic jet stream of a jet engine, can be calculated by theoretical considerations. constant-pressure, isoenergetic, turbulent mixing between the streams and the stagnant fluid in the wake is assumed. the theoretical calculations are in good agreement with the experimental results.
