the supersonic flow about a blunt body of revolution for gases at chemical equilibrium. the supersonic flow about a blunt body of revolution for gases at chemical equilibrium. a method to determine the shock wave, and its location, about a body of revolution moving at supersonic speeds is given. the method provides also the means to compute the flow characteristics in the shock layer. the fluid in which the motion takes place is assumed to be in chemical equilibrium within the shock layer ,. its thermochemical properties must be known. the essential new features of the method are.. a) it solves the direct problem, i. e., the initial data are the conditions upstream and the body shape ,. b) the integration of the fundamental equations is done in the physical plane and the difficulties inherent to other, less direct, mathematical formulations of the problem are avoided. a physical interpretation of the method is made which is in accord with the analytical definition of the problem.
