structural loads surveys on two tilt-wing vtol configurations. the results of two structural-loads surveys are summarized. the first loads program discussed concerns the airframe vibratory loads encountered during flight tests of the vz-2 tilt-wing vtol aircraft throughout the operational range from hover to cruise flight. the primary sources of airframe vibration were wing-stall buffeting and tail buffeting in descents. the second loads program discussed concerns the initial results of a structural-loads survey conducted as part of the wind-tunnel test of a large-scale tilt-wing research model. this loads program deals with the steady wing loads measured throughout simulated transition from hover to cruise.
