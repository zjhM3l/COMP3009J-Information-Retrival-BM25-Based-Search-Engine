the effect of end plates on swept wings. existing methods of calculating the effect of endplates on straight wings are modified so as to apply to swept wings. the changes in overall lift and drag, and also the spanwise distribution of the additional load, can be calculated. the theoretical results are compared with experimental results obtained on swept wings, including new measurements of lift, drag and pitching moment, made on an untapered the method of calculation is also extended to cover the effect of the tip vortex which is formed on wings without endplates.
