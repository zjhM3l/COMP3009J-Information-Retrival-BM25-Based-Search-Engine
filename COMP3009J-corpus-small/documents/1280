wings with minimum drag due to lift in supersonic flow. it has been shown by r. t. jones that, in order to produce minimum drag, the given lift must be distributed over the wing surface in such a way that the sum of the downwash induced by this distribution and the downwash induced in reversed flow is constant over the wing surface. this combined downwash can be expressed by an integral which contains the load as a function of the spanwise and chordwise coordinate. the problem of finding the appropriate load distribution is thus reduced to the problem of finding the solution of a rather cumbersome integral equation. the severe spanwise singularity of the kernel function is handled most easily, as in corresponding subsonic problems, by an approximate integration over interpolation polynomials. the chordwise load distribution is represented by a limited series development in legendre polynomials. the sigularity of the kernel function along the mach lines through any pivotal point can be avoided by a similar legendre development of the combined induced downwash which is constant. the integral equation is thus converted into a system of linear equations for the unknown coefficients of the legendre functions of the load distribution at a limited number of spanwise stations. practical calculations are carried out on an electronic computer. the solutions yield the optimum load distribution and the local incidence (twist, camber, etc.) necessary to realize this distribution. for many wing plan forms, considerable gains over a plane wing appear possible.
