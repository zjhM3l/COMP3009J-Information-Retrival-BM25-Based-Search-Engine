oscillatory aerodynamic coefficients for a unified supersonic hypersonic strip theory. the shock tube is shown to be a feasible research tool for conducting boundary-layer transition experiments. the use of the shock tube permits the study of transition with highly cooled boundary layers, as may be encountered on hypersonic vehicles. boundary-layer transition investigations have been made on optically polished pyrex hemisphere-cylinder and ellipse-cylinder models with stagnation-to-wall enthalpy ratios between 4.5 and roughness estimated to be less than 1 microinch (rms). transition was detected by measurements of the heat-transfer rates on the model surface. the shock tube experiments indicated that a characteristic feature of transition of a highly cooled boundary layer on a hemisphere was the simultaneous occurrence of transition over the entire supersonic portion of the hemisphere. this implies that transition first occurred in the sonic region. the transition reynolds number (based on local fluid properties at the outer edge of the boundary layer and the momentum thickness) in the sonic region increased from about 225 to 325 as the stagnation- to-wall enthalpy ratio increased from about 9.5 to 29.5. transition occurred along the cylindrical portion of the hemisphere-cylinder model at a nearly constant momentum thickness reynolds number, increasing from about 400 to 625 as the stagnation- to-wall enthalpy ratio increased from about 9.5 to 29.5. the highly cooled boundary layers obtained on the cylindrical portion of the shock tube hemisphere-cylinder model provided an extension of nasa transition results obtained on a cooled hemisphere-cone-cylinder model in a wind tunnel. the transition reynolds numbers obtained from these shock tube data were of the same order of magnitude as the minimum transition reynolds numbers obtained in the wind-tunnel experiments. the results indicate that, for practical purposes, boundary-layer cooling is not a critical transition parameter for blunt bodies with a highly cooled boundary layer resulting from a stagnation- to-wall enthalpy ratio of about 3 to 30. that is, the transition reynolds number did not vary significantly with boundary- layer cooling in this cooling range, but transition always occurred at a low reynolds number (between about 350,000 and 750,000 based on local external properties and a distance along the body surface from the stagnation point). the boundary-layer history (body shape history) appeared to be an important parameter affecting the magnitude of the reynolds number for transition and the amount of increase in the transition reynolds number with increased boundary-layer cooling. that is, transition occurred at a lower reynolds number on the ellipse-cylinder configuration than on the hemisphere-cylinder. also, the increase in transition reynolds number with an increase in boundary-layer cooling was even less significant for the ellipse-cylinder than the hemisphere-cylinder.
