blunt-cone pressure distributions at hypersonic mach numbers. the static pressure distributions on the surface of a blunted 7.5 degree-half-angle cone have recently been experimentally determined in the cal 48 inch hypersonic shock tunnel. this facility and the associated instrumentation are described in detail in ref. 1. these tests covered a mach number range of 8 to 18 at a reynolds number per foot of approximately 1 times 10 to the 5th power., the models included one flat-faced cone and two hemispherically blunted cones.
