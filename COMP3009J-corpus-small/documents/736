the bending of a wedge shaped plate. a general method of solution is given in this paper for the problem of bending of a wedge-shaped thin elastic plate with arbitrary boundary conditions on the radial edges in the case of a single load. the solution is carried out for a plate with clamped edges and a single load on the bisector radius of the plate. stress distribution along the edges is shown and the behavior of the solution near the corner point is discussed for several opening angles of the plate.
