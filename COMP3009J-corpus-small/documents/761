buckling of sandwich under normal pressure. a theoretical study is made of the buckling of a sandwich sphere comprised of a core layer of low-modulus material and two thin facing layers of higher modulus material. the solution for the buckling resistance of the sphere under normal external pressure is obtained by linearized theory, and is reducible to the classical solution for monocoque spherical shells. critical buckling pressures are calculated for various radius-thickness ratios and sphere materials.
