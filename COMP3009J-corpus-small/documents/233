the theoretical wave drag of some bodies of revolution. this report investigates the wave drag of bodies of revolution with pointed or open-nose forebodies and pointed or truncated afterbodies. the 'quasi-cylinder' and 'slender-body' theories are reviewed, a reversibility theorem is established, and the concept of the interference effect of a forebody on an afterbody is introduced. the theories are applied to bodies whose profiles are either straight or parabolic arcs, formulae and curves being given for forebody and afterbody drag, and for the interference drag. the results of the two theories are compared and are seen to agree well in the region of geometries where both theories are applicable.
