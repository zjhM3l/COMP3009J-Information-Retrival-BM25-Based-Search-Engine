a theory for the core of a leading edge vortex. in the flow past a slender delta wing at incidence can be observed a roughly axially symmetric core of spiralling fluid, formed by the rolling up of the shear layer that separates from a leading edge. the aim in this report is to predict the flow field within this vortex core, given appropriate conditions at its outside edge. the basic assumptions are core. in addition it is assumed that the flow is axially symmetric and incompressible. together, these admit outer and inner solutions for the core from the equations of motion. for the outer solution the sub-core is ignored, and the flow is taken to be inviscid (but rotational) and conical. the resulting solution consists of simple expressions for the velocity components and pressure. for the inner solution, which applies to the diffusive sub-core, the flow is taken to be laminar, and approximations, some based on the boundary conditions and some analogous to those of boundary layer theory, are made. the solution obtained in this case is a first approximation, and is presented in tabular form. a sample calculation yields results which are in good qualitative and fair quantitative agreement with experimental measurements.
