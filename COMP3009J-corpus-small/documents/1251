viscous flow past a quarter infinite plate. a study is made of the motion of an incompressible viscous fluid past a quarter-infinite plate, whose leading edge is perpendicular to and whose side edge is parallel to the undisturbed direction of the stream. it is assumed that the kinematic viscosity is small. the first approximation is taken to be the undisturbed motion, and successive approximations are obtained by iferation. the second approximation is the blasius shear layer necessary to satisfy the boundary conditions on the plate. in turn, this layer leads to a velocity component normal to the plate which needs a potential solution, in which the velocities are 0, to match with the conditions at infinity. further, the match at the edge of the blasius shear layer must be completed to 0 by introducing a secondary shear layer. the regions near the leading and side edges are considered separately,. in particular, the neighborhood of the side edge needs special care, because the determination of the chief terms is complicated by the presence of powers of log. in particular it is shown that the effect of the edge is to change the skin-friction coefficient by a factor
