elastic stability of simply supported corrugated core sand- wich cylinders. theoretical buckling coefficients are obtained for the general instability of simply supported, corrugated core sandwich circular cylinders under combined loads with the core oriented parallel to the longitudinal axis of the cylinder. buckling curves are presented for axial compression, external lateral pressure, torsion, and some typical interactions. the differential equations of equilibrium used to obtain the buckling equations were derived from the small deflection equations of stein and mayer which include the effect of deformation due to transverse shear. these equations are solved by galerkin's equation. remarks are made concerning the probable validity of the results of the small deflection theory for sandwich shells.
