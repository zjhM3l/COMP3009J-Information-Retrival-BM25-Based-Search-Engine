supersonic axially symmetric nozzles. at each of twenty-one exit mach numbers, ranging from 1.008 to 8.238, ten supersonic axially symmetric nozzle shapes with plane sonic surfaces have been computed on the eniac by the method of characteristics. the boundary of the shortest of each group of ten has a sharp edge at the sonic plane, while the others have smooth boundaries. this report describes the computational procedures and presents a sample of the results for twenty nozzles. more extensive and elaborate tables of the results of the entire computations are available at the ballistic research laboratories. nozzle contours can be obtained accurately from them by interpolation for exit mach numbers between 1.479 and 8.238 for a wide range of ratios of nozzle length to throat diameter.
