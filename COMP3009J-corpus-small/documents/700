two and three-dimensional unsteady lift problems in high speed flight. the problem of transient lift on two- and three-dimensional wings flying at high speeds is discussed as a boundary-value problem for the classical wave equation. kirchhoffs formula is applied so that the analysis is reduced, just as in the steady state, to an investigation of sources and doublets. the applications include the evaluation of indicial lift and pitchingmoment curves for two-dimensional sinking and pitching wings flying at mach numbers equal to 0, 0.8, 1.0, 1.2, and triangular wings in both forward and reversed flow are presented and compared with the two-dimensional values.
