studies on two dimensional flows of compressible fluid. it is well-known that when the flow is everywhere subsonic in a field of flow, the nature of the two-dimensional isentropic flow of a compressible perfect fluid differs only slightly from that of the corresponding flow of an incompressible perfect fluid. thus, in such a case, we can calculate the field of flow by any of the well-known methods of approximation. on the other hand, if the flow is supersonic throughout the field, we can determine the flow pattern by the method of characteristics.
