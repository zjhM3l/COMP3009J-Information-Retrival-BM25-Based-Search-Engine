a summary of the supersonic pressure drag of bodies of revolution. a number of approximate theories for supersonic and hypersonic flow over bodies of revolution at zero angle of attack are appraised by a critical comparison with characteristics and second-order results, with the use of hypersonic similarity as a basis for the comparison. most of the approximate theories are inadequate except over very limited ranges of fineness ratio and mach number. the combination of second-order supersonic theory and second-order shock-expansion theory provides consistently good results throughout the supersonic speed range. on the basis of exact (or nearly exact) supersonic solutions and a limited amount of test data and theory in the transonic region, summary design curves are developed that give the pressure drag of conical and ogive noses and conical and ogive boattails over the complete range of transonic, supersonic, and hypersonic mach numbers. other shapes can be analyzed in the same manner, provided that an equivalent amount of data is available. the analysis is made with the assumption of inviscid flow, so that the effects of boundary-layer growth, shock boundary-layer interaction, and flow separation are not included. the present correlations provide a sound basis of inviscid-flow results from which these additional viscous effects can be evaluated.
