procedure for calculating flutter at high supersonic speed including camber deflections, and comparison with experimental results. a method which may be used at high supersonic mach numbers is described for calculating the flutter speed of wings having camber in their deflection modes. the normal coupled vibration modes of the wing are used to derive the equations of motion. chord deflections of the vibration modes are approximated by polynomials. the wing may have a control surface and may carry external stores although no aerodynamic forces on the stores are presented. the aerodynamic forces that are assumed to be acting on the wing are obtained from piston theory and also from a quasi-steady form of a theory for two-dimensional steady flow. airfoil shape and thickness effects are taken account of in the analysis. the method is used to calculate the flutter speed of some wings which had been previously tested at mach numbers of 1.3 to 3.0. comparison of the calculations and experiment is made for flat-plate 60 and 45 delta wings and also for an untapered 45 sweptback wing.
