free-flight techniques for high speed aerodynamic research. the development rocket-borne and rocket-launched high-speed airplane model test is described. details of airborne components, telemetering units, tracking, and their calibration are also discussed. tests on controls, drag measurements, longitudinal stability evaluations, lift measurements, pressure measurements, aeroelastic estimations, and sonic bang recordings are effected. the reynolds numbers involved are much higher than are usual in the wind tunnel, and extensions of mach numbers are obtained beyond the tunnel limits, both free of the tunnel wall interference.
