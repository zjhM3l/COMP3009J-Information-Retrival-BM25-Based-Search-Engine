effect of uniformly distributed roughness on turbulent skin-friction drag at supersonic speeds. an experimental program was carried out in the 18-in. by 20-in. supersonic wind tunnel of the jet propulsion laboratory to determine the effect of uniformly distributed sand-grain roughness on the skin-friction drag of a body of revolution for the case of a turbulent boundary layer. the mach number range covered was 1.98 to 4.54, and the reynolds number varied from about 3 x 10 to 8 x 10. some data were also obtained at a mach number of 0.70. at speeds up to a mach number of 5 and for roughness sizes such that the quadratic resistance law holds, the compressibility effect is indirect, and the skin-friction drag is a function of only the roughness reynolds number, exactly as in the incompressible case. it is shown that the entire compressibility effect is a reduction of the fluid density at the surface as the mach number increases. the critical roughness, below which the surface is hydraulically smooth, is,. this is equal to the thickness of the laminar sublayer for a smooth surface for both compressible and incompressible flow. over the range of roughness sizes considered here, there appears to be no wave drag associated with the drag due to roughness. the shift in the turbulent veocity profile for a rough surface at supersonic speeds is a function of only the roughness reynolds number and quantitatively follows exactly the same law as that for the incompressible case.
