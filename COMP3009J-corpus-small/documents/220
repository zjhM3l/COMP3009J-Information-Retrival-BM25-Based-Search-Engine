a general purpose analogue correlator for the analysis of random noise signals. a large proportion of the current research programme of the department of aeronautics and astronautics is concerned with the study of jet noise and boundary layer pressure fluctuations and their effect on aircraft structures. early in the work it was decided that for a complete description of the random processes involved it would be necessary in the experimental programme to make correlation measurements in addition to the more standard spectrum and amplitude distribution measurements. it was also felt that it would be desirable from the university point of view to construct a general purpose correlator which could later be used on other types of work. to this end it was decided to give the correlator a wider bandwidth than might strictly have been necessary for the problems on hand. subsequent development work has amply justified this decision.
