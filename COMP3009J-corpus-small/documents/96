review of published data on the effect of roughness on transition from laminar to turbulent flow. a review is presented of the published data on the effect of roughness, especially single roughness elements, on transition from laminar to turbulent flow, in which an attempt is made to reanalyze and correlate the available information. the reanalysis shows that the transition reynolds number of a flat plate with zero pressure gradient is a function of the ratio of the height of the roughness element to the displacement thickness of the boundary layer at the element, this functional relation being a better representation of the data than a constant critical reynolds number of the roughness element. other data show that the effects of roghness are similar in streams of different initial turbulence and that a plot of the ratio of transition reynolds number of the rough plate to that for the smooth plate against the ratio of the height of the roughness element to displacement thickness of the boundary layer at the element gives good correlation of all the data for a given shape when transition occurs downstream from the roughness element. at a certain value of the height-thickness ratio dependent on the stream speed, location of roughness element, and airstream turbulence, the transition position reaches the element and remains there as the height or the stream speed is further increased. the paper also discusses available data on the effect of distributed roughness on transition on a flat plate, as well as some of the published data on roughness effects on transition on air-foils.
