on the flow of a sonic stream past an airfoil surface. this study of the flow about an airfoil in a near-sonic stream indicates the important factors determining the pressure distribution on the airfoil. analysis of the mach wave pattern suggests that the supersonic domain of the flow can be derived from two simple-wave flows, one arising from the mach waves reflected at the sonic line and the other from the changes in airfoil surface slope. the compressive effect of the reflected mach waves is determined quantitatively as a function of airfoil leading-edge geometry from an analysis of measured pressure distributions for uncambered airfoils,. and it is shown how this can be superimposed on the wave system from the curved surface to give an equivalent simple-wave flow over the airfoil. an application of this scheme to the calculation of the pressure distribution over an airfoil in a sonic stream gives results in good agreement with experiment.
