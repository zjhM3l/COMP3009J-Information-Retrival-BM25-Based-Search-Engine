predicted shock envelopes about two types of vehicles at large angles of attack. methods based on oblique- and normal-shock relationships and the continuity of mass flow through suitably chosen volume elements between the shock and body were developed to predict shock envelopes about two types of vehicles being considered for atmosphere entry. one type is a high-drag capsule shape. the other type is essentially a slender triangular wing capable of providing high lift or high drag, depending on the angle of attack. predicted and measured shock envelopes were compared for a mach number range of 3 to 15 for vehicles at high angles of attack,. good agreement was found. most of the available experimental data were in a speed and temperature range in which no important real-gas effects occurred.
