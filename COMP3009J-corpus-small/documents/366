helium injection into the boundary layer at an axisymmetric stagnation point. this report presents a theoretical analysis of the boundary layer at an axisymmetric stagnation point with large rates of helium injection. the exact stagnation-point boundary-layer equations are integrated numerically with approximate representations of the gas properties. the treatment of the two-point boundary-value problem employed herein is shown to be useful for various boundary-layer and mixing problems. the exact solutions indicate that for large rates of injection the boundary layer can be represented by a thick, inner layer of constant shear, temperature, and composition and by a relatively thin outer region in which the flow variables adjust to their free-stream values. an inviscid-flow model is shown to lead to accurate predictions of this shear layer and will thus provide sufficiently accurate profiles for use in the study of the downstream influence of stagnation-point mass transfer. the heat transfer to the stagnation point is also considered. tabulations of the eigenvalues for a variety of wall conditions and injection rates are given.
