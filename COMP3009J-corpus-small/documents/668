measurements of stagnation point heat transfer at low reynolds number. measurements of stagnation point heat transfer are presented in the reynolds number range between the free molecular flow and the range where modified boundary layer theory still applies. the measurements are compared with the analytical methods set forth by ferri, zakkay, and ting. the results show smooth transition between the two regions and indicate that the predicted reynolds number for which the modified boundary layer theory can be used is in agreement with experiments. in the lower range of reynolds number the ratio of decreases and reaches a value of 1 at a reynolds number of 40.
