uniformly valid second-order solution for supersonic flow over cruciform surfaces. considered is the second-order supersonic flow over a cruciform configuration consisting of two intersecting rectangular wings of high aspect ratio. the practical interest is in application to supersonic inlets, wing-body junctions and vehicle fins. the fundamental interest centers about identification and adjustment of the severe local failures of the ordinary second-order theory. for wings with discontinuous slopes, discontinuous potentials occur across the planar shock and square-root singularities in the velocities occur at the intersection of these shocks with the cruciform surfaces. the problem is simple enough so that these interesting features stand out clearly. a second-order solution uniformly valid to first order is constructed by adjustment of the ordinary second-order solution obtained first. the uniformly valid solution has two different series representations in the thickness parameter. one is the ordinary second-order series in ascending integral powers of the thickness parameter which is valid in the interior of the vertex-centered undisturbed mach cone, and the other is a series containing fractional powers which is valid adjacent to and upstream of this mach cone. the uniformly valid solution gives the detailed wave structure and shows a flow regime upstream of the vertex-centered undisturbed mach cone not predicted by the ordinary theory. the two solutions are otherwise identical. the wave structure consists of a pyramidal arrangement of planar shocks adjacent to and upstream of the above cone, followed by weaker oblique expansion fans and finally by two extremely weak shocks coincident with the vertex-centered undisturbed mach cone. as an example of the above, detailed results are presented for the case of two intersecting wedges. application of the techniques to other quasi-cylindrical problems is discussed.
