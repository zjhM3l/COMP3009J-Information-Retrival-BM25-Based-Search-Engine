note on creep buckling of columns. forty-three cylinders of 40-inch length and 16-inch diameter, made of 5052-0 aluminum-alloy sheets of thickness, were subjected to bending moments constant along the cylinder and in time in an oven which maintained a constant temperature of 500 f during the test. all the cylinders failed by buckling. the time that elapsed between load application and collapse was measured.
