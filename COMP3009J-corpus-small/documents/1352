aerodynamic investigation of a parabolic body of revolution at mach number of 1. 92 and some effects of an annular supersonic jet exhausting from the base. an aerodynamic investigation of a parabolic body of revolution was conducted at a mach number of 1.92 with and without an annular supersonic jet exhausting from the base. measurements with the jet inoperative were made of lift, drag, pitching moment, radial and longitudinal pressure distributions, and base pressures. with the jet in operation, measurements were made of the pressures over the rear of the body with the primary variables being angle of attack, ratio of jet velocity to freestream velocity, and ratio of jet pressure to stream pressure. the results with the jet inoperative showed that the radial pressures over the body varied appreciably from the distribution generally employed in most approximate theories. the linearized solutions for lift, pitching moment, and center of pressure gave relatively poor predictions of the experimental results. an analysis of several theoretical methods for calculating pressure distribution and wave drag showed that some methods gave results in considerable disagreement with experimental values. maximum effects of the jet were obtained at the lower ratio of jet velocity to stream velocity and the highest ratio of jet pressure to stream pressure. these effects amounted to a slight decrease in fore-drag, a reduction in lift, and a shift of center of pressure in a destabilizing direction.
