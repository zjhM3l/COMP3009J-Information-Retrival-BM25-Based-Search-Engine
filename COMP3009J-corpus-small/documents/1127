the buckling of sandwich type panels. fifty-one flat rectangular sandwich-type panels were tested in edgewise compression with the unloaded edges of the panels restrained by v-grooves. the sandwich consisted of papreg faces and a cellular cellulose acetate core. the thickness of the faces varied from 0.00675 to 0.02025 in.,. the core, from 0.066 to 0.741 in.,. the width of the panel, from 4 to 11 in. the length of the panel was always 10.5 in. the buckled shape consisted of a ripple of short wave length across the panel. it was either symmetric, the two faces bulging out symmetrically according to sine curves, or skew, the two faces deflecting in the same sense according to sine curves having a phase angle of 90. a strain energy theory of buckling is presented for both the symmetric and the skew cases, and the buckling load in the symmetric case is also calculated by integration of the differential equation. the agreement between the theoretic and the experimental buckling stress is reasonable, that between the predicted and actual buckled shape good. a simple formula is developed which permits a choice of the most suitable core material when the mechanical properties of the face material are given.
