heat transfer for laminar flow in an annulus with porous wall. temperature profiles and heat-transfer rates of established incompressible flow through an annulus channel with porous walls of constant temperatures are determined at different injection rates. axial conduction and viscous dissipation are, as usual, neglected. injecting fluid is tacitly assumed to have the same temperature as the porous wall.
