note on creep buckling of columns. this paper describes theory and tests of the creep collapse of long thin aluminum-alloy cylinders under external radial pressure. steady-state creep is assumed in the theoretical derivation. the test temperatures were between 300 and 500 f. the collapse time for each cylinder was calculated theoretically. agreement between theoretical and test results was fair.
