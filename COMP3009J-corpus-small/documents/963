a variational principle for convection of heat. authors extend variational principle of biot to various cases of heat transfer due to forced convection. numerical results are given for one-dimensional problems of fluid flowing between parallel walls with uniform or parabolic velocity profiles. agreement with exact solutions is excellent.
