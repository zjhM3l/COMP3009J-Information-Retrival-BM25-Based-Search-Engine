application of two dimensional vortex theory to the prediction of flow fields behind wings of wing-body combinations at subsonic and supersonic speeds. a theoretical investigation has been made of a general method for predicting the flow field behind the wings of plane and cruciform wing and body combinations at transonic or supersonic speeds and slender configurations at subsonic speeds. the wing trailing-vortex wake is represented initially by line vortices distributed to approximate the spanwise distribution of circulation along the trailing edge of the exposed wing panels. the afterbody is represented by corresponding image vortices within the body. two-dimensional line-vortex theory is then used to compute the induced velocities at each vortex and the resulting displacement of each vortex is determined by means of a numerical stepwise integration procedure. the method was applied to the calculation of the position of the vortex wake and the estimation of downwash at chosen tail locations behind triangular-wing and cylindrical-body combinations at supersonic speeds. the effects of such geometric parameters as aspect ratio, angle of attack and incidence, ratio of body radius to wing semi-span, and angle of bank on the vortex wake behind wings of wing-body combinations were studied. the relative importance of wing vortices, the corresponding image vortices within the body, and body crossflow indetermining the the total downwash was assessed at a possible tail location. it was found that the line-vortex method of this report permitted the calculation of vortex paths behind wings of wing-body combinations with reasonable facility and accuracy. a calculated sample wake shape agreed qualitatively with one observed experimentally, and sample results of the line-vortex method compared well with an available exact crossflow-plane solution. an empirical formula was derived to estimate the number of vortices required per wing panel for a satisfactory computation of downwash at tail locations. it was found that the shape of the vortex wake and the ultimate number of rolled-up vortices behind a wing depend on the circulation distribution along the wing trailing edge. for the low-aspect-ratio plane wing and body combinations considered, it appeared that downwash at horizontal tail locations is largely determined except near the tail-body juncture by the wing vortices alone for small ratios of body radius to wing semispan, and by the body upwash alone for large values of that ratio.
