data on shape and location of detached shock waves in cones and sphere. accurate experimental data are given on the shape and the location of detached shock waves on cones and spheres at mach numbers from 1.17 to 1.81. the data are correlated to obtain equations that describe the shock waves. this knowledge of the shock waves should be useful in calculations of the pressure distribution and the pressure drag of the fore part of cones and spheres. the experimental data on shock waves are compared with theory.
