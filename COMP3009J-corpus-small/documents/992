the effects of a small jet of air exhausting from the nose of a body of revolution in supersonic flow. an investigation has been made at a mach number of 1.62 to determine the effects of a small jet of air exhausting from the nose of an elliptical body of revolution upon boundary-layer transition and the viscous, pressure, and total drag of the forebody at three body stations body nose were also obtained. the tests were conducted at reynolds numbers of 2.13 x 10 and 7.66 x 10, based on body length. the maximum range of thrust coefficients for the small jet was from 0 to about at the lower test reynolds number, for which the boundary layer was laminar over the entire body in the jet-off condition, a very small flow from the jet moved the point of transition forward to the vicinity of the 20-percent-body station. as the jet flow was increased, the transition point moved abruptly to the nose at a thrust coefficient of about gardless of the type of boundary layer. at the higher test reynolds number for which the boundary layer was largely turbulent in the jet-off condition the total drag, including skin friction, was reduced somewhat by the action of the jet. although the forward-exhausting small jet was found to have the above favorable effects upon the drag, these findings are not believed too important since the question arises as to the benefits of the same small jet exhausting from the rear of the body in the conventional manner. no attempt was made to establish geometric optimums in the present investigation, yet, from a general consideration of the benefits indicated by the present results and the phenomena known to occur in the vicinity of rearward-exhausting jets, the benefits of a small jet exhausting rearward would appear to exceed those of the same small jet exhausting forward, particularly so when the flow over the body is laminar in the jet-off condition.
