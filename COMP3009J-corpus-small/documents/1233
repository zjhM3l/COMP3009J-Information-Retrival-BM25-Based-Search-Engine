supersonic shear flow past an airfoil between two parallel walls. the supersonic flow with assigned mach number gradient in the span direction past a straight wing between two parallel walls is studied using the small-disturbance theory. the governing equation for the disturbance pressure on the airfoil, together with the boundary conditions on the airfoil and at the walls, is solved by the method of separation of variables. upon separation the problem is reduced to a sturm-liouville eigenvalue problem and to the solution of the telegraph equation. as an application, a certain mach number profile is selected and the resulting pressure distribution on a parabolic arc airfoil is computed.
