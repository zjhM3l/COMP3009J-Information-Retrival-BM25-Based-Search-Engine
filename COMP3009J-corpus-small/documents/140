the determination of turbulent skin friction by means of pitot tubes. a simple method of determining local turbulent skin friction on a smooth surface has been developed which utilises a round pitot tube resting on the surface. assuming the existence of a region near the surface in which conditions are functions only of the skin friction, the relevant physical constants of the fluid and a suitable length, a universal non-dimensional relation is obtained for the difference between the total pressure recorded by the tube and the static pressure at the wall, in terms of the skin friction. this relation, on this assumption, is independent of the pressure gradient. the truth and form of the relation were first established, to a considerable degree of accuracy, in a pipe using four geometrically similar round pitot tubes--the diameter being taken as representative length. these four pitot tubes were then used to determine the local skin friction coefficient at three stations on a wind tunnel wall, under varying conditions of pressure gradient. at each station, within the limits of experimental accuracy, the deduced skin friction coefficient was found to be the same for each pitot tube, thus confirming the basic assumption and leaving little doubt as to the correctness of the skin friction so found. pitot traverses were then made in the pipe and in the boundary layer on the wind tunnel wall. the results were plotted in two non-dimensional forms on the basis already suggested and they fell close together in a region whose outer limit represented the breakdown of the basic assumption, but close to the wall the results spread out, due to the unknown displacement of the effective centre of a pitot tube near a wall. this again provides further evidence of the existence of a region of local dynamical similarity and of the correctness of the skin friction deduced from measurements with round pitot tubes on the wind tunnel wall. the extent of the region in which the local dynamical similarity may be expected to hold appears to vary from about to of the boundary-layer thickness for conditions remote from, and close to, separation respectively.
