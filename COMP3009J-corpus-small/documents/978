temperature profiles inafinite solid with moving boundary. a numerical solution is presented to the transient heat conduction equation for a cylinder of finite thickness with one moving boundary. the implicit method of solution is developed with conductivity as an arbitrary function of temperature. application is made to a sample case of re-entry heating encountered by aerodynamic bodies, with erosion by sublimation and combustion occurring at the body surface.
