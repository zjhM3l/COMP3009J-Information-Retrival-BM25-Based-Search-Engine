the velocity distribution in the laminar boundary layer between parallel streams. a method is given for obtaining the solution of the laminar boundary layer equations for the steady flow of a stream of viscous incompressible fluid over a parallel stream of different density and viscosity. an approximate solution is also obtained by means of the momentum equation. it is shown that the solutions depend only on the ratio of the velocities of the two streams and on the product of the corresponding density and viscosity ratios. numerical results are given, in the case where the lower fluid is at rest, for four values of and also when for one non-zero value of the velocity ratio.
