a systematic kernel function procedure for determining aerodynamic forces on oscillating or steady finite wings at subsonic speeds. a detailed description is given of a method of approximating solutions to the integral equation that relates oscillatory or steady lift and downwash distributions on finite wings in subsonic flow. the method of solution is applicable to general plan forms with either curved or straight leading and trailing edges. moreover, it is directly applicable to control surfaces such as all-movable tails but modifications are needed to apply it to controls in general. applications of the method involve evaluations of numerous integrals that must be handled by numerical procedures but systematic schemes of evaluations have been adopted that are well suited to the routines of automatic digital computing machines. these schemes of evaluation have been incorporated in a program for an ibm 704 electronic data processing machine. with this machine, a pressure distribution together with such quantities as section or total lift and moment coefficients or generalized forces can be determined for a given value of frequency and mach number and for several /four or five/ modes of oscillation in about 4 minutes of machine time. in the case of steady downwash conditions corresponding quantities can be obtained in about 2 minutes of machine time. in order to illustrate applications of the method, results of several calculations are presented. in these illustrations total forces and moments are compared /1/ with results of analytic procedures for a circular plan form with steady downwash conditions, /2/ with results of other theories and with experiment for a rectangular plan form of aspect ratio 1 at a uniform angle of attack, and /3/ with some experimental results for a rectangular plan form of aspect ratio 2 undergoing pitching and flapping oscillations. also included in the illustrations are results of flutter calculations compared with experimental results for an allmovable control surface of aspect ratio 3.50 and for a cantilevered rectangular plan form of aspect ratio 5.04.
