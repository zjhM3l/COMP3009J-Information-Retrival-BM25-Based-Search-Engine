longitudinal aerodynamic characteristics at low subsonic speeds of a highly swept wing utilizing nose deflection for control. an investigation has been conducted in the langley 7- by 10-foot transonic tunnel at low subsonic speeds to determine the longitudinal aerodynamic characteristics associated with deflection of the nose section of a highly swept delta wing having an aspect ratio of 1.33. in order to illustrate the effectiveness of this forward control, the longitudinal control characteristics are also presented for the wing with upper-and lower-surface split flaps located at the trailing edge. comparison between the longitudinal aerodynamic characteristics of the wing utilizing the nose control and those of the wing utilizing the upper-surface split flap located at the trailing edge indicated similar control effectiveness for high control deflections (15) and similar values of trimmed lift-drag ratio with increasing lift coefficient. use of the nose control, however, indicated a lower value of trimmed angle of attack for a given value of trimmed lift coefficient than that realized from use of the upper-surface split flap. further reductions in trimmed angle of attack for a given value of trimmed lift coefficient may be realized from deflection of the lower-surface split flap at the wing trailing edge in combination with the nose control and would be accompanied by large reductions in lift-drag ratio.
