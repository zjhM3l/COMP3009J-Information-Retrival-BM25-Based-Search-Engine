the influence of two-dimensional stream shear for airfoil maximum lift. the effects of stream velocity gradients on airfoil maximum lift are defined with experimental data obtained in a simulated two-dimensional slipstream. the experimental results show that when positioned near the slipstream plane of symmetry, the airfoil maximum lift varies markedly with location in the slipstream. in moving the airfoil from above to below the slipstream plane of symmetry through a total distance corresponding to the airfoil thickness, force data and boundary-layer observations show that boundary-layer separation is delayed to higher angles of attack, and the airfoil maximum lift is doubled. it is concluded that the destalling effect observed in the non-uniform slipstream is not associated with slipstream boundary interference, but stems from the influence of the large local slipstream shear on airfoil characteristics. the effects of uniform and nonuniform shear on airfoil lift and pressure distribution are discussed, within the framework of existing first-order, small-shear theory, to show that these effects of shear tend to promote stall. a pohlhausen calculation of the laminar boundary layer in a stream with shear is used to identify and to assess the effects of stream shear on boundary-layer separation criteria. it is demonstrated that these effects are negligibly small, and that the uniform-flow criterion applies. it is concluded on the basis of the experimental data that the observed destalling phenomenon stems from a shear effect of higher order than those treated in the inviscid theories. it is hypothesized that it is a second-order effect, fixed by the product of the stream shear and the derivative of the shear, which was large in the present experiments.
