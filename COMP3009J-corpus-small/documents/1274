real gas effects in flow over blunt bodies at hypersonic speeds. a hypersonic shock tunnel has been developed to investigate the aerodynamic characteristics of flow over bodies at conditions comparable to those encountered by ballistic missiles and satellites re-entering the atmosphere. some results for a shock velocity of over 50,000 ft. per sec. in the shock tube portion of the facility are presented. static pressure investigations were made in the nozzle to determine the flow condition and the expansion process. the results of the investigation of representative blunt bodies at hypersonic mach numbers and nozzle stagnation temperatures up to approximately 6,000degreek. are presented. these include body pressure distributions, shock-wave shapes, detachment distances, and photographs of the luminous gas region in the shock layer. it is seen that the shock detachment distance is smaller at higher stagnation temperatures due to the real gas effects. for the hemisphere the pressure distribution was less than that predicted by the modified newtonian theory for all stagnation temperatures. for a 50degree cone-hemisphere the pressure distribution and the shock detachment distance were appreciably affected by the real gas effects. the observed shock-wave shape and the approximate boundary layer on a flat plate are compared with the analytical prediction. some preliminary results for the detached shock wave produced by a blunt two- dimensional body in a low density flow at a mach number of 19.6 are presented
