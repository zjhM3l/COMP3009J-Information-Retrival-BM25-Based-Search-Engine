analysis of effects of diffusion of a foreign gas into the laminar boundary layer of a supersonic flow of air in a tube. adiabatic wall temperatures and recovery factors are calculated for pipe flows with an entrance mach number of 5 and with uniform injection of helium. predicted values of the recovery factor increase slowly with increasing injection rate and with increasing distance from the tube entrance.
