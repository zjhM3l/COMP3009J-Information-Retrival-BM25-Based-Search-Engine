on displacement thickness. four alternative theoretical treatments of 'displacement thickness', and, generally, of the influence of boundary layers and wakes on the flow outside them, are set out, first for two-dimensional, and then for three-dimensional, laminar or turbulent, incompressible flow. they may be called the methods of 'flow reduction', 'equivalent sources', 'velocity comparison' and the principal expression obtained for the displacement thickness in three-dimensional flow may be written if, as orthogonal coordinates (x,y) specifying position on the surface, we choose x as the velocity potential of the external flow, and y as a coordinate, constant along the external-flow streamlines, such that h dy is the distance between (x,y) and z is the distance from the surface, u and v are the x and y components of velocity, and u takes the value u just outside the boundary layer.
