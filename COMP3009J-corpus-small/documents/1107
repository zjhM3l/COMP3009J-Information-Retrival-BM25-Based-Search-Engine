the flow field over blunted flat plates and its effect on turbulent boundary growth and heat transfer at a mach number of 4. 7. surface pressures, impact and static pressure distributions in the flow field over the plate, and local heating rates were measured on a flat plate with various leading-edge diameters. the tests were conducted at a mach number of 4.7 and a free-stream reynolds number of 3.8x10 per foot. it was found that the shape of the shock wave indicated the existence of an outward deflection of the flow over the plate. the flow deflection caused an outward deflection of the shock-wave asymptote of approximately the shock-wave angle calculated including boundary-layer growth. the mach number distributions in the shear layer evaluated from pitot and static pressure surveys agreed with predictions based on shock-wave shape. the predicted turbulent heat-transfer coefficients for the blunted flat plates agreed with the measured heat-transfer coefficients. a comparison between the measured heat-transfer coefficients for the blunted flat plates and the calculated coefficients for a sharp leading-edged plate indicated that the coefficients were highest near the leading edge of the most blunted plate. the measured heat-transfer coefficients dropped to approximately 80 percent of the sharp-plate values at a considerable distance from the leading edge for all of the blunted flat plates.
