boundary layer measurements in hypersonic flow. experimental data are presented on boundary-layer formation, heat transfer, and skin-friction coefficient at mach numbers of the wall of a conical nozzle in the presence of a favorable pressure gradient and several rates of heat transfer. the reynolds number based on momentum thickness varied from 1,500 to 3,500. comparison is made with data at lower mach numbers and with the semiempirical theory of von karman. the existing data up to mach numbers of nine indicate agreement to within 5 per cent when compared with a form of the wilson theory, but it is clear that the effects of heat transfer and pressure gradients present problems which require extensive study and experiment in the future.
