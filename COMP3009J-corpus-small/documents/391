flutter of rectangular simply supported panels at high supersonic speeds. the problem of panel flutter of rectangular simply supported plates subjected to supersonic flow over one surface is treated theoretically. the assumption is made, and subsequently verified, that the /static/ approximation to the aerodynamic flutter forces yields flutter boundaries with satisfactory accuracy for mach numbers greater than about 2. two panel flutter analyses are performed using this static approximation in conjunction with thin-plate theory--one employs aerodynamic strip theory, the other aerodynamic surface theory. the influence of mach number, dynamic pressure, panel aspect ratio, and midplane stress on the panel thickness required to prevent flutter is determined for extensive ranges of these parameters.
