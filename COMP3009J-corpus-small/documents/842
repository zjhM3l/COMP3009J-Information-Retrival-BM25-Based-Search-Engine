an improvement on donnell's approximation for thin-walled circular cylinders. donnell's equation for thin-walled circular cylinders is replaced by where w is a non-dimensional form of the radial displacement and q is the distributed radial loading. this equation retains the essential simplicity of the original but, unlike donnell's equation, the accuracy does not decrease as the wavelength of circumferential distortion increases.
