the effect of axial constraint on the instability of thin conical shells under external pressure. author considers elastic axial restraint which may be (1) active from the beginning of loading and (2) active only at the onset of buckling. buckling loads for the two cases are related by a simple conversion factor. effect of the restraint on the axisymmetric type buckling is negligible, but the amplification of the critical load for the nonaxisymmetric type buckling may be very large for type (1) restraint. design curves are included for a range of l d.and restraint stiffness. results are of doubtful value considering the known inadequacy of the linear theory of buckling under axial compression.
