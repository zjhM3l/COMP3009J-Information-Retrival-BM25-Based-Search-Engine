an extension of the method of generalised conical flows for lifting wings in supersonic flow. the method of generalised conical flows has previously been developed subject to the condition that the upwash divided by the streamwise co-ordinate to the power k, where k is the order of the conical flow, must have vanishing (k+1)th derivative with respect to the conical co-ordinate. in the present note this restriction is removed. the results are also used to discuss the effect of the application of the leading edge attachment condition on the wing pressure and geometry.
