shock wave effects on the laminar skin friction of an insulated flat plate at hypersonic speeds. an approximate theory on the phenomena of interaction between the shock wave and the laminar boundary layer on an insulated flat plate at hypersonic speeds has been formulated. results on the rate of growth of the boundary-layer thickness and the rate of decay of the shock-wave strength have been found that hold for. a new set of formulas for the average skin-friction coefficient, over an insulated flat plate at hypersonic speeds has been obtained. calculations on the basis of the new formulas yield the data shown in figs. steady decrease in as increases, the present results indicate that may increase with at hypersonic mach numbers.
