note on the convergence of numerical solutions of the navier-stokes equations. a criterion is given for the convergence of numerical solutions of the navier-stokes equations in two dimensions under steady conditions. the criterion applies to all cases of steady viscous flow in two dimensions and shows that if the local 'mesh reynolds number', based on the size of the mesh used in the solution, exceeds a certain fixed value, the numerical solution will not converge.
