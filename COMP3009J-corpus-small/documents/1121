compressive and torsional buckling of thin-wall cylinders in the yield region. based on assumptions which have led to the best agreement between theory and test data on inelastic buckling of flat plates, a general set of equilibrium differential equations for the plastic buckling of cylinders has been derived. these equations have been used to obtain solutions for the compressive and torsional buckling of long cylinders in the yield region. test data are presented which indicate satisfactory agreement with the theoretical plasticity-reduction factors in most cases. where a difference in results exists, test data are in substantially better agreement with the results obtained by use of the maximum-shear law rather than the octahedral-shear law to transform axial stress-strain data to shear stress-strain data.
