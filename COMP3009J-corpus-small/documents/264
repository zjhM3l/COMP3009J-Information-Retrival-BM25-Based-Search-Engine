asymptotic solution of the two dimensional oscillating aerofoil problem for high subsonic mach numbers. a new method has been given, for obtaining asymptotic solutions of a boundary value problem for the wave equation. the method is simpler than the method previously given by burger, and leads to a result identical with burger's result.
