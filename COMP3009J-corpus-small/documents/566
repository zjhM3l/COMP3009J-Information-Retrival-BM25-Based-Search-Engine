investigation of local heat transfer and pressure drag characteristics of a yawed circular cylinder at supersonic speeds. local heat-transfer coefficients, temperature recovery factors, and pressure distributions were measured on a circular cylinder at a nominal mach number of 3.9 over a range of free-stream reynolds numbers from from 0 to 44. it was found that yawing the cylinder reduced the local heat-transfer coefficients, the average heat-transfer coefficients, and the pressure drag coefficients over the front side of the cylinder. for example, at is reduced by 34 percent and the pressure drag by 60 percent. the amount of reduction may be predicted by a theory presented herein. local temperature recovery factors were also reduced by yaw, but the amount of reduction is small compared to the reduction in heat-transfer coefficients. a comparison of these data with other data obtained under widely different conditions of body and stream temperature, mach number, and reynolds number indicates that these factors have little effect upon the dropoff of heat transfer due to yaw.
