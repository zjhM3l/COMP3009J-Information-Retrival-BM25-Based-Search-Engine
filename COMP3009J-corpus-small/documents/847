experimental study of the vibrations of a circular cylindrical shell. an apparatus is described which permits the mode shape of a vibrating circular cylindrical shell to be obtained quite easily. these measurements are made without contacting the cylinder and can be converted to actual lineal values. a representative number of results obtained with such a system are shown to illustrate the relationship between the nodal pattern and frequency in a cylinder as well as the effect of internal pressure on these frequencies. finally, comparisons are made between these results and timoshenko theory and an appropriate shell theory.
