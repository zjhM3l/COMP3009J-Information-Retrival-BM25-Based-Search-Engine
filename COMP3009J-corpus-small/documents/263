cylindrical shock waves produced by instantaneous energy release. taylor's analysis of the intense spherical explosion has been extended to the cylindrical case. it is found that the radius r of a strong cylindrical shock wave produced by a sudden release of energy e per unit length grows with time t according to the equation where is the atmospheric density and is a calculated function of the specific heat ratio. for is found to be approximately unity. for this case, the pressure behind the shock wave decays with radius r according to the relation. applying the results of this analysis to the case of hypersonic flight, it can be shown that the shock envelope behind a meteor or a high-speed missile is approximately a paraboloid given by where d and v denote the total drag and the velocity of the missile, respectively, and x is the distance behind the missile.
