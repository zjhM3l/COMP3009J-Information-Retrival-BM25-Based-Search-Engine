the buckling shear stress of simply-supported infinitely long plates with transverse stiffeners. this report is an extension of previous theoretical investigations of the elastic buckling in shear of flat plates reinforced by transverse stiffeners. the plates are treated as infinitely long and simply-supported along the long sides. stiffeners are spaced at regular intervals, dividing the plate into a number of panels of uniform size. the effect ob bending and torsional stiffnesses of the stiffener upon the buckling shear stress is calculated for the complete range of stiffnesses, for panels with ratios of width to stiffener spacing of graphical forms.
