use of freon-12 as a fluid for aerodynamic testing. the thermodynamic properties of freon-12 have been investigated to determine the possibilities of the use of this gas as a fluid for aerodynamic testing. the values of velocity of sound in freon-12, which are less than one-half those in air, are presented as functions of temperatures and pressure, including measurements at room temperature. the density of freon-12 is about four times that of air. changes in state of freon-12 may be predicted by means of the ideal gas law with an accuracy of better than 1 percent at pressures below freon-12 is shown not to condense during an adiabatic expansion from normal conditions up to a mach number of 3. the values of the ratio of specific heats for freon-12 are lower than that for air, and therefore an additional parameter is introduced, which must be considered when comparisons are made of aerodynamic tests using freon-12 with those using air. the time lag of the vibrational heat capacity of freon-12 to a change in temperature has been measured and found to be of the order of 2 x 10 second at atmospheric temperature and pressure. this time is so short that no important energy dissipations should result in most engineering applications.
