a simple method for calculating the span and chordwise loading on straight and swept wings of any aspect ratio at subsonic speeds. the methods of the classical aerofoil theory are used to derive a general theory for wings of any given planform. the load over the whole surface of a given wing can be calculated at a given subcritical mach number, and the procedure is as simple and rapid as that of the classical aerofoil theory. the calculated results are confirmed by experiments.
