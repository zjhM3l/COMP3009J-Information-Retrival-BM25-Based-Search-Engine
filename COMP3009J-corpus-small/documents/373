the generalized expansion method and its application to bodies travelling at high supersonic airspeeds. it is demonstrated that the shock-expansion method can be generalized to treat a large class of hypersonic flows, only one of which is flow about airfoils. this generalized method predicts the whole flow field, including shock-wave curvatures and resulting vorticity, providing that (1) disturbances originating on the surface of an object are largely absorbed in shock waves with which they interact and (2) disturbances associated with the divergence of stream lines in tangent planes to the surface are of secondary importance compared to those associated with the curvature of stream lines in planes normal to the surface. it is shown that these conditions may be met in three-dimensional as well as two-dimensional hypersonic flows. when they are met, surface streamlines may be taken as geodesics, which, in turn, may be related to the geometry of the surface. the validity of the generalized shock-expansion method for three-dimensional hypersonic flows is checked by comparing predictions of theory with experiment for the surface pressures and bow shock waves of bodies of revolution. the bodies treated are two ogives having fineness ratios of 3 and 5. tests were conducted at mach numbers from 2.7 to 6.3 and angles of attack up to 15 degrees in the 10- by 14-in. supersonic wind tunnel of the ames aeronautical laboratory. at the lower angles of attack, theory and experiment approach agreement when the ratio of mach number to fineness ratio--that is, the hypersonic similarity parameter--exceeds 1. at the larger angles of attack, theory tends to break down, as would be expected, on the leeward sides of the bodies. as a final point, it is inquired if the two-dimensionality of inviscid hypersonic flows has any counterpart in hypersonic boundary-layer flows. the question is answered in the affirmative, and results of experiment are employed to provide a partial check of this conclusion.
