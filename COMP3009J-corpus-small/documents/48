supersonic flow at the surface of a circular cone at angle of attack. formulas for the inviscid flow properties on the surface of a cone at angle of attack are derived for use in conjunction with the m.i.t. cone tables. these formulas are based upon an entropy distribution on the cone surface which is uniform and equal to that of the shocked fluid in the windward meridian plane. they predict values for the flow variables which may differ significantly from the corresponding values obtained directly from the cone tables. the differences in the magnitudes of the flow variables computed by the two methods tend to increase with increasing free-stream mach number, cone angle and angle of attack.
