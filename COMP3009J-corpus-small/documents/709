static longitudinal aerodynamic characteristics at transonic speeds and angles of attack up to 99degree of a reentry glider having folding wingtip panels. data are presented which were obtained from a transonic wind-tunnel investigation of a reentry glider having folding wing-tip panels. the tests were conducted at angles of attack from -4degrees to 99degrees. the reynolds number based on the mean geometric chord of the fixed planform varied from 2.35 x 10 to 2.99 x 10. the maximum lift-drag ratio for the model with the folding wing-tip panels fully extended decreased from a maximum value of 7.8 at a mach number of 0.60 to about 3.4 at mach numbers from 1.03 to 1.20. the model with the folding wing panels fully extended was stable for values of the lift coefficient from 0 up to at least 0.8. above this lift coefficient pitch-up tendencies were observed, followed by an unstable or neutrally stable region which extended up to values of angle of attack of 50degrees or 60degrees. deflecting the folding wing panels between ducing a significant change in the trim angle of attack or in any of the force or moment coefficients in the angle-of-attack range from 49degree to 99degree.
