effects of stage characteristics and matching on axial flow compressor performance. the use of stage characteristics obtained from test data in the performance analysis and development of an axial-flow compressor is described relative stage matching as shown by an idealized example and also by test experience. factors governing major performance parameters are discussed and certain development problems and possible solutions are reviewed.
