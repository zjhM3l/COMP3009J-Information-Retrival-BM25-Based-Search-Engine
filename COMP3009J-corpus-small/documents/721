near noise field of a jet engine exhaust. aircraft structures located in the near noise field of a jet engine are subjected to extremely high fluctuating pressures that may cause structural fatigue. studies of such structures have been limited by lack of knowledge of the loadings involved. the acoustic near field produced by the exhaust of a stationary turbojet engine having a high pressure ratio was measured for a single operating condition without afterburning. the maximum over-all sound pressure without afterburning was found to be about 42 pounds per square foot along the jet boundary in the region immediately downstream of the jet-nozzle exit. with afterburning the maximum sound pressure was increased by 50 percent. the largest sound pressures without afterburning were obtained on a constant percentage band width basis in the frequency range from 350 to 700 cps. additional tests were made at a few points to find the effect of jet velocity on near-field sound pressures and to determine the difference in value between sound-pressure levels at rigid surfaces and corresponding free-field values. near the jet nozzle, over-all sound pressures were found to vary as a low power (approx. unity) of the jet velocity. over-all sound-pressure levels considerably greater than the corresponding free-field levels were recorded at the surface of a rigid plate placed along the jet boundary. the downstream locations of the maximum sound pressure at any given frequency along the jet-engine-exhaust boundary and the longitudinal turbulent-velocity maximum of the same frequency along a small cold-air jet at 1 nozzle-exit radius from the jet axis were found to be nearly the same when compared on a dimensionless basis. also, the strouhal number of the corresponding spectra maximums was found to be nearly equal at similar distances downstream. in addition to the magnitude and frequency distribution of the acoustic pressures, it is necessary to know the cross correlation of the pressure over the surface area. cross-correlation measurements with microphones were made for a range of jet velocities at locations along the jet and at a distance from the jet. free-field correlations of the over-all sound pressure and of the sound pressure in frequency bands from 100 to 1000 cps were obtained both longitudinally and laterally. in addition, correlations were obtained with microphones mounted at the surface of a rigid plate that was large compared with the distance over which a positive correlation existed. the region of positive correlation was generally found to increase with distance downstream of the engine to 6.5 nozzle-exit diameters, but remained nearly constant thereafter. in general, little change in the correlation curves was found as a function of jet velocity or frequency-band width. the distance from unity correlation to the first zero correlation was greater for lateral than for longitudinal correlations for the same conditions and locations. the correlation curves obtained in free space and on the surface of the plate were generally similar. the results are interpreted in terms of pressure loads on surfaces.
