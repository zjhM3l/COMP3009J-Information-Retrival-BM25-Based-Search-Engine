analysis of stress at several junctions in pressurized shells. theoretical and experimental results are presented for the discontinuity stresses arising at a change of wall thickness in a cylinder, a cylinder-hemisphere junction, and a cone-spherical torus junction in pressure vessels. the effect of mismatch of nonconcurrence of the middle surfaces of two joined cylinders is considered. in addition, a cylinder with a special closure which has considerably reduced stresses is described, and curves with theoretical and experimental stresses are presented.
