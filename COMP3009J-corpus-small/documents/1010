free-flight measurements of the static and dynamic. air-flow properties in nozzles were calculated and charted for equilibrium flow and two types of frozen flows. in one type of frozen flow, air was assumed to be in equilibrium from the nozzle reservoir to arbitrary points where chemical reactions and molecular vibrations became frozen. in the other type, it was assumed that molecular vibrations were in equilibrium throughout the nozzle and that chemical reactions became frozen at arbitrary points. the calculations were made for a range of stagnation pressures up to 10,000 poinds per square inch absolute and stagnation enthalpies up to 24,500 btu per pound. the flow properties charted were temperature, pressure, density, velocity, dynamic pressure, mach number, reynolds number, molecular weight fraction, and mass flow. equilibrium flow properties through normal shock waves were also included.
