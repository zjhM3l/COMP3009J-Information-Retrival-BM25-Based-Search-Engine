boundary layer induced noise in the interior of aircraft. at high speeds the turbulent boundary layer washing the airplane fuselage excites appreciable skin vibration, promoting strong noise in the interior. the fluctuating exciting pressure distribution can be represented as a pattern of moving waves (fourier integral). a running ripple in the skin follows underneath each wave, and the noise is ultimately due to these ripples. the acoustic effects of the running ripples are calculated for an infinite sheet,. this is considered the main result of the paper. supersonically moving ripples radiate strong sound in the form of mach waves,. subsonically moving ripples radiate no sound. formulas for the mean square surface pressure and the energy flux are obtained for an assumed idealized turbulent pressure spectrum. the results are adapted to provide a tentative estimate of the noise generated at subsonic speeds in a practical fuselage. the running ripples are almost noise-free, but multiple reflections at the frames and stringers promote standing waves. an assumption is used to link the two kinds of waves, and this leads to provisional calculations of noise level.. on this basis the noise level is predicted to vary as for thin boundary layers, changing progressively to for thick layers ( = external air density, = speed, = layer thickness, = panel thickness). some comparisons are made with experiment. finally, an idea for minimizing the noise is presented.
