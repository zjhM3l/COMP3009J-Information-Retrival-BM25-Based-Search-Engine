viscous effects on pitot tubes at low speeds. measurements were made of the pressure in a blunt-nosed pitot tube, in an air stream at reynolds numbers from about 15 to 1000. the results are expressed in terms of a pressure coefficient density of the fluid, and p and v are the static pressure and velocity in the undisturbed stream. as found in previous investigations, becomes greater than 1 at low reynolds numbers, the increase being about at a reynolds number of 50 (based on external tube radius). in disagreement with the work of hurd, chesky, and shapiro, no decrease of below 1 was found at any reynolds number. when the values of found by various experiments are plotted against reynolds numbers based on internal tube radius, it is found that the curves are in closer agreement than when the external radius is used.
