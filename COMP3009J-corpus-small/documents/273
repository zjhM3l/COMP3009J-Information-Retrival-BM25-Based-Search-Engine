flow past slender blunt bodies - a review and extension. a numerical solution of the inviscid flow field about slender blunt bodies of revolution has been developed through a combination of two methods.. the van dyke solution in the subsonic flow region at the nose, and the method of characteristics in the supersonic region. the results are compared with second-order blast wave theory and with experimental data,. and the respective merits and deficiencies of the two theoretical methods are pointed out. the results of the numerical solution are further used in a discussion of the entropy layer, to propose a possible criterion of entropy layer thickness.
