principles of creep buckling weight-strength analysis. the determination of column deflections and column buckling loads has been considered for many years. the available theories, however, do not provide for materials which creep with time under constant loads. for the design of structural members made of these materials, a consideration of creep may be of practical importance. plastics, concrete, and some metals creep at normal temperatures while other metals creep only at high temperatures and at stress values beyond the yield point. a consideration of creep in the design of some structures appears appropriate in view of the modern developments in plastics and the presence of high stress values which are sometimes beyond the yield stress. this paper gives a rational theory for predicting creep deflections in columns. a special case using this theory is applied to the interpretation of some preliminary tests of an aluminum alloy.
