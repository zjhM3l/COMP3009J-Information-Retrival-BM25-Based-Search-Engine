an investigation of the noise produced by a subsonic air jet. to investigate the theoretical predictions of lighthill on aerodynamic sound, measurements have been made of the sound field of a 1 in. air jet issuing from a long pipe. the measurements have been made over a wide frequency band (30 to 10,000 cycles/sec.) and in one-third octave bands in this frequency range. the mean mach number at the pipe orifice was varied from 0.3 to 1.0. the dependence of the apparent position of the noise sources on frequency and jet speed was investigated. at a given frequency a source is situated farther from the jet orifice the higher the jet speed. lower frequency sources appear farther downstream than ones of higher frequency, consistent with their association with larger eddies. the directional characteristics of the sound field at different frequencies and jet speeds are illustrated by means of scale diagrams showing lines of constant sound intensity. these sound fields are analyzed in terms of the moving quadrupole sources of lighthill's theory and good agreement obtained. it is shown that the apparent spread of the sources at low frequencies is due to the doppler effect. at low frequency relative to the frequency of maximum power output) the radiation is predominantly that of three mutually orthogonal longitudinal quadrupoles which, except for the effect of convection upon it, has a sound field like a monopole source. at higher frequencies the sound fields of lateral and longitudinal quadrupoles predominate.
