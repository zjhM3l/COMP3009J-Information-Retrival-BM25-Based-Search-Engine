principles of creep buckling weight-strength analysis. the relation of the time-dependent tangent-modulus load--as conceived by shanley--to actual column capacity is clarified. it may be interpreted as a limiting case of the conservative estimate. the time-dependent tangent-modulus load is, therefore, an approximation to a conservative estimate. the approximation, however, may be either conservative or nonconservative when applied to imperfect or real columns. typical cases are discussed and experimental results for two alloys are cited.
