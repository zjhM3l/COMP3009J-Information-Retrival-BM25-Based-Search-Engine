the behaviour of thin cylindrical shells after buckling under axial compression. the fundamental investigations of von karman and tsien on the buckling of cylindrical shells under axial compression are continued. the energy expression is simplified and minimized with respect to the axial and circumferential wave-length parameters. solution of the equations obtained yields curves of the reduced average stress and of the wave dimensions plotted against the reduced average strain. they illustrate the behavior of the cylinder during the buckling process. the minimum buckling stress is found to be 0.195e(tr).
