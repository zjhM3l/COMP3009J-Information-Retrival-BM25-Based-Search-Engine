note on creep buckling of columns. the general dynamic equation of creep bending of a beam loaded laterally and axially was derived for a linearly viscoelastic material whose mechanical properties can be characterized by four parameters. the material can exhibit instantaneous and retarded elasticity as well as pure flow. the equation derived was used to obtain the creep bending deflection of a beam in pure bending and of a column with initial sinusoidal deviation from straightness. as expected, the ratio of the creep deflections of the beam in pure bending and the deflections of a corresponding purely elastic structure is identical to the ratio of the creep strain and the corresponding elastic strain of a bar under simple tension or compression. the results of the analysis of the creep deflection of the column showed that the deflections increase continuously with time and become infinitely large only when the loading time is correspondingly large. however, large deflections are obtained in reasonably short periods of time if the applied load is near to the euler load of the column. the deflection-time curves obtained from a numerical example are of the same type as those determined by experiment with aluminum columns.
