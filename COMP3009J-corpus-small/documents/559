heat transfer at the forward stagnation point of blunt bodies. relations are presented for the calculation of heat transfer at the forward stagnation point of both two-dimensional and axially symmetric blunt bodies. the relations for the heat transfer, which were obtained from exact solutions to the equations of the laminar boundary layer, are presented in terms of the local velocity gradient at the stagnation point. these exact solutions include effects of variation of fluid properties, prandtl number, and transpiration cooling. examples illustrating the calculation procedure are also included.
