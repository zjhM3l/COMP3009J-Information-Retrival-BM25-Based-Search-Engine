the flow around oscillating low aspect ratio wings at transonic speeds. when certain conditions are fulfilled for thickness ratio, aspect ratio, and reduced frequency for a three-dimensional wing, it can be shown that the partial differential equation for the non-steady perturbation potential can be reduced to a comparatively simple linear equation. the solution is then obtained by applying a fourier transformation in the free-stream direction and then using an iterative process developed by adams and sears for steady flow. the method gives solutions valid for low combinations of aspect ratio and reduced frequency. the method is applied to a delta wing oscillating in some selected rigid and elastic modes. from the results it can be seen that the special non-steady forces in the potential equation, which are neglected in slender-body theory, are very important. stability derivatives can also be obtained by the method and it is seen that the damping in pitch may be negative at m 1 for delta wings of too high aspect ratio.
