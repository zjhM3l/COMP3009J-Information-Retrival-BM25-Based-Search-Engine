an integral equation relating the general time-dependent lift and downwash distributions on finite wings in subsonic flow. an integral equation for obtaining the unsteady air forces on finite wings in subsonic compressible flow is presented. this equation is applicable for any arbitrary time-dependent motion and can be utilized for flexible as well as rigid wings. the approach involves the derivation of an integral equation relating the unknown pressure the form of the equation is such that it should lend itself readily to modern high-speed computers for obtaining pressure distributions. special cases of the integral equation are treated for two-dimensional incompressible flow and are presented in an appendix.
