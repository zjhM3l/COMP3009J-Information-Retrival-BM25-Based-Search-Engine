the production of aerodynamic forces by heat addition on external surfaces of aircraft. within the framework of linearized flow theory an equivalence between a fluid mass source, a heat source, and streamwise body forces is developed. the equivalence between the fluid mass source and heat source was first noticed by hicks(2) and later by chu. (3) using the equivalence the flow field produced by heat addition and by magnetohydrodynamical body forces can be computed. examples for a two-dimensional flat plate, a delta wing, an axially symmetric slender body, and a wedge-shaped afterbody are computed at subsonic and supersonic speeds. the efficiency of lift or thrust production by surface heat addition is very low at subsonic speeds. at supersonic speeds the efficiency is compared with the efficiency of a conventional turbojet-powered aircraft configuration. it is found that the efficiency of lift or thrust production by heat addition on two-dimensional bodies is approximately the same as that for a turbojet-powered two-dimensional body. the efficiency is somewhat higher at low supersonic mach numbers and behaves as, decreasing to a constant value as increases. on the other hand, the efficiency of thrust production by heat addition increases linearly with mach number when heat is added on the rear surface of an axially symmetric afterbody of parabolic shape.
