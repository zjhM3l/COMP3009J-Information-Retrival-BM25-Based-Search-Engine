general theory of airfoil sections having arbitrary shape or pressure distribution. in this report a theory of thin airfoils of small camber is developed which permits either the velocity distribution corresponding to a given airfoil shape, or the airfoil shape corresponding to a given velocity distribution to be calculated. the procedures to be employed in these calculations are outlined and illustrated with suitable examples.
