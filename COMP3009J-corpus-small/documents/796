an investigation at transonic speeds of the performance of various distributed roughness bands used to cause boundary layer transition near the leading edge of a cropped delta half-wing. distributed roughness bands of no.320 and no.500 carborundum were found to be effective in causing boundary-layer transition if they extended over the first 5( and 10( respectively of the local chord. use of larger grain sizes, or increases in the band width for a given grain size resulted in a drag penalty. with very large particle sizes /about between the particles. the drag penalty was constant over the test mach number range /0.80 to 1.15/ and decreased slowly with incidence. the wing lift and pitching moment were only slightly modified by the presence of any of the roughness bands tested, but this result would not of course necessarily apply to wings of other planforms or section shapes. the test reynolds number was about 2.7 million. in the appendix, the structure of the roughness bands is discussed, as well as the details of the materials used and the techniques used to apply the band.
