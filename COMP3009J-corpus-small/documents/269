on a laminar free-convection flow and heat transfer of electrically conducting fluid on a vertical flat plate in the presence of a transverse magnetic field. the free-convection flow and heat transfer of an electrically conducting fluid on a vertical plate in the presence of a transverse magnetic field is analysed for a magnetic field fixed to the electrically non-conducting wall. the boundary layer equations for self-preserving flows are integrated numerically for the prandtl number of unity, and the effect of the transverse magnetic field on the velocity profile, temperature profile and rate of heat transfer is discussed. it is concluded that the heat transfer rate is reduced as the magnetic field intensity is increased.
