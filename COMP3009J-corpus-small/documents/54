method for calculation of compressible laminar boundary layer characteristics in axial pressure gradient with zero heat transfer. the karman-pohlhausen method is extended primarily to sixth-degree velocity profiles for determining the characteristics of the compressible laminar boundary layer over an adiabatic wall in the presence of an axial pressure gradient. it is assumed that the prandtl number is unity and that the coefficient of viscosity varies linearly with the temperature. a general approximate solution which permits a rapid determination of the boundary-layer characteristics for any given free-stream mach number and given velocity distribution at the outer edge of the boundary layer is obtained. numerical examples indicate that this solution will in practice lead to results of satisfactory accuracy, including the critical reynolds number for stability. for the special purpose of calculating the location of the separation point in an adverse pressure gradient, a short and simple method, based on the use of a seventh-degree velocity profile, is derived. the numerical example given here indicates that this method should in practice lead to sufficiently accurate results. for the special case of flow near a forward stagnation point it is shown that the karman-pohlhausen method with the usual fourth-degree profiles leads to results of adequate accuracy, even for the critical reynolds number.
