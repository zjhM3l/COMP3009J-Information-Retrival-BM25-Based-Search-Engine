the 7 in. x 7 in. hypersonic wind tunnel at r.a.e. farnborough part ii. heater performance. tests on the storage heater, which is cylindrical in form and mounted horizontally, show that its performance is adequate for operation at m=6.8 and probably adequate for flows at m=8.2 with the existing nozzles. in its present state, the maximum design temperature of 680 degrees centigrade for operation at m=9 cannot be realised in the tunnel because of heat loss to the outlet attachments of the heater and quick-acting valve which form, in effect, a large heat sink. because of this heat loss there is rather poor response of stagnation temperature in the working section at the start of a run. it is hoped to cure this by preheating the heater outlet cone and the quick-acting valve. at pressures greater than about 100 p.s.i.g. free convection through the fibrous thermal insulation surrounding the heated core causes the top of the heater shell to become somewhat hotter than the bottom, which results in /hogging/ distortion of the shell. this free convection cools the heater core and a vertical temperature gradient is set up across it after only a few minutes at high pressure. modifications to be incorporated in the heater to improve its performance are described.
