the wake behind an oscillating vehicle. the incompressible laminar far wake behind an oscillating vehicle is analyzed with the use of the oseen linearization, and the assumption that the wake cross section is axisymmetric. time-wise drag variations are thus represented as changes in the wake diameter and velocity defect. it is shown that the unsteadiness in this flow can be predicted by a quasi-steady theory.
