boundary layer transition and heat transfer in shock tubes. an experimental study is made of the wall boundary layer in a shock tube operated over a wide range of shock mach numbers and pressure levels in air, including those for which real-gas effects exist. transition distances are determined and correlated in terms of the transition reynolds number based on a characteristic length for this boundary layer. data from independent shock-tube studies are also included in this correlation. the results indicate a weak dependence of transition reynolds number on shock strength up to moderate values of shock mach number, followed by a larger stabilizing tendency. comparison of these data with transition data obtained in the same manner in argon indicate that the increased cooling rates are largely responsible for the stabilization. a dependence of transition reynolds number on the unit reynolds number is found at the lower shock strengths. specifically, higher transition reynolds numbers are achieved at larger unit reynolds numbers. the phenomenon of transition reversal does not appear within the range of the experiments reported. laminar- and turbulent-flow heat-transfer rates to the walls of the shock tube are determined experimentally. the results of the heat-transfer measurements substantiate existing theories in both the laminar- and turbulent-flow regimes.
