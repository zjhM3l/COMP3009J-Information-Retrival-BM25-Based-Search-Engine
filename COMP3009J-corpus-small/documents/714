blockage corrections for three-dimensional flow closed throat wind tunnels, with considerations of the effect of compressibility. theoretical blockage corrections are presented for a body of revolution and for a three-dimensional unswept wing in a circular or rectangular wind tunnel. the theory takes account of the effects of the wake and of the compressibility of the fluid, and is based on the assumption that the dimensions of the model are small in comparison with those of the tunnel throat. formulas are given for correcting a number of the quantities, such as dynamic pressure and mach number, measured in wind-tunnel tests. the report presents a summary and unification of the existing literature on the subject.
