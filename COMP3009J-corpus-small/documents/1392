the solution of small displacement, stability or vibration problems concerning a flat rectangular panel when the edges are either clamped or simply supported. this report describes an energy method for the exact solution of problems concerning the small displacements, stability or vibration of a flat rectangular panel when the edges are either clamped or simply supported. the influence of stiffeners which are parallel to one pair of edges, and situated in pairs on opposite sides of the panel so that the neutral axis of each stiffener pair lies in the middle surface of the panel, is taken into account. the method is not only applicable to isotropic panels but also to aeolotropic panels when the material of the panel has two directions of elastic symmetry parallel to the edges. the final solution of the problems depends on an infinite set of linear equations for small displacement problems or on an infinite determinantal equation for stability and vibration problems. the important feature of the analysis given is that it enables a direct approach to be made to these equations in any particular problem. it is not in general possible to obtain a direct solution of the final equations and it is necessary to approximate and consider a finite set of linear equations or a finite determinantal equation derived from the more important terms in the analytical expression for the transverse displacement of the panel. here, physical intuition and, if available, experimental data serve as a guide and the accuracy of the final results so obtained is gauged by the rate of convergence with the increase in the number of terms considered. the general method of solution is applied first to the free vibration of a square panel when all the edges are clamped, and second to the buckling of a square panel under shear when three edges are clamped and one edge is simply supported.
