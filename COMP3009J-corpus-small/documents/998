equations, tables and charts for compressible flow. this report, which is a revision and extension of naca tn useful in the analysis of high-speed flow of a compressible fluid. the equations provide relations for continuous one-dimensional flow, normal and oblique shock waves, and prandtl-meyer expansions for both perfect and imperfect gases. the tables present useful dimensionless ratios for continuous one- dimensional flow and for normal shock waves as functions of mach number for air considered as a perfect gas. one series of charts presents the characteristics of the flow of air (considered a perfect gas) for oblique shock waves and for cones in a supersonic air stream. a second series shows the effects of caloric imperfections on continuous one-dimensional flow and on the flow through normal and oblique shock waves.
