navier-stokes solutions at large distances from a finite body. this paper is concerned with a theoretical investigation of the flow field at large distances from an object moving through a viscous fluid. the discussion will be restricted to the case of two-dimensional stationary incompressible flow. the object will be assumed to be of finite size. the domain of the fluid is infinite and it is assumed that there are no other boundaries for the fluid except that of the given object. the reynolds number will be assumed to have a fixed value., thus we shall not consider the limiting cases of the reynolds number tending to zero or to infinity.
