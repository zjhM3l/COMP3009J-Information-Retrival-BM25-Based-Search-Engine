study of flow conditions and deflection angle at exit of two-dimensional cascade of turbine rotor blades at critical and supercritical pressure ratios. an analysis was made of the flow conditions downstream of a cascade of turbine rotor blades at critical and supercritical pressure ratios. the results of five theoretical methods for determining the deflection angle are compared with those of an experimental method using the conservation-of-momentum principle and static-pressure surveys, and also are compared with an analysis of schlieren photographs of the flow downstream of the blades. a two- dimensional cascade of six blades with an axial width of 1.80 inches was used for the static-pressure surveys and for some of the schlieren photographs. in order to determine the flow conditions several blade chords downstream of the cascade, schlieren photographs were taken of the flow through a cascade of 18 blades having an axial width of 0.60 inch. for the blade design studied, even at static-to-total pressure ratios considerably lower than that required to give critical velocity at the throat section, the flow was deflected in the tangential direction as predicted for the incompressible case. as the pressure ratio was lowered further, the aerodynamic loading of the rear portion of the blade reached a maximum value and remained constant. after this condition was attained, the expansion downstream of the cascade took place with a constant tangential velocity so that no further increase in the amount of turning across the blade row and no further increase in the loading of the blade was available.
