measurement of convective heat transfer by means of the reynolds analogy. preston's method for measuring skin friction in pipes has been extended to include non-uniform flow, with and without pressure gradients, over flat surfaces. by means of a modified form of the reynolds analogy, the local convective heat transfer coefficient can be related to the skin friction, and it is proposed that the method be used in aerodynamic models of furnaces and in heat transfer plant of simple geometry. more investigations are required of the effects of fluid turbulence, surface roughness and surface curvature on convective heat transfer and skin friction.
