magnetohydrodynamic free-convection pipe flow. it has been shown that transverse magnetic fields of practical strengths exert considerable influence on liquid-metal, free-convection, vertical, flat-plate and parallel-plate flow fields. the extent of influence was determined by the magnitude of a nondimensional parameter a which is the ratio of the hartmann number to the fourth root of the grashof number, and is a measure of the relative influence of the magnetic and buoyant forces. in this note the steady, fully developed, laminar, free-convection flow of a fluid of electrical conductivity through a fully submerged, open-ended, constant-temperature, vertical pipe located in a transverse magnetic field of strength is analyzed in terms of the same parameter. the magnitude of its influence on the velocity and temperature profiles, the surface shear and heat transfer, and the volumetric flow rate is determined.
