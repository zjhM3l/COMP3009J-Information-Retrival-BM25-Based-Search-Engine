on turbulen flow between parallel plates. the reynolds equations of motion of turbulent flow of incompressible fluid have been studied for turbulent flow between parallel plates. the number of these equations is finally reduced to two. one of these consists of mean velocity and correlation between transverse and longitudinal turbulent-velocity fluctuations only. the other consists of the mean pressure and transverse turbulent-velocity intensity. some conclusions about the mean pressure distribution and turbulent fluctuations are drawn. these equations are applied to two special cases.. one is poiseuille flow in which both plates are at rest and the other is couette flow in which one plate is at rest and the other is moving with constant velocity. the mean velocity distribution and the correlation can be expressed in a form of polynomial of the co-ordinate in the direction perpendicular to the plates, with the ratio of shearing stress on the plate to that of the corresponding laminar flow of the same maximum velocity as a parameter. these expressions hold true all the way across the plates, i.e., both the turbulent region and viscous layer including the laminar sublayer. these expressions for poiseuille flow have been checked with experimental data of laufer fairly well. it also shows that the logarithmic mean velocity distribution is not a rigorous solution of reynolds equations.
