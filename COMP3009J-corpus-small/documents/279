supersonic drag calculations for a cylindrical shell wing of semicircular cross section combined with a central body of revolution. a semi-circular ring wing with a body of revolution on the axis is studied to find the wave and the vortex drag for various chordwise lift distributions and for three values of a parameter describing the wing geometry. using the wave drag obtained from the chordwise loading that gives the least drag, together with the vortex and skin friction drags, the maximum lift to drag ratio for each wing geometry is computed. compared to the estimates made by lomax and heaslet, somewhat lower drags are found.
