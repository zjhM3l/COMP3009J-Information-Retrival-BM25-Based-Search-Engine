nonequilibrium flow past a wedge. an exact numerical solution is obtained for the chemically reacting flow past a wedge. the freestream is either in equilibrium or out of equilibrium but nonreacting. the attached shock wave is shown to be either concave, convex, or straight, depending on the values of the amount of dissociation in the freestream and a parameter describing the amount of energy contained in the freestream relative to the gas dissociation energy. numerical examples are presented illustrating these regimes. the flow field is characterized by the presence of an entropy layer and a relaxation layer, both easily identifiable in the presentation of the numerical results.
