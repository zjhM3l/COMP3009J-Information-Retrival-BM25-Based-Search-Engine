an investigation to determine conditions under which downwash from vtol aircraft will start surface erosion from various types of terrain. results of an investigation with small-scale equipment of the conditions under which the downwash from a hovering vertical-take-off- and-landing (vtol) aircraft will start surface erosion indicate that the onset of erosion depends only on the dynamic pressure of the outward flow of air near the surface. for a rotor or propeller at a height of about 1 slipstream diameter above the surface, this surface dynamic pressure was found to be equal to the disk loading. for the vtol aircraft supported by a ducted fan, the surface dynamic pressure with the ducted fan exit at a height of about one-half the exit-area loading. the surface dynamic pressure decreases rapidly with increasing height of the vtol device. erosion of sand and loose dirt started at surface dynamic pressures of 1 to 3 lb sq ft, which is in general agreement with helicopter experience. thoroughly soaking the sand and loose-dirt surfaces increased the resistance to erosion to surface dynamic pressures of 30 to 50 lb sq ft. spray from water started at surface dynamic pressures of 1.5 to pressures up to about 1,000 lb sq ft.
