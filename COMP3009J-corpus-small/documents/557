a numerical comparison between exact and approximate theories of hypersonic inviscid flow past slender blunt nosed bodies. this note refers to paper of same title by feldman in ars j. 30, validity of blast wave theory cannot be justified on rational or theoretical grounds because of different values of energy in cross flow field as calculated by this theory and by method of characteristics. present note questions this conclusion, shows reasonably good agreement when energy is calculated for points where shock location, streamline pattern, and velocity, temperature, and pressure profiles are adequately defined, and still better agreement when energy is calculated from flow quantities provided by- characteristics method. results are checked using data from independent source. conclusion is reached that blast wave theory is still valid.
