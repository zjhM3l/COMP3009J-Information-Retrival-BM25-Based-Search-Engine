on the theory of thin elastic toroidal shells. the author obtains asymptotic solutions to the problem of rotationally symmetric small deflection of thin toroidal elastic shells. he first reduces the problem to that of integrating a single linear nonhomogeneous ordinary differential equation involving two parameters. asymptotic formulae for the complementary function are obtained by applying the general method of langer (trans.amer.math.soc.33, advantage of yielding results valid near the points where the tangent plane is perpendicular to the axis of revolution, where the methods of asymptotic integration customary in shell theory fail (see the preceding review). for two problems in which only the complementary function is required, the author's results are compared with those obtained by wissler (dissertation, zurich, 1916) by a method of power series expansion,. the agreement is within 4 or better. the author observes that the usual method of obtaining asymptotic expressions for a particular integral, being based on using as an approximation the complementary function obtained from the membrane theory, will fail near points where the tangent plane is perpendicular to the axis of revolution. he therefore introduces a new method, which he states was developed jointly with e. reissner. he applies his results to the cases of an joint loaded symmetrically and parallel to its axis, a corrugated pipe subject to axial load, and a corrugated cylinder subject to axial pressure. many numerical calculations are involved and there are two tables of functions occuring in the solutions.
