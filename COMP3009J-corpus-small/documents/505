transition measurements on cones in free flight ballistics range tests. navy-sponsored experimental investigation of the location of boundary-layer transition on sharp-nosed cones having 10 total angles. the ambient temperature in a portion of the aeroballistics range is varied so as to obtain different adiabatic recovery temperatures at a constant nominal mach number of 3.1. the location of transition is expressed as a transition reynolds number, and results are presented graphically as a function of the ratio between the wall temperature and the adiabatic recovery temperature.
