the relation between wall temperature and the effect of roughness on boundary layer transition. the experimentally demonstrated rise and subsequent fall of transition reynolds number with decreasing wall- to-ambient temperature ratio has been the subject of two recent notes. in both cases it was argued that the increased effectiveness of roughness due to wall cooling was not sufficient to explain the transition-reversal phenomenon on nominally smooth bodies. in one case, the criterion for transition reversal was taken to be and in the other values of as low as eter is a reynolds number formed from velocity and kinematic viscosity based on calculated conditions at the height of roughness element k in the undisturbed, laminar boundary layer at the station of roughness location. the present note is submitted to show that another method for evaluating the effect of roughness on transition leads to an opposite conclusion.
