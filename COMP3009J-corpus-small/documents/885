buckling of thin cylindrical shells under hoop stresses varying in axial direction. the buckling of a thin cylindrical shell simply supported along the perimeter of its end sections is analyzed under hoop compressive stresses varying in the axial direction. the thermal stresses arising from a uniform increase in the temperature of the cylinder are determined. it is found that such thermal stresses are not likely to cause elastic buckling. simple approximate formulas are developed for buckling stress and thermal stress.
