orbit decay and prediction of the motion of artificial satellites. the rate of decay of elliptic satellite orbits, due to atmospheric drag, is investigated through variation of parameters and through use of an atmospheric model involving a power function between density and altitude. this model is shown to fit actual conditions better than an exponential function. the effects of the equatorial belt and the rotation of the earth are investigated. the conclusion is reached that through these anomalies atmospheric drag substantially affects the orbit elements, especially those defining the orbit plane. an alternate approach of variation of parameters is presented, by which a direct relation between period decay and instantaneous density conditions is established. this approach, by itself specifically adequate for prediction work, also opens an avenue for systematic and unified evaluation of observed decay.
