slender delta wings with sharp edges at zero lift. several slender wings of delta planform with sharp edges have been investigated theoretically at zero lift at subsonic and at supersonic speeds. most of the wings have diamond-shaped cross sections and are intended to lead to a type of flow with leading-edge separation in the lifting condition. the pressure distributions and overall normal-pressure drags resulting from various theoretical methods are compared with one another and some discussion is included concerning the possibility of achieving the results, calculated for an inviscid stream, in a real flow in the presence of a viscous layer around the body.
