means and examples of aeronautical research in france at onera. cosmonautics is currently very much to the forefront in the news. it embraces and extends aeronautics, and i would like to propose including both, at least on certain occasions, under a general denomination of /aerocosmonautics/. in your country, the sciences and technology of space are subjects which have been backed by initial advances and abundantly treated. since france has not yet launched any artificial satellite or built any circumlunar space vehicle, i propose to confine myself here to the field of aeronautics, where there is still so much progress of manifest utility to accomplish. i shall accordingly content myself with presenting some examples of aeronautical research and experiments undertaken in my country by onera, a body whose mission is akin to that of the illustrious naca, now nasa, but bearing in mind the considerable difference between the scales of the respective resources.
