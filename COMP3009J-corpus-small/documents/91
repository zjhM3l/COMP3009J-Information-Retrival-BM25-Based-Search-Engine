periodic temperature distribution in a two-layer composite slab. in a recent contribution to the reader's forum, under the above title, stonecypher outlined a method for finding the periodic temperature distribution in a two-layer composite slab, one exposed surface of the slab being insulated and the other subject to a sinusoidal temperature variation. perfect thermal contact between the two layers, and constant thermal properties were assumed. two years ago i drew attention in these pages to a method for determining the transient temperature in such a two-layer slab resulting from a triangular heat-input pulse. i should like to point out that this same method also is applicable to the case where one external face is given a sinusoidal temperature variation with time. the method is based on the analogy between one-dimensional heat flow and the flow of an electric current in a simple transmission line having only series resistance and parallel capacitance.
