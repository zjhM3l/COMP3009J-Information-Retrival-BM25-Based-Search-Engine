modulated entry. the technique of modulation, or variable coefficients, is discussed and the analytical formulation is reviewed. representative numerical results of the use of modulation are shown for the lifting and nonlifting cases. these results include the effects of modulation on peak acceleration, entry corridor, and heat absorption. results are given for entry at satellite speed and escape speed. the indications are that coefficient modulation on a vehicle with good lifting capability offers the possibility of sizable loading reductions or, alternatively, wider corridors,. thus, steep entries become practical from the loading standpoint. the amount of steepness depends on the acceptable heating penalty. the price of sizable fractions of the possible gains does not appear to be excessive.
