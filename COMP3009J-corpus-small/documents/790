a wind-tunnel test technique for measuring the dynamic rotary stability derivatives at subsonic and supersonic speeds. a method is described for measuring the dynamic stability derivatives of a model airplane in a wind tunnel. the characteristic features of this system are that single-degree-of-freedom oscillations were used to obtain combinations of rolling, yawing and pitching motions., that the oscillations were excited and controlled by velocity feedback which permitted operation under conditions unfavorable for more conventional types of oscillatory testing., and that data processing was greatly simplified by using analog computer elements in the strain-gage circuitry. the system described is primarily for measurement of the damping derivatives damping in roll damping in pitch, damping in yaw, and the cross derivatives rolling moment due to yawing and yawing moment due to rolling. the method of testing also permits measurement under oscillatory conditions of the static derivatives rolling moment due to sideslip, yawing moment due to sideslip, and pitching moment due to angle of attack. all these derivatives are of particular importance in estimating the short-period oscillatory motions of a rigid airplane. a small number of experimental data are included to illustrate the general scope of results obtainable with this system.
