experimental study of the equivalence of transonic flow about slender cone-cylinders of circular and elliptic cross section. this report describes an experimental investigation of the equivalence relationship and the related theory for lifting forces proposed by transonic slender-body theory. the models chosen for this study are a flat, winglike, elliptic cone-cylinder and its equivalent body of revolution, a circular cone-cylinder. it is determined that the flows about the two models are closely related in the manner predicted by the theory, the relationship persisting over a mach number range of 0.92 to cone-cylinder vary linearly only over the small angle-of-attack range of approximately 1 and that the aerodynamic loading at sonic speed compares favorably with jones' slender-wing theory. the results of the investigation suggest that at transonic speeds and at small angles of attack the calculation of all aerodynamic characteristics of slender, three-dimensional shapes can be made by use of transonic slender-body theory when the pressures on the equivalent body of revolution are known, either by experiment, or by an adequate nonlinear theory. from transonic slender-body theory it is deduced that the slenderness required for this application is the same as that required for the successful application of the transonic area rule.
