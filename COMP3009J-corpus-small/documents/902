some current and proposed investigations into the flow for slender delta and other wings in unsteady motion. the practical need for research into the aerodynamics of slender delta wings in unsteady motion has been emphasized in a recent paper by zbrozek. two important aspects are.. - formation and presence of leading-edge vortices. with oscillatory or transient modes of longitudinal (or chordwise) bending. the first of the aspects above, has already been briefly discussed in ref. 2. one feature of the flow with leading-edge vortices which seems to be of particular significance to the dynamic behaviour of a wing is the shedding of vorticity at the leading edge as well as at the trailing edge. any time-dependent motion, or distortion, of the wing leads to a change in the rate at which vorticity is shed. with more conventional types of flow, the free vorticity being shed only from the trailing edge has diminishing influence on the wing, but when the free vorticity is shed from the leading edge, in passing downstream, it remains close to the upper surface of the wing. it might be expected then, that, although the magnitudes of the unsteady forces may not be greatly affected for a slender delta, the time delays associated with the forces may be significantly different for the attached and separated regimes of leading-edge flow.
