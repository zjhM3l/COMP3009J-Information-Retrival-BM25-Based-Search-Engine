transient magnetohydrodynamic duct flow. parallel flow of an electrically conducting viscous incompressible fluid in a rectangular duct with transverse magnetic field is considered. the walls of the duct which are parallel and perpendicular to the imposed magnetic field are taken to be nonconducting and perfectly conducting, respectively. assuming the fluid to be at rest at the initial moment, exact solutions for the velocity and magnetic field components are obtained in the form of convolution integrals taking the longitudinal pressure gradient as an arbitrary given function of time. later, taking a step function for the pressure gradient, these expressions are integrated. for this case, the effect of the strength of the imposed magnetic field on the development behavior of the flow is studied. it is found that except for very large magnetic fields, the flows are over damped.
