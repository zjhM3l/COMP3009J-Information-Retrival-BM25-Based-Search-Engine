investigation of effectiveness of large-chord slotted flaps in deflecting propeller slipstreams downward for vertical take-off and low-speed flight. an investigation of the effectiveness of a wing equipped with large-chord slotted flaps in rotating the thrust vector of propellers through the angles required for vertical take-off and for flight at very low speeds has been conducted in the facilities of the langley 300 mph 7- by 10-foot tunnel. under conditions of static thrust and with zero incidence between the thrust axis and the wing chord plane, the slotted flaps were effective in rotating the thrust vector upward about than 10 percent of the thrust. when an auxiliary vane was added above the wing, the thrust vector was rotated upward configuration, vertical take-off could be achieved with an initial attitude of 16 and at airplane weights up to 90 percent of the total propeller thrust. the addition of 10 incidence between the thrust axis and the wing increased the upward rotation of the thrust vector about 10. for the same turning angle, the diving moments associated with the slotted-flap configurations were approximately twice as large as the diving moments of the configurations with plain flaps and two auxiliary vanes.
