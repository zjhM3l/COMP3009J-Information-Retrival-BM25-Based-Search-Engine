on the concept of stability of inelastic systems. simple models are employed to bring out the large and important differences between buckling in the plastic range and classical elastic instability. static and kinetic criteria are compared and their interrelation discussed. nonlinear behavior in particular is often found to be the key to the physically valid solution. the nonconservative nature of plastic deformation in itself or in combination with the nonlinearity requires concepts not found in classical approaches. conversely, the classical linearized condition of neutral equilibrium is really not relevant in inelastic buckling. plastic buckling loads are not uniquely defined but cover a range of values and are often more properly thought of as maximum loads for some reasonable initial imperfection in geometry or dynamic disturbance. the models indicate that basically the same information is obtained from essentially static systems by assuming initial imperfection in geometric forms as by assuming dynamic disturbances. one approach complements the other and both are helpful in obtaining an understanding of the physical phenomena.
