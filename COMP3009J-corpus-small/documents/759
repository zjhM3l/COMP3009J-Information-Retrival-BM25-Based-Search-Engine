stability investigation of a blunted cone and a blunted ogive with a flared cylinder afterbody at mach numbers from 0. 30 to 2. 85. a cone with a blunt nose tip and a blunt nose tip and a 20 flared cylinder afterbody have been tested in free flight over a mach number range from 0.30 to 2.85 and a reynolds number range from 1 x 10 to 23 x 10. time histories, cross plots of force and moment coefficients, and plots of the longitudinal-force coefficient, rolling velocity, aerodynamic center, normal-force-curve slope, and dynamic stability are presented. with the center-of-gravity location at about models were both statically and dynamically stable throughout the mach number range. for the cone, the average aerodynamic center moved slightly forward with decreasing speeds and the normal-force-curve slope was fairly constant throughout the speed range. for the ogive, the average aerodynamic center remained practically constant and the normal-force-curve slope remained practically constant to a mach number of approximately 1.6 where a rising trend was noted. maximum drag coefficient for the cone, with reference to the base area, was approximately 0.6, and for the ogive, with reference to the area of the cylindrical portion, was approximately 2.1.
