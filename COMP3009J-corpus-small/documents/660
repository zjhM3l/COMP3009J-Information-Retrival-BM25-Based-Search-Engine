the fundamental solution for small steady three dimensional disturbances to a two dimensional parallel shear flow. after a brief review of methods of calculating the flow fields produced by disturbances in rotational basic flows, the author points out a fundamental difficulty in the treated as a perturbation of the disturbance field that would occur if the basic flow were uniform).. slow attenuation of the secondary-flow disturbance with distance from the obstacle. the author conjectured (same j. 1 the trouble was caused by nonuniform validity of the approximation sequence in the region far from the obstacle. the analogy with /stokes' and whitehead's paradoxes/ is mentioned, and a solution analogous to oseen's is suggested, one in which disturbances, but not the shear, are assumed to be small. in this paper, such a solution is found, and is shown to overlap with the small-shear, secondary-flow solution. the basic flow is a parallel, steady, inviscid, two-dimensional shear flow. the / fundamental solution/ due to a weak source is sought. the method of fourier transforms is used. simple solutions are found for a uniformly sheared basic flow (where the result coincides with the secondary-flow solution) and for an exponential basic-flow profile. in the general case it is assumed that the parallel basic flow becomes uniform at, where the x-axis lies in the flow direction. the character of the solution is determined by studying its hankel transform, especially for the class of flows where the total variation of the basic stream speed v(y) is small. an interpretation in terms of images, due to m. b. glauert, is given, and finally the relationship of the present work to theories of the displacement of the stagnation streamline (displacement effect of pitot tubes) is discussed.
