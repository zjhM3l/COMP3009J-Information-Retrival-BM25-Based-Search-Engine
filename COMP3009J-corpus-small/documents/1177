effects of rapid heating on strength of airframe components. results of several experimental investigations are presented which indicate the effects of rapid heating on the bending strength of multiweb beams and ring-stiffened cylinders. it is shown that thermal stresses reduce the bending load carried at buckling by both beams and cylinders. the influence of thermal stress on maximum load is found to depend largely on the mode of buckling. for beams that buckle locally, no apparent effect of thermal stress on the maximum load has been found. a reduction in maximum load has been observed for beams that buckle in the wrinkling mode and for cylinders.
