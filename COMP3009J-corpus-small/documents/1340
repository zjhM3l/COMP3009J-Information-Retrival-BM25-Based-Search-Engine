method of controlling stiffness properties of a solid-construction model wing. a simple method is presented for controlling the bending and torsional stiffnesses of a solid-construction model wing. the method consists of weakening the wing by drilling holes through the wing normal to the chord plane. aerodynamic continuity is maintained by filling the holes with a relatively soft material. the important parameters controlling the stiffnesses are the amount of material removed by drilling, the ratio of hole diameter to wing thickness, and the plan-form pattern of the holes. data are given which may be used for predicting the stiffness of a model wing weakened in this manner.
