a one-foot hypervelocity shock tunnel in which high-enthalpy real gas flows can be generated with flow times of about 180 milliseconds. a shock tunnel is described in which high-enthalpy, real-gas air flows can be generated with flow times of about 180 milliseconds. this shock tunnel is operated with a combustion-heated driver gas and consists of a combustion chamber, shock tube, supersonic nozzle, test section, and vacuum tank. an essential feature of this shock tunnel is a means for achieving a constant-pressure air reservoir for the duration of the test. air streams with velocities in excess of achieved at a mach number of about 10. the corresponding stream total enthalpy is about 4,500 btu lb and the stagnation pressure is 3.25 psia.
