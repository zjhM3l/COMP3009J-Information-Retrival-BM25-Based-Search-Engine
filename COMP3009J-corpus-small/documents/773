q. app. math. 7, 1950, 381. experiments on porous-wall cooling and flow separation control in a supersonic nozzle. control of flow separation by fluid injection at one diverging boundary of a two-dimensional, transparent-walled de laval nozzle was investigated by spark schlieren photography of dry nitrogen flows expanded from two stagnation temperatures injection conditions at the permeable boundary were varied by the use of three grades of porous stainless steel with nominal pore diameters of 10, 20, and 30 microns, through which nitrogen was forced by coolant reservoir pressures of 25, 50, and 100 psig, in addition to the case of no forced injection. pressure distribution measurements were made along the nonpermeable diverging boundary. it was found that flow separation at expansion ratios approaching the optimum value for maximum thrust coefficient could be induced at the porous wall by a local injection mass velocity of the order of a few per cent of the local main-stream mass velocity. separation at the solid boundary was not noticeably influenced by injection at the opposite wall, and the asymmetrical separation thus effected jet deflections of up to 10 degrees at the lower stagnation-pressure levels. variation of the wall heat-transfer condition by changing the stagnation temperature did not significantly influence separation behavior. temperature measurements at the reservoir face of the porous section, together with use of published correlations and of the rube-sin analysis for estimation of stream-side stanton numbers under noninjection and injection conditions, respectively, permitted heat-transfer calculations which indicated that the effectiveness of the transpiration technique in controlling nozzle wall temperatures derives primarily from intimate fluid-solid contact in a porous material of high specific surface.
