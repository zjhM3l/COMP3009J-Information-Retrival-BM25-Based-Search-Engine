the analysis of redundant structures by the use of high-speed digital computers. large-scale redundant structure analyses are currently feasible by the use of modern high-speed digital computers. this capability opportunely meets the urgent need to solve complex problems which otherwise would be hopelessly beyond the capacity of the hand desk computer. however, the difficulties have now shifted from tedious hand computations to the problems of adequately representing the structure by a model and of the peculiarities of irregular geometrical configurations. a wide scope of problem types can be handled by a generalized program approach. matrix formulation is used for the organization of input data and for handling data transfer in the large complex of subroutines, including the formation of equilibrium and continuity conditions to the final loads and deflections. simultaneous treatment of thermal expansions and plasticity is included. the use of minimum-size redundant systems is emphasized, starting from the philosophy of cutting members to provide a statically determinate structure. improved numerical accuracy and problem size capacity is gained for a given computer. examples are discussed ranging from simple plane-load diffusion problems to pressurized fuselage cutouts and complex wing-fuselage-shell intersection-type problems.
