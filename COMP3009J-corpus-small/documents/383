integration of the boundary layer equations for a plane in compressible flow with heat transfer. the equations of motion of compressible viscous flow with vanishing pressure gradient past a plane are integrated in semi-convergent expressions, for the case when the physical constants depend on temperature and the prandtl number is close to unity. simple expressions are obtained for the temperature and velocity distributions in the boundary layer, the drag coefficient, and their dependence on the physical constants,.they contain the well-known results and several new ones. for the case when the temperature of the boundary is either above, or not much below, the temperature of the main flow, the results obtained closely agree with crocco's numerical computations.
