similitude of hypersonic flows over slender bodies in non-equilibrium dissociated gases. this paper is concerned with the similitude laws governing inviscid, nonequilibrium gas flows around blunt or sharp-nosed slender bodies at zero angle of attack, based on the hypersonic small disturbance flow theory. some related features of the interaction between the effects of nose bluntness and nonequilibrium dissociation and vibration and the influence of a dissociated freestream are also discussed. the hypersonic equivalence principle and the related similitude for affinely related bodies are set forth for nonequilibrium flows in either diatomic gases or a gas mixture such as air. for a family of diatomic gases, as opposed to a given gas such as air, a generalized ambient gas state scaling condition is obtained, whereby the ambient density and temperature need not be simulated. a detailed discussion is given of blunted cylinders and slabs or sharp-nosed cones and wedges, including example nonequilibrium flow field correlations of numerical solutions available in the literature. low density nonequilibrium flows with a negligible shock layer atom recombination rate are also examined ,. as expected, a less restrictive small disturbance similitude law is obtained in this case.
