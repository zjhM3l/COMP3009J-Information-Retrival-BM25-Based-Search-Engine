nonlinear heat transfer problem. a study has been made of the time-dependent heat conduction in a semi-infinite medium subject to a boundary condition which can involve the temperature in a nonlinear manner. a formulation for the determination of the surface temperature, which is often of greatest physical interest, leads to a nonlinear volterra integral equation. a simple iterative solution method, with an accuracy suitable for many practical purposes is presented. as an example, the problem of the time-dependent surface temperature of a body receiving heat according to the stefan-boltzmann law is treated. the analysis is also applicable to physical adsorption or chemisorption processes which occur at the boundary.
