combustion in the boundary layer on a porous surface. the position of the diffusion flame in a boundary layer with uniform mixture injection from a porous wall parallel to a uniform air stream is determined under the conditions of laminar, steady flow with zero streamwise pressure gradient. under the assumption of fast forward reaction rate, solutions of the boundary layer forms of the conservation laws of acrothermochemistry are obtained leading to a formula for the downstream velocity at the flame in terms of composition and flow variables. the rates of change of conditions at the wall in the streamwise direction are assumed to be relatively small. methods of treating complex reaction systems are described, and generalized form of the reynolds analogy is developed.
