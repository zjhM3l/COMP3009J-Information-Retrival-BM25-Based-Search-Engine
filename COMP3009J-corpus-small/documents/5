one-dimensional transient heat conduction into a double-layer slab subjected to a linear heat input for a small time internal. analytic solutions are presented for the transient heat conduction in composite slabs exposed at one surface to a triangular heat rate. this type of heating rate may occur, for example, during aerodynamic heating.
