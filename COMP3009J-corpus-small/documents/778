an integral related to the radiation integrals. the author points out the relation of the integral to problems in astrophysics and quantum mechanics, and because of its importance supplies a table of values. the table gives rl(x) to seven places of decimals from x=0 to x=6.00 at intervals of 0.01. second order central differences are tabulated to assist in interpolation.
