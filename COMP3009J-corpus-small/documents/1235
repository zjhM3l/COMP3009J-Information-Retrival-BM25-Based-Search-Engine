a theory of the two dimensional laminar bounary layer over a curved surface. the purpose of this paper is to present a theory to account for surface curvature effects on the two-dimensional boundary-layer flow which approaches a potential flow at free stream. the problem of two-dimensional viscous flow is first formulated by using the streamlines and their orthogonal trajectories as the generalized coordinates. a boundary-layer approximation is applied to the navier-stokes equations and the gauss equation in the generalized coordinates to yield the boundary-layer equations. the conditions under which similar solutions of the boundary-layer equations exist are determined. by a simple transformation, the governing differential equation can be expressed in a form which reduces to the falkner-skan equation for zero surface curvature. numerical results for a similar solution which corresponds to a flow over a curved surface with zero surface pressure gradient have been obtained. the velocity profiles in the boundary layer and the wall skin-friction distribution for concave and convex surfaces are presented. the wall skin friction for a convex wall is found to be higher than the blasius value for a flat plate. on the other hand, for a concave wall, the skin friction will drop below the blasius value as the curvature increases, but it appears to reach a minimum, and beyond this minimum point it will increase again. the same flow problem was treated by murphy by a different method of analysis. comparison of murphy's results with those obtained by the present method reveals some basic differences in the boundary-layer characteristics. in particular, murphy's results indicate that the wall skin friction for a convex surface is smaller than the blasius value, while for a concave wall it is higher.
