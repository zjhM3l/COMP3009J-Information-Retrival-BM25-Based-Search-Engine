a small deflection theory for curved sandwich plates. a small-deflection theory that takes into account deformations due to transverse shear is presented for the elastic-behavior analysis of orthotropic plates of constant cylindrical curvature with considerations of buckling included. the theory is applicable primarily to sandwich construction.
