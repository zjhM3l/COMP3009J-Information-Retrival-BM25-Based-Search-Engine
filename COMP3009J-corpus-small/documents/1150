preliminary results of density measurements from an air force satellite. atmospheric density was determined from a singly mounted ionization gauge flown on an air force satellite. included is a brief description of the experiment and theory as well as a discussion of some of the problems involved in performing these measurements. density data are given for the altitude range of 370 to 400 km during early morning hours for the two days 17 and 18 june 1961. results are compared with those of the 1961 revised u.s. standard atmosphere.
