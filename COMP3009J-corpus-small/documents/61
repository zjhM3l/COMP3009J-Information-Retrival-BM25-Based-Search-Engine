on flow of electrically conducting fluids over a flat plate in the presence of a transverse magnetic field. the use of a magnetic field to control the motion of electrically conducting fluids is studied. the boundary-layer solutions are found for flow over a flat plate when the magnetic field is fixed relative to the plate or to the fluid. the equations are integrated numerically for the effect of the transverse magnetic field on the velocity and temperature profiles, and hence, the skin friction and rate of heat transfer. it is concluded that the skin friction and the heat-transfer rate are reduced when the transverse magnetic field is fixed relative to the plate and increased when fixed relative to the fluid. the total drag is increased in all the cases studied.
