the design of intermediate vertical stiffeners on web plates subjected to shear. the correct design of intermediate vertical stiffeners on web plates subjected to shear becomes very important when the web plates are designed to operate at loads close to their buckling loads. this paper presents details of an extensive series of tests conducted on stiffened web plates subjected to shear. from the analysis of the results obtained from these tests, new empirical relationships between the flexural rigidity and spacing of the intermediate stiffeners and the buckling stress of the stiffened web plate have been obtained. one interesting and important feature of these new relationships is that they define more clearly than hitherto the difference in the behaviour of single-and double-sided stiffeners.
