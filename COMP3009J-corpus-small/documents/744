lower buckling load in the non-linear buckling theory of thin shells. for thin shells the relation between the load p and the deflection beyond the classical buckling load is very often non-linear. for instance, when a uniform thin circular cylinder is loaded in the axial direction, the load p when plotted against the end-shortening has the characteristic shown in fig. 1. if the strain energy s and the total potential are calculated, their behavior can be represented by the curves shown in figs. 2 and 3. it can be demonstrated that the branches oc and ab corresponds to stable equilibrium configurations and the branch bc to unstable equilibrium configurations. the point b is then the point of transition from stable to unstable equilibrium configurations.
