experimental investigation of the downstream influence of stagnation point mass transfer. this report presents the results of an experimental investigation of the downstream influence of localized mass transfer in the stagnation region of a blunt body under hypersonic flow conditions. the coolant is injected through a porous plug coaxial with the centerline of symmetry of the model. the tests were carried out in a wind tunnel with a mach number of 6.0, stagnation temperatures of approximately 1,600 r., and a stagnation pressure of approximately 600 psia. four different gases were injected over a range of mass flows. the heat transfer on the impermeable section was measured under isothermal wall conditions,. for the higher rates of mass flow, adiabatic surface temperatures were also determined. the theoretical analysis of the boundary-layer flow is investigated in order to establish the similarity parameters for the flow system. these parameters permit the extrapolation of the test results to other flow conditions, provided that laminar flow prevails. helium is found to be the most efficacious coolant.
