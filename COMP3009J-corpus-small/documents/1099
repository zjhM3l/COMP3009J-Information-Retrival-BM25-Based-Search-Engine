a theoretical study of stagnation point ablation. a simplified analysis is made of the shielding mechanism which reduces the stagnation-point heat transfer when ablation takes place at the surface. the most significant result of the analysis is that the effective heat capacity of the ablation material increases linearly with stream enthalpy. the automatic shielding mechanism is discussed and the significant thermal properties of a good ablation material are given parameters.
