experimental ablation cooling. this paper presents the results of an experimental investigation on the ablation of a number of promising materials for heating conditions comparable to those which may be encountered by unmanned reentry satellite vehicles, as well as for higher heating conditions comparable to those associated with reentry ballistic missiles. materials tested included the plastics teflon, nylon, and lucite,. the inorganic salts ammonium chloride and sodium carbonate,. graphite,. a phenolic resin and fiber glass composition,. and the commercial material haveg rocketon. results of these tests indicated heat-absorption capabilities which are several times greater than those of current metallic heat-sink materials. the results with teflon showed that for hemispherical noses there was no apparent effect of size or stagnation-point pressure on ablation rate for the range of variables covered in the tests. for flat-faced configurations, however, there was a definite increase in the ablation rate with increased stagnation-point pressure. the results for the several materials tested at heating rates associated with reentry ballistic missiles showed considerable increase in the effective heats of ablation over the results obtained at lower heating rates. this trend of increased effectiveness with increased heating potential is in agreement with the predictions of ablation theories. comparisons of the results for several materials tested at the higher heating rates showed graphite to have the lowest ablation rate of all materials tested.
