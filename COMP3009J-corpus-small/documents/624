cruise performance of channel-flow ground effect machines. the performance theory for high-speed air-cushion vehicles operating in close proximity to the ground is developed. the analysis is restricted to cruise flight of vehicles of rectangular planform employing an air pressure seal between the ground and the vehicle along the two streamwise sides. the variation of the optimum rearward deflection angle of the side jet pressure seal with speed for minimum overall power expenditure and maximum range is found. it is concluded that a mixed propulsion system (jet deflection plus propeller(s)) is required. volume flow and the corresponding fan pressure rise needed are also calculated. the maximum lift drag ratio is determined. the maximum thickness ratios of the vehicles are considered to be large compared with the ground-height vehicle-length ratio. two-dimensional airfoil theory is employed to show that close to stagnation conditions exist below the vehicles. the lower-surface lift, pitching moment, and aerodynamic-center location are determined. the flow over the upper surface is identified with flow over mounds. upper-surface lift coefficients are determined for typical mound shapes. it is shown that high total lift coefficients are theoretically obtainable with almost zero induced drag. the conventional induced-drag power penalty is replaced by a sealing-air power expenditure, which is shown not to be excessive.
