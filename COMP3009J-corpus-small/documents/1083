an investigation of fluid flow in two dimensions. flow of an inviscid fluid. -dash there are in existence several methods of obtaining numerical solutions to the two-dimensional flow of a perfect fluid for given boundary conditions. part 2 of the present paper gives a method of obtaining a numerical solution for viscous steady flow solution of the simpler problem, illustrating it with examples bearing on the experimental work described in part iv.
