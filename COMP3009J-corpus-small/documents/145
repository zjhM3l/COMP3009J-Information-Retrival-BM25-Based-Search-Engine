skin friction in the laminar boundary layer in compressible flow. from an analysis of the work of crocco and others, semi-empirical formulae are derived for the skin friction on a flat plate at zero incidence with a laminar boundary layer. these formulae are for the general case of heat transfer, and when there is no heat transfer. the problem of heat transfer and the effect of radiation are discussed in the light of these formulae. the second formula is then utilised in the development of an approximate method for solving the momentum equation of the boundary layer on a cylinder without heat transfer. the method indicates that with increase of mach number there is a marked forward movement of separation from a flat plate in the presence of a constant adverse velocity gradient.
