aerodynamic processes in the downwash-impingement problem. theoretical and experimental data relating to the downwash impingement problem are examined in order to arrive at a coherent understanding of the process of entrainment of ground particles in the flow. it is demonstrated that a key mechanism in the process is the interaction of nonuniform flow in the ground boundary layer with bluff ground particles. this interaction produces a lift force which, under typical conditions, equals or exceeds the particle weight. in the interest of quantitative prediction of the conditions necessary for particle entrainment, four subsidiary problem areas in the impinging jet are examined. these are the viscous decay, the inviscid flow field, the ground boundary layer, and the forces on a bluff body in nonuniform flow. applicable theories are used in conjunction with experimental data to assess the accuracy and range of validity of the theories, and to define the stream conditions which will cause particle entrainment. available data are applied to the establishment of criteria for particle entrainment in the vicinity of the impinging-jet stagnation point. these criteria show that entrainment occurs in a finite annular region on the ground plane, and that the particles most readily entrained are those with a diameter equal to about two-thirds the thickness of the ground boundary layer. the configuration size is shown to influence the process in that the onset of entrainment is fixed by the jet diameter and velocity, and the size of the ground particles. the criteria established provide a quantitative estimate of the conditions causing entrainment and provide a basis for scaling experimental results to a variety of full-scale situations.
