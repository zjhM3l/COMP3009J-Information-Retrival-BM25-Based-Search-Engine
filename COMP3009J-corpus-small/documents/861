charts adapted from van driest's turbulent flat-plate theory for determining values of turbulent aerodynamic friction and heat transfer coefficients. a modified method of van driest's flat-plate theory for turbulent boundary layer has been found to simplify the calculation of local skin-friction coefficients which, in turn, have made it possible to obtain through reynolds analogy theoretical turbulent heat-transfer coefficients in the form of stanton number. a general formula is given and charts are presented from which the modified method can be solved for mach numbers 1.0 to 12.0, temperature ratios 0.2 to 6.0, and reynolds numbers 0.2 x 10 to 200 x 10.
