inviscid-incompressible-flow theory of static two-dimensional solid jets, in proximity to the ground. the inviscid-incompressible-flow theory of static two- dimensional solid jets impinging orthogonally on the ground is presented using conformal mapping methods. it is shown that the thrust of a solid jet at constant power initially decreases as the ground is approached. the magnitude of the thrust out of ground effect is regained only at a very low height-to-jet width ratio (approximately 0.55). the maximuin decrease is about 6 percent. the ground effect on solid jets is thus largely unfavorable.
