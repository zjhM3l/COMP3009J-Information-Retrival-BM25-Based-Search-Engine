the stability of thin-walled unstiffened circular cylinders under axial compression including the effects of internal pressure. in the design of high-speed aircraft the importance of unpressurized and pressurized monocoque cylinders necessitates a reliable analysis procedure for the compressive buckling of cylindrical shells. analysis by the classical small-deflection theory has proved inadequate. recent large-deflection theoretical treatments of the problem have shown reasonable correlation with experiments but require a prior knowledge of the initial imperfections of the cylinder. developed in this paper is a semiempirical procedure which permits a compressive buckling analysis of cylindrical shells with a knowledge of the cylinder geometry only. this analysis is achieved by correlating experimental data statistically with theoretical parameters. in order to provide data not previously available, an extensive series of axial compression tests of pressurized cylinders has been performed. these data, together with all other known test data, are analyzed semiempirically. in the analysis best-fit curves are presented using theoretical parameters and shapes of curves where applicable. unpressurized and pressurized cylinder compressive buckling curves are then developed as 90 per cent probability curves from the test data. in general, these statistically defined design curves are significantly lower than previously available design curves.
