the design of structures to resist jet noise fatigue. the design of structures to resist jet noise fatigue demands a knowledge of a wide range of subjects from pure acoustics at one hand to metal physics at the other. at the present time the various aspects of the problem are not sufficiently well know quantitatively for a purely theoretical design study to be made. never- the-less a knowledge of the behaviour of typical forms of construction in noise environments can be used with a limited amount of theoretical work to indicate tne most efficient types of structure. this approach to the problem is adopted in this lecture as it seems to be the most promising one available at the moment. it must be emphasized, however, that although some progress has been made in dicsovering the behaviour of a structure subjected to noise it is not possible to estimate the life of any component at the drawing board stage. some prototype strain measurements and proof testing are therefore essential if one is to prove the integrity of the design. within the structural limits of single skin construction set in this lecture the main conclusion to be reached is that no reasonable estimate of fatigue life can yet be made in the drawing board stage of a structure. nevertheless, a study of the form of behaviour of typical structures has led to a theoretical simplification of the problem of skin vibration. from this it has been possible to suggest an optimum deisgn for a skin stiffened by stringers. a suggestion for an optimum design of skin and rib for control surfaces to minimise stresses at the rib-skin intersection is put forward but no experience can check this yet. the most resonable basis for the future estimation of fatigue life of a component appears to be the /random/ s-n curve and consierable effort should be made to obtain the necessary test data. the life expectation of a new design will be uncertain and some proof testing is essential if the integrity of structure in high noise levels (150 db) is to be guaranteed.
