an experimental investigation of ablating material at low and high enthalpy potentials. the ablation performance characteristics of a number of materials were derived from tests conducted in a mach number 2.0 ethylene-heated high-temperature air jet having a maximum stagnation enthalpy potential of approximately 1,200 btu lb. the tests were conducted with 6- inch-diameter blunt nose shapes. the surface of most of the materials after testing was generally smooth and the unablated portions of the specimens were in appearance the same as before testing. in all cases, the back or inside surface of the specimens exhibited no evidence of heating. an evaluation of the enthalpy potential effect was obtained by comparison of the present data with previous tests conducted, on the in a subsonic arc-heated air jet. the stagnation enthalpy potential of this facility was approximately 7,000 btu lb. for teflon, the effective heat of ablation increased from approximately 1,250 btu lb to enthalpy potential was increased from
