the effect of helium injection at an axially symmetric stagnation point. an effective means of protecting the surface of a hypersonic re-entry vehicle is to inject small quantities of a lightweight gas into the boundary layer through a porous wall. this process, which is known as mass-transfer cooling, protects the surface in two ways. first of all, as the injected gas or coolant passes from the reservoir through the wall to the surface, a considerable quantity of heat is absorbed as its temperature is raised from the reservoir temperature to the wall surface temperature. characteristically, lightweight gases have relatively high specific heats. secondly, the transfer of mass and enthalpy by convection and diffusion normal to the surface alters the characteristics of the boundary layer in such a manner as to reduce the temperature gradient at the wall, and, hence, the conductive heat transfer at the wall. this is sometimes referred to as the blowing effect.
