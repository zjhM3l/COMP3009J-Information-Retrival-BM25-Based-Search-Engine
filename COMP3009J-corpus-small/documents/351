thermal distributions in jeffrey-hamel flows between nonparallel plane walls. the authors give the exact solution for the thermal distributions for the steady laminar flow of a viscous incompressible fluid between non-parallel plane walls held at a constant temperature. the velocity profiles are determined with the aid of jacobian elliptic functions by using the jeffery-hamel solution of the hydrodynamic problem. it is shown that in this special case the energy equation giving the temperature profiles can be reduced to an ordinary linear differential equation with variable coefficients. after the introduction of dimensionless parameters, numerical solutions are given for diverging and converging channels with total openings of 10degree for the possible combinations of three reynolds numbers and five prandtl numbers.
