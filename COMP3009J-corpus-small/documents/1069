design and testing of honeycomb sandwich cylinders under axial compression. experimental results for 36 diameter honeycomb cylinders fabricated with thin (0.010) aluminum faces and cores prove that it is quite feasible to stabilize thin faces so they can be loaded beyond the yield point. the effect of initial imperfections and the various modes of failure are discussed.
