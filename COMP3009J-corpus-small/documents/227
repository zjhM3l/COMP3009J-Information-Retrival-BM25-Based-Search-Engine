a technique for improving the predictions of linearised theory on the drag of straight edge wings. the curve of drag against mach number for straight-edged wings, calculated by using the linearised theory of supersonic flow, displays discontinuities in slope at the various mach numbers for which the edges are sonic. these features, which are not observed in practice, are due to the fact that linearised theory predicts an infinite pressure along a subsonic or sonic edge. it is shown that if the linearised equation of supersonic flow is used to determine the flow over straight-edged wings, but the linearised boundary condition is replaced by the full placed by plausible values. on this basis a simple method is derived for improving the linearised predictions of the drag of straight-edged wings which exhibits satisfactory agreement with experimental results. while the technique is not directly applicable to ridge lines, an artifice renders them amenable to similar treatment.
