some experimental investigations on the influence of wall boundary layers upon wind tunnel measurements at high subsonic speeds. pressure distribution measurements and drag determination by means of balance measurements have been carried out for a number of models at high subsonic velocity in wind tunnels, where the boundary layer of the walls has been varied. within the investigated range it appeared that a thickening of the boundary layer reduced the disturbing influence of the walls, which also caused an increase of the choking mach number. the phenomenon described should be of a certain importance from the point of view of wind tunnel technique, since it is possible to increase the choking velocity for a given model by means of thickening the boundary layer.
