newtonian flow theory for slender bodies. as an aid to the aerodynamieist in the design of air frames for hypersonic speeds (speeds faster than about mach 5), newtonian flow theory is examined from the point of view of gas dynamics and hypersonic small-disturbance theory. the usual theory is shown to result as the first approximation of an expansion valid for small. a basic similarity parameter is introduced. a general solution of the first approximation for the flow past slender bodies (bodies which cause only a small disturbance to the stream) at zero angle of attack is given. an important condition which limits the application of the theory is noted-namely, that the pressure coefficient on the surface not fall to zero. the theory is then applied to cones and to bodies whose shape is.
