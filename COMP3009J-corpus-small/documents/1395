low density stagnation point heat transfer measurements in the hypersonic shock tunnel. presents absolute heat-transfer measurements, using resistance thermometer, for hemisphere-cylinder at mach numbers 9.2 to 11.2. results show vorticity-interaction and viscous-layer effects increase heat transfer above values predicted by boundary-layer theory. data are correlated using cheng's reynolds-number- dependent parameter. investigation covers vorticity-interaction to incipient-merged-layer regimes (free-stream unit reynolds numbers
