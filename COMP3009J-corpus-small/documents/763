effects of internal pressure on the buckling of circular-cylindrical shells under bending. the effect of internal pressure on the small-deflection buckling of thin-walled cylinders under bending is investigated by means of a modified donnell equation. the results indicate that the maximum critical stress due to bending increases with internal pressure, unlike the case of pressurized cylinders under compression. these results represent the moment at which significant deformations appear in the cylinder, rather than the maximum moment able to be carried, but may be a good approximation to the latter for metal cylinders.
