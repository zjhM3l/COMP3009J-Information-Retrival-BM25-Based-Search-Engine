breathing vibrations of a circular shell with an internal liquid. resonant breathing frequencies and mode shapes are determined experimentally for a thin-walled, circular cylindrical shell containing a nonviscous incompressible liquid. the resonant frequencies determined for the full shell are in good agreement with those predicted by reissner's shallow-shell vibration theory with the inclusion of an apparent-mass term for the liquid. the effect of the internal liquid on the shell mode shapes is significant only for the partially full shell. in this case the circumferential node lines tend to shift toward the bottom or filled portion of the shell. excitation of low-frequency liquid-sloshing motion by high-frequency forced oscillation of a partially filled shell occurred in many cases. this low-frequency liquid response is tentatively explained as being excited by a beat frequency in the forced oscillation. a similar type of response has been reported by yarymovych in axially excited rigid tanks.
