stresses in continuous skin stiffener panels under random loading. theoretical aspects involved in the prediction of stress levels for continuous skin-stiffener panels subjected to a random pressure field are considered in the light of powell's general theory for statistical superposition of modal response. the choice of structural model is dictated by the prevalence of skin-stiffener construction in modern flight vehicle design. the present study clearly demonstrates that any truly adequate prediction of stress levels in actual aircraft structures requires a much better representation of structural characteristics than can be provided by single panel idealizations. in an example considering fuselage panels exposed to jet engine noise, essential agreement is shown with experimental data, although better correlation is shown for rms stress than for power spectrum. it is shown that reduction of stress level by increasing damping is effective only in the higher frequency range.
