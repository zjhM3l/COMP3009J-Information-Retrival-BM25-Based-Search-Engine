exact solution of the neumann problem. calculation for non- circulatory plane and axially symmetric flows about or within arbitrary boundaries. an exact general method of solving the neumann or second boundary-value problem has been developed and has been applied to the calculation of low-speed flows about or within bodies of almost any shape, provided the flow is either plane or has axial symmetry. solid-body, inlet, and purely internal flow problems can be solved. the method is capable of dealing with several bodies at once in the presence of one another, and consequently interference problems can be treated with ease. boundaries need not be solid, that is, flows involving area suction can be calculated. velocities can be computed not only for points on the surface of the body but for the entire flow field. a surface source distribution is used as a basis for solution. this leads to a fredholm integral equation of the second kind, which is solved as a set of linear algebraic equations, usually by a modified seidel method. at the present time the solution is programed on the ibm 704 edpm to solve the flow about any body that has the previously mentioned characteristics and whose profile can be defined satisfactorily by no more than 300 coordinate points. a number of solutions are presented, to show both the scope of the method and its accuracy. computations require from three minutes to two hours, depending upon the shape of the body and the number of points used to define it.
