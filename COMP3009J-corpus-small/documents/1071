stability of thin torispherical shells under uniform internal pressure. the stability of the toroidal portion of a torispherical shell under internal pressure is considered from the point of view of the linear buckling theory. a detailed stress analysis of the prebuckled shell is made employing asymptotic integration. the change in potential energy of the shell is then minimized using a rayleigh-ritz procedure for actual computation of the critical pressure. numerical results reveal that elastic buckling may occur for very thin shells whose material has a relatively high value of the ratio of yield stress to elastic modulus.
