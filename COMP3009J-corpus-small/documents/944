one dimensional heat conduction through the skin of a vehicle upon entering a planetary atmosphere at constant velocity and entry angle. closed-form solutions of the one-dimensional heat-conduction equations for the flow of heat into a plate with a laminar boundary layer have been obtained for a configuration entering a planetary atmosphere with constant velocity and negative entry angle. the atmospheric density was assumed to obey an exponential law and the temperature was assumed constant initially. the solution is in the form of a fourier series expansion which, for most practical applications, can be approximated by retaining only one term of the expression. the solution applies to the initial part of the entry before the maximum heating conditions are encountered.
