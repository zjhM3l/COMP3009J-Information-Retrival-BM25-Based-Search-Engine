the variation of gust frequency with gust velocity and altitude. information on atmospheric turbulence obtained from counting accelerometer records is examined and relations giving the variation of gust frequency with gust velocity and altitude are obtained. the results are summarized in a form convenient for use in estimating the fatigue life of an aircraft.
