heat transfer to flat plate in high temperature rarefied ultra-high mach number flow. an investigation was conducted in a hypersonic shock tunnel to determine the local heat transfer rates for a sharp leading edge flat plate. the free stream mach number range was 7.95 to 25.1 with stagnation temperatures of approximately 2550 and 6500 r. for these temperature and mach number conditions, the strong interaction parameter, varied from 2.35 to 826. the corresponding knudsen numbers, based on the ratio of the free stream mean free path and the leading edge thickness, varied from 0.38 to 85.5. for free stream mach numbers greater than 10, knudsen numbers of approximately unity, and perfect gas conditions, the calculated heat transfer coefficients were found to vary as as predicted by the noninsulated flat plate theory of li and nagamatsu. for the case of, the leading edge slip phenomenon drastically reduced the local heat transfer coefficients as compared to the theoretical values predicted with no slip at the surface. for the extreme case of and, the measured local heat transfer rate was an order of magnitude less than the analytical value. both the knudsen number and the free stream mach number are important physical parameters that determine the extent of the slip-flow region.
