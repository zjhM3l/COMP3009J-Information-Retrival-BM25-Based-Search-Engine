the transverse curvature effect in compressible axially symmetric laminar boundary layer flow. the viscous transverse curvature effect in compressible axially symmetric laminar boundary-layer flow has been investigated, and it is found that the effect is characterized by the parameter which is essentially the ratio of the boundary-layer thickness to body radius. it is shown that the busemann and crocco integrals of the two-dimensional energy equation for are still valid for axially symmetric flow in which the transverse curvature effects are considered. by a generalization of mangler's transformation it is then shown that the boundary-layer equations are reducible to an almost two-dimensional form, making the analysis simpler for two asymptotic flow regions characterized by and less than or of the order of unity. it is with the latter region that the present paper is primarily concerned, and for this case it is shown that the additional term in the momentum and energy equations, which differentiates them from the two-dimensional form, behaves like an external favorable pressure gradient. except for certain special cases it is necessary to obtain the of the order of unity by means of asymptotic expansions in ascending powers of a parameter that is small compared to unity but proportional to. it is shown how the asymptotic solutions can be found for (1) the velocity and temperature distributions for the compressible zero pressure gradient case when the body shapes are given by and and (2) the velocity distribution for incompressible flow with an external velocity of the form past a body given by. the zeroth approximation is the mangler result. for the cases of a linear external velocity distribution, similar profiles can be found for all values of. more generally it is shown that similar profiles exist if the exponents n and m satisfy the condition that. here, similar is used in the restricted meaning that the distributions are derivable from ordinary differential equations. in the case of the cone and cylinder with zero pressure gradient where the equations have been numerically integrated for, the first-order correction to the mangler formulation shows that the effect on both the skin-friction coefficient and heat-transfer rate can become appreciable in the range where is less than or of the order of unity. at a constant, the effects are increased in magnitude when either the ratio of wall to free-stream temperature, or mach number, is increased. also, all other conditions being equal, for the same value of the skin-friction coefficient and heat-transfer increase on the cylinder is greater than that on the cone. for flows with pressure gradient, the transverse curvature term behaves again like a favorable pressure gradient and tends to delay both separation and transition when compared with axially symmetric flows in which the transverse curvature effect is neglected.
