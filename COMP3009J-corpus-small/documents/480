adiabatic wall temperature due to mass transfer cooling with a combustible gas. a recent technical note by sutton (1), with the above title, discusses the influence of the burning of a transpiration coolant on the quantity of coolant necessary to maintain a given wall temperature. the present note discusses the same problem in a way which has been found useful in calculating the burning rates of solid and liquid fuels (2). consider the transpiration cooling of a porous surface in a gas stream. then a simple modification of the general mass.
