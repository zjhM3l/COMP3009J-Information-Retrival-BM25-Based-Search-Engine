compressible laminar flow and heat transfer about a rotating isothermal disk. the flow and heat transfer about a rotating isothermal disk are re-examined to include the effects of compressibility and property variations. if viscous dissipation is neglected, the compressible problem is correlated to the incompressible problem by assuming linear variations of viscosity and thermal conductivity with temperature. certain inaccuracies in several previous incompressible solutions are noted and corrected herein. the effect of compressibility appears as a distortion of the normal coordinate and normal velocity component and as a multiplicative factor in the heat-transfer coefficient, the nusselt number, and in the expressions for the skin-friction components and torque required to rotate the disk.
