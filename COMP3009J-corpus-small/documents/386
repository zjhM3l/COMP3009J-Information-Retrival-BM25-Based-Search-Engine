a generalised porous-wall ?couette type? flow. recently, it was observed that the two existing boundary-layer texts (references 1 and 2) did not contain a solution for the case of couette flow with a constant, uniformly distributed suction or blowing. thus, the following analysis considers a /couette-type/ flow between a stationary flat surface and a slightly inclined flat plate moving at a constant velocity. in addition, the flow is subjected to a constant, uniformly distributed suction or blowing at the fixed surface.
