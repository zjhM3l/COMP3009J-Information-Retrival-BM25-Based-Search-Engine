tabulated solutions of the equilibrium gas properties behind the incidents and reflected normal shock-wave in a shock-tube. tabulated solutions are presented for the equilibrium gas properties behind the incident and reflected normal shock-waves in the shock-tube, for nitrogen and oxygen. they cover the range of shock-wave mach numbers up to 12 at intervals of undisturbed gas pressure between 1 and the thermodynamic model of the gas used in the calculations is described in some detail, as is the method of solving the equations. the limitations of the assumption of thermodynamic equilibrium are discussed with regard to shock-tube applications, and the estimated accuracy of the tables is indicated.
