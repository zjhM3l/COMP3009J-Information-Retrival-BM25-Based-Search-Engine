atmosphere entries with spacecraft lift-drag ratios modulated to limit decelerations. an analysis has been made of atmosphere entries for which the spacecraft lift-drag ratios were modulated to limit the maximum deceleration. the parts of the drag polars used during modulation were from maximum lift coefficient to minimum drag coefficient. five drag polars of different shapes were assumed for the spacecraft. the entries covered wide ranges of initial velocity, initial flight-path angle, initial and maximum lift-drag ratio. two-dimensional trajectory calculations were made for a nonrotating, spherical earth with an exponential atmosphere. the results of the analysis indicate for four of the five drag polars that, relative to the maximum deceleration of an unmodulated entry at maximum lift-drag ratio, the greatest reduction in maximum deceleration obtainable by modulation depends upon a single parameter. this parameter is the ratio of the value of the aerodynamic resultant-force coefficient at minimum drag coefficient to the value at maximum lift coefficient. thus, the reduction in maximum deceleration is independent of initial velocity, initial flight-path angle, initial maximum lift-drag ratio, and the shape of the drag polar. for the fifth drag polar, the reduction in maximum deceleration was found to depend upon the maximum lift-drag ratio. also, relative to the depth of a given deceleration-limited corridor, the greatest increase in corridor depth obtainable by modulation (for four of the five drag polars) depends upon the same ratio of aerodynamic resultant-force coefficients. the fractional increase in corridor depth can be expressed as an empirically determined analytical function of this ratio.
