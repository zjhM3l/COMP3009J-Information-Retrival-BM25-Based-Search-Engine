an investigation of the pressure distribution on conical bodies in hypersonic flows. a large amount of work on conical flow fields without axial symmetry at supersonic speed is presently available. however, no apparent hypersonic approximation has yet been derived. in this note, experimental data on two elliptical cones at m = 6 are presented and a hypersonic approach obtained from physical considerations is suggested.
