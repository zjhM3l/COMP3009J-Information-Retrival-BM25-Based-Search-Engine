a note on the explosion solution of sedov with application to the newtonian theory of unsteady hypersonic flow. an exact analytical solution of the equations of inviscid compressible unsteady flow has been given by sedov (reference to the solution may be made through hayes and probstein). this solution is the similarity solution for a constant-energy point explosion. in view of the recent work on problems of hypersonic flow in the limiting form of the ratio of specific heats near 1 solution in this limit and inquire what form such a solution would take. einbinder, in a recent note, has examined the solution for various but does not mention the interesting case of. it may be shown that the convergence to the limit is nonuniform over the flow field. it is also not difficult to show that the non- uniform behavior exhibited here is that which one would expect from the newtonian formulation as derived in reference 3.
