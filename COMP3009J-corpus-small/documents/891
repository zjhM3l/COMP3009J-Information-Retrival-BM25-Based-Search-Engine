buckling of a finite length cylindrical shell under a circumferential band of pressure. this paper is concerned with buckling of a circular cylinder of finite length subjected to a symmetrical band of external pressure. both experimental and theoretical results are presented. the experimental data were obtained from tests of three thin-walled steel cylinders subjected to external pressure by a pneumatic tube encircling the test cylinder at mid-length. the theory is based on the principle of minimum potential energy, and the rayleigh-ritz procedure is used to expand the displacement components in trigonometric series. theoretical results are given in the form of graphs which show buckling pressure as a function of the following ratios.. cylinder radius thickness cylinder length radius pressure bandwidth cylinder length theoretical results are in close agreement with existing solutions to special cases in which (1) the pressure is applied over the entire lateral surface, and (2) the pressure is concentrated along a circumferential line. the theoretical results are also in agreement with the test results.
