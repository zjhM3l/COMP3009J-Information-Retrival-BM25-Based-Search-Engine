nearly circular transfer trajectories for descending satellites. simplified expressions describing the transfer from a satellite orbit to the point of atmospheric entry are derived. the expressions are limited to altitude changes that are small compared with the earth's radius, and velocity changes small compared with satellite velocity. they are further restricted to motion about a spherical, nonrotating earth. the transfer orbit resulting from the application of thrust in any direction at any point in an elliptic orbit is considered. expressions for the errors in distance (miss distance) and entry angle due to an initial misalinement and magnitude error of the deflecting thrust are presented. the largest potential contributing factor towards a miss distance stems from the misalinement of the retrovelocity increment. if this velocity increment is pointed in direct opposition to the flight path, a 1 misalinement leads to a miss distance of 34.5 miles. however, it is shown that this error can be avoided by applying the velocity increment at an angle between 120 and 150 below the flight-path direction. the guidance and accuracy requirements to establish a circular orbit, in addition to the corrections applied to transform elliptic orbits into circular ones, are also discussed.
