on the theory of thin elastic shells. general equations for the symmetrical finite deflection of a rotationally symmetric thin shell are first obtained. for small deflections these equations are reduced to a pair of equations for the change of slope of the shell surface and the product of the undeformed radius of the shell to the radial stress. this choice of dependent variable is shown to be advantageous. two cases of shallow shells give particularly simple solutions.. parabolic shells of nth degree and uniform thickness, and parabolic shells of mth degree with thickness varying as mth power of the distance from the apex. for the first case, the solutions can be expressed in terms of cylinder functions,. for the second, in powers of the paper concludes with a discussion of the asymptotic solutions for small thickness.
