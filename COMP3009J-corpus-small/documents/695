some experiments relating to the problem of simulation of hot jet engines in studies of jet effects on adjacent surfaces at a free-stream mach number of 1.80. an investigation at a free-stream mach number of 1.80 in a blowdown type tunnel was made to study the effect on the pressure distribution of a zero angle of attack wing surface when certain exhaust parameters of a hot turbojet engine are varied. static-pressure surveys were made on a wing surface that was located in the vicinity of a small-scale propulsive jet. this propulsive jet was operated with four types of jet exhausts. these jet exhausts were a hot jet /hydrogen burned in air/, a cold air jet, a cold helium jet, and a jet composed of a mixture of two cold gases /hydrogen and carbon dioxide/. the hot jet, because of its high exhaust temperature /3,300degreer/ and because combustion was performed in air, was believed reasonably able to simulate the exhaust parameters of an actual afterburning turbojet engine. the cold jets used were selected in order that the effects of a variation in the exhaust parameters of jet-exit static-pressure ratio, ratio of specific heats, density, and velocity, could be obtained by comparing each cold jet with the hot jet or with another cold jet. the tests were made over a range of jet-exit staticpressure ratios from 1 to 9 with values of the ratio of specific heats of 1.27, 1.40, and 1.66 and at variations in density and velocity of the order of approximately 8 and 3 times, respectively. within the scope of this investigation, it was found that jet-exit static-pressure ratio and the ratio of specific heats affected the pressure distribution on the wing associated with jet interference while a variation in exit velocity and density did not. the jet-exit staticpressure ratio affected the wing pressure distribution in a major way while the ratio of specific heats had only a minor effect. the addition of temperature in the propulsive jet exhaust at a jet-exit staticpressure ratio of 4 had little or no effect on the pressure distribution associated with jet interference on the wing.
