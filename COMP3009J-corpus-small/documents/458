a new series for calculation of steady laminar boundary layer flows. a new and general method for solving problems of plane and steady laminar boundary layer flows in incompressible fluids with arbitrary outer pressure distribution is developed. this method is based on the introduction of the dimensionless quantities as new independent spatial variables. ordinates, u(x) the given outer velocity distribution, v the kinematic viscosity.) the solution of the boundary layer problem is then given as a power series in e with coefficient functions depending on n. this series is a formally exact solution of the boundary layer problem. the new series solution has the following qualities.. have the significance only of cartesian coordinates, the influence of wall curvature being neglected in boundary layer theory, the new coordinates are adjusted to the data of the special problem in any case of application. the new variables represent a logical development of former efforts in the field of boundary-layer flow calculation. with other series solutions known for some special cases is that the leading term of the new series satisfies exactly the outer boundary condition at all cross-sections along the wall. therefore, the succeeding terms give corrections only in the inner part of the boundary layer. accordingly, taking also no. 1 into account, the zero order term by itself gives a good approximation for the boundary layer flow.
