newtonian flow over a surface. a general method is presented for the study of a three-dimensional hypersonic flow about a body of arbitrary shape when. the manner of constructing a double asymptotic development in and is shown. formulae are given which enable the first three terms of this development to be obtained while neglecting. the theory is then applied to the case of a body of circular-cone shape. the pressure is given as a triple development in accordance with the preceding parameters and the angle of attack,. this development neglects. a. ferri's vortical layer is brought into evidence. a second application is devoted to calculation of the total forces acting upon bodies of revolution at angles of incidence, while neglecting. general formulae are established for the coefficients of axial force, normal force and moments. the formulae are developed according to the powers of incidence, the first terms of each formula being of very simple form.
