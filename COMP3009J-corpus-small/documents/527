note on the three-point boundary layer problem for the blasius equations. in a recent paper a method was presented for obtaining higher accuracy in the numerical solution of the blasius equation with three-point boundary conditions. the well-known blasius equation was previously developed in an investigation of the steady two-dimensional incompressible boundary-layer flow over a flat plate, but it has been extensively used in investigating other fluid flow problems. the three-point boundary-value problem is encountered in the theory of laminar mixing and in approximate analyses of separated and wake flows as noted in ref. 1.
