asymptotic solutions of toroidal shell problems. method of asymptotic integration developed by e. reissner and author is refined, and solutions previously obtained for problems of bending of curved tube and of a toroidal expansion joint subject to an axial force are generalized and extended. results are compared to those obtained by l. beskin. for large values of a certain parameter, agreement is good.
