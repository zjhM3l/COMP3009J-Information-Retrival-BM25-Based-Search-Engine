pressure distribution induced on a flat plate at a free-stream mach number of 1.39 by rockets exhausting upstream and downstream. an experimental investigation was made of the pressures induced on a flat plate at a free-stream mach number of 1.39 by a supersonic rocket jet exhausting upstream and downstream. measurements of the pressure distribution on a flat plate were made at zero angle of attack for 11 different locations of the jet exhaust nozzle beneath the wing. measurements were made at ratios of rocket-exit total pressure to free-stream static pressure from 6 to 60 and at a reynolds number per foot of approximately 10 times 10 to the power of 6. the rocket when exhausted upstream produced a strong shock that moved further upstream with increasing rocket-exit total-pressure ratio. positive incremental normal-force coefficients were obtained at all test positions. data at 11 test positions are tabulated for rocket-on and rocket-off pressure coefficients as well as for incremental pressure coefficients for the 48 orifices of the flat plate for the range of ratio of rocket-exit total pressure to free-stream static pressure of the investigation. changing the location of the model with respect to the plate had a negligible effect when the rocket was varied in the chordwise direction, but the pressure coefficients were reduced as the rocket was lowered away from the flat-plate wing.
