the uniform section disk spring. the authors point out in this paper that initially coned annular-disk springs of uniform cross section may be proportioned to give a wide variety of load-deflection curves not readily obtainable with the more conventional forms of springs, and that, although the versatility of this type spring has long been indicated, the formulas available have not been presented in a manner to disclose readily the effect of spring proportions on characteristics. therefore the authors have derived the formulas presented in this paper with the intention that the formulas will aid the designer in arriving at suitable characteristics by choice of spring geometry. these new formulas have been in use for several years at the general motors corporation research laboratories section, and their reliability has been checked by tests of springs used in a variety of special test equipment.
