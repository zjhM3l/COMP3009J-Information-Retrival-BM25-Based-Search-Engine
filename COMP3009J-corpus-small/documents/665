on the theory of hypersonic gas flow with a power law shock wave. plane and axisymmetric hypersonic gas flows are considered with shock waves of very great intensity that have a power-law form. on the basis of an investigation of the portions of the flow with high entropy adjoining the surface of the body (not necessarily for a shock wave of the given form) it is shown that the use in the flow problem of the exact solution for the corresponding unsteady self-similar gas motion requires a supplementary refinement of the thickness of the high entropy layer. a method is shown for introducing such a correction and constructing the shape of the body contour, on which is to be applied the pressure distribution obtained on the basis of the theory of small disturbances.
