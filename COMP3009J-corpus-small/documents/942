secondary gas injection in a conical rocket nozzle. data are presented on side forces generated by secondary gas injection in a 15 conical rocket exhaust nozzle. the side force was measured directly with a force transducer and the data examined in terms of an amplification factor, where is the measured effective specific impulse of injectant, and is the specific impulse of injectant for sonic flow into a vacuum. injection was normal to the axis of the nozzle through a single circular orifice at a fixed point in the diverging portion of the nozzle. a variety of ambient temperature gaseous injectants and orifice diameters were carefully studied. injectant flow rate was varied for each configuration. the main propellant was hot gas ( catalytically decomposed), and motor conditions were held essentially constant.
