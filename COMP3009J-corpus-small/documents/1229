the effect of sweep angle on hypersonic flow over blunt wings. a series of tests were carried out in the princeton university helium hypersoule wind tunnel on blunt two-dimensional wings at zero angle of attack with sweep angles up to 70 at mach numbers from 7 to 15. the leading edge reynolds number varied from 3,000 to 25,000. the measured pressure distributions were compared with the simple summation of the theoretical inviscid effect (based on blast wave theory using the normal mach number) added to the viscous effect (calculated as if no sweep were present). for the unswept wing, the slope of the pressure decay was reasonably well predicted by the theoretical calculations. the viscous theory reasonably predicted the variation in the pressure distribution due to changes in leading-edge reynolds number. by subtracting the theoretical viscous effects, an inviscid mach number dependence of the 2.2 power was found as compared to the value of 2.0 predicted by the inviscid theory. the same approach for the swept wing did not give consistently satisfactory results. deviations avove and below the calculated value by as much as 40-50 percent were measured and there seemed to be no systematic variation with either mach number or reynolds number. at a constant high reynolds number, it was found that the pressure distribution varied with the distance along the wing with an exponent between about--0.53 and--0.58 except for a rather sharp decrease which occurred for the 70 sweep case. the pressure at a given station for a fixed mach number and given leading edge thickness varied as the cosine of the sweep angle to the 1.1 power as compared to the 1.3 power predicted from general geometrical considerations.
