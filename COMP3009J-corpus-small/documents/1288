analysis of the fluid mechanics of secondary injection for thrust vector control. an analysis is made of the interaction of an injected gas or liquid with a supersonic stream, and the force induced on an adjacent wall is predicted. the study deals only with the freestream-injectant interaction,. the modifications to the flow introduced by the boundary layer are not considered. in the case of liquids, it is shown that the momentum deficit of the injectant relative to the freestream may play a larger part in producing the side force than the volume generation by vaporization and reaction. the analytical results are compared with those obtained from experiments in a wind tunnel and in nozzles.
