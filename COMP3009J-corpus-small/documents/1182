an approximate solution for laminar boundary layer flow. this paper presents an approximate solution for two-dimensional, incompressible, laminar boundary layer flow with arbitrary pressure gradient. von mises' form of the boundary layer equation is linearized by making a change in the coefficient of one of the terms. the linearized equation yields a solution that is accurate for the outer portion of the flow but inaccurate near the surface. a separate inner solution then is developed which is accurate at the surface and which joins with the outer solution at some point within the boundary layer. the method may be considered a major modification of one developed earlier by von karman and millikan, with changes in both outer and inner solutions, and the point at which the two solutions are joined. the changes improve the accuracy of the method and in some respects simplify the calculations. as examples, results are presented for flow with a linear variation of velocity (including flat plate and stagnation point flow as special cases), flow with sinusoidal variation of velocity, flow past a circular cylinder (heimenz' velocity distribution), and flow past an ellipse (schubauer's data). agreement with theoretically exact solutions is good, and better than results obtained using the pohlhausen method.
