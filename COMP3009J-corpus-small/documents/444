an approach to the flutter problem in real fluids. an approximate theory of airfoils in unsteady motion in a viscous fluid is proposed, in which viscous effects are accounted for by relaxing the kutta condition and replacing it by a relation derived from experiments in steady flow. applications here, are limited to moderate viscous effects below the stall. the possibility of one-degree- of-freedom flutter is discussed under this assumption. the discussion is partly extrapolated to the domain of stall flutter. some possibilities of further development of this theory for the stalled case are indicated.
