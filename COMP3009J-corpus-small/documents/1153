a study of the simulation of flow with free stream mach number 1 in a choked wind tunnel. the degree to which experimental results obtained under choking conditions in a wind tunnel with solid walls simulate those associated with an unbounded flow with free-stream mach number 1 is investigated for the cases of two-dimensional and axisymmetric flows. it is found that a close resemblance does indeed exist in the vicinity of the body, and that the results obtained in this way are generally at least as accurate as those obtained in a transonic wind tunnel with partly open test section. some of the results indicate, however, that substantial interference effects, particularly those of the wave reflection type, may be encountered under certain conditions, both in choked wind tunnels and in transonic wind tunnels, and that the reduction of these interference effects to acceptable limits may require the use of models of unusually small size.
