an experimental and theoretical investigation of second-order supersonic wing-body interference, for a non-lifting body with wings at incidence. pressure distributions on the wing of two wing-body combinations are measured experimentally at mach numbers 3 and 4 with the wing at various incidences in the range 0degree to 10degree. the results are compared with theoretical results which include interference effects calculated according to the second-order supersonic wing-body interference theory due to landahl and beane /1/. this theory, having been tested previously for non-lifting wing-body combinations, is thus tested also for wings at incidence. the agreement between theory and experiment is found to vary with mach number and wing sweepback. for the higher mach number and moderate sweepback the theory gives a good prediction of pressure distribution, but for the most adverse condition of low mach number and large sweepback the theory is found to overestimate the interference effects. this is expected as the theory assumes the sweepback of the wings is small compared with that of the mach line. an empirical guide to the limit of application of the interference theory is given. within this limit the agreement between theory and experiment is found to deteriorate only a little with increase of incidence, over the range tested.
