analysis and calculation by integral methods of laminar compressible boundary layer with heat transfer and with and without pressure gradient. a survey of integral methods in laminar-boundary-layer analysis is first given. a simple and sufficiently accurate method for practical purposes of calculating the properties layer in an axial pressure gradient with heat transfer at the wall is then presented. for flow over a flat plate, the method is applicable for an arbitrarily prescribed distribution of temperature along the surface and for any given constant prandtl number close to unity. for flow in a pressure gradient, the method is based on a prandtl number of unity and a uniform wall temperature. a simple and accurate method of determining the separation point in a compressible flow with an adverse pressure gradient over a surface at a given uniform wall temperature is developed. the analysis is based on an extension of the karman-pohlhausen method to the momentum and thermal energy equations in conjunction with fourth- and especially higher degree velocity and stagnation-enthalpy profiles. from the equations derived here, conclusions regarding the effect of pressure gradient, mach number, and wall temperature on the boundary-layer characteristics are derived and illustrated. in particular the effects on skin-friction, heat-transfer coefficient, separation point in an adverse pressure gradient, and stability of the laminar boundary layer are analyzed.
