minimum wing wave drag with volume constraint. a numerical method is developed for calculating the minimum thickness drag for a given wing planform and volume using linearized supersonic flow theory. the corresponding optimum volume distribution is also determined. the results show that considerable drag reduction is possible by improved volume distribution.
