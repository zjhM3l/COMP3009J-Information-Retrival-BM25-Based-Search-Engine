non-linear shallow shell analysis by the matrix force method. the matrix force method of redundant structure analysis is currently being extended by various users to cover a number of non-linear problems. one of these is the non-linear analysis of heated cambered wings, such as might be used in advanced flight vehicles. in this case the approach used by the present authors is equally applicable to shallow shells, the formulation of the strain-displacement and equilibrium relations being a finite element equivalent to that used by marguerre. the solution is obtained by a combined iteration and step by step procedure utilizing a tangent flexibility matrix. divergence in the calculations indicates that the range of stable configurations has been exceeded. cambered plates subjected to several loadings are given as examples,. for one, an exact solution is available for comparison. it is believed that the basic concepts involved in this shallow shell analysis can be extended to apply to other, more general shell instability problems, and that useful solutions to the latter are probably within the capability of present day digital computers.
