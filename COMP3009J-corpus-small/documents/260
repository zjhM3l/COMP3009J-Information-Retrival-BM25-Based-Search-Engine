a critical review of skin friction and heat transfer solutions of the laminar boundary layer of a flat plate. a review is made of existing literature concerned with the analytical investigation of the velocity and temperature distributions in the boundary layers of a heated (or cooled) flat plate. the plate is postulated infinitely thin and is parallel to a uniform fluid stream. the more recent solutions include the combined effects of frictional dissipation and variable fluid properties. only the results pertaining to the transfer phenomena occurring at the plate surface are included, i.e., skin drag and over-all heat transfer,. the individual temperature and velocity distributions leading to these results are omitted.
