small bending and stretching of sandwich type shells. a theory has been developed for small bending and stretching of sandwich-type shells. this theory is an extension of the known theory of homogeneous thin elastic shells. it was found that two effects are important in the present problem, which have not been considered previously in the theory of curved shells.. (1) the effect of transverse shear deformation and (2) the effect of transverse normal stress deformation. the first of these two effects has been known to be of importance in the theory of plates and beams. the second effect was found to occur in a manner which is typical for shells and has no counterpart in flat-plate theory. the general results of this report have been applied to the solution of problems concerning flat plates, circular rings, circular cylindrical shells, and spherical shells. in each case numerical examples have been given, illustrating the magnitude of the effects of transverse shear and normal stress deformation. the results of this investigation indicate the necessity of taking account of transverse shear and normal stress in sandwich-type shells, as soon as there is an order-of-magnitude difference between the elastic constants of the core layer and of the face layers of the composite shell. it was found that the changes due to transverse shear and normal stress deformation in the core may be so large as to be no mere corrections to the results of the theory without transverse core flexibility. the actual magnitude of the changes is greatly dependent on the geometry and loading condition of the structure under consideration so that no general rules may be given which indicate for which elastic modulus ratio the changes begin to be significant. solutions of problems in the present theory may in general be obtained by mathematical methods which are similar to those employed in the theory of plates and shells without the effect of transverse shear and normal stress deformation included. the present work does not include consideration of buckling and finite deflection effects.
