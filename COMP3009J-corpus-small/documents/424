cantilever plate with concentrated edge load. the author gives, by the method of finite differences, an approximate solution of the problem of a finite length of a cantilever plate which bears a concentrated load at the longitudinal free edge. all the boundary conditions are taken into account, and the plate action is determined approximately at all points of the plate. the author points out that a secondary maximum transverse stress occurs at the clamped edge nearest the loading point, and that the longitudinal stress is greatest directly under the loading point.
