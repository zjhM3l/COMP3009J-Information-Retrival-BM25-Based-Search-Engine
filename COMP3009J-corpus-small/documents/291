sweepback effects in the turbulent boundary-layer shock-wave interaction. experiments are reported on the interaction of turbulent boundary layers and shock waves with sweptback configurations. they show that the peak pressure rise at separation, the upstream influence ahead of separation, and the pressure rise at reattachment for moderate sweep angles can all be understood by simple extensions of available two-dimensional theories.
