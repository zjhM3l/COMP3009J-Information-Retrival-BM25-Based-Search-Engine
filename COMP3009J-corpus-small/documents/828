stresses and small displacements of shallow spherical shells. the purpose of the present paper is to derive a system of equations which can be used for the analysis of shallow segments of thin, elastic, spherical shells. a segment will be called shallow if the ratio of its height to base diameter is less than, say. the results obtained on the basis of this assumption will often also be applicable to shells which are not shallow, namely then, when the loads are such that the stresses are effectively restricted to shallow zones. the problem of the spherical elastic shell has been the subject of numerous researches. for the rotationally symmetric case the fundamental results were obtained in 1912 (1) and have been the starting point of many applications. while it is possible to deduce from these results approximate equations equivalent to part of what follows, it is believed that the present approach to the problem of the shallow shell may be of some interest even for rotationally symmetric cases. a number of investigations have been concerned with the shell loaded in a non-rotationally symmetric manner (2,3,4). in its general form this problem is quite difficult and the results so far obtained are not easy to apply. restricting attention to the shallow shell in the manner of the present paper brings with it a very considerable simplification of the analysis.
