on the solution of the laminar boundary layer equations. the theory of the laminar boundary layer offers a means of determining the skin friction under the assumption of a given velocity distribution outside the boundary layer. owing to the mathematical difficulties, however, exact solutions are possible only when the velocity distribution is expressed as a simple function of the distance along the surface. more complicated velocity distributions necessitate recourse to the method of expansion in series or that of step-by-step calculations, but the labor involved is too great for the methods to be of practical use. approximate method due to pohlhausen (1921), which had long been recommended for general use, gives a reasonably accurate solution in a region of accelerated flow, but recently its adequacy in a region of retarded flow has been questioned. separation of flow may actually occur where the solution of pohlhausen fails to give it. more recently howarth solution, which gives fairly reasonable results in a region of retarded flow. howarth's solution essentially consists in solving the boundary layer equations for the particular case in which the velocity u outside the boundary layer decreases linearly with the distance x measured along the surface, and utilizing the solution by replacing the actual distribution of u by a circumscribing polygon of infinitesimal sides. therefore, it is assumed that the velocity distribution at any section depends on the velocity gradient du/dx at that section only, being affected by the conditions upstream only in so far as this affects the momentum thickness 0. in other words, the velocity distribution across the boundary layer is determined by a parameter.
