an investigation of the influence of lift on sonic-boom intensity by means of wind tunnel measurements of the pressure fields of several wing-body combinations at a mach number of 2. 01. an investigation of the effect of lift on sonic-boom intensity has been performed by means of wind-tunnel measurements of the pressure fields surrounding small wing-body combinations. the tests were conducted in the langley 4- by 4-foot supersonic pressure tunnel at a mach number of per foot. effects of lift were found to be real and significant. measured bow-shock intensities agreed fairly well with, but were consistently less than, shock intensities estimated by theoretical methods. available flight data were examined for correlation with wind-tunnel test results.
