dynamic stability of a missile in rolling flight. the paper sets down the equations of motion for a symmetric rolling missile with respect to axes attached to the missile. the missile may be jet (or rocket) propelled or coasting under accelerating or decelerating conditions, respectively, wherein the variable rolling velocity is derived from intentionally or unintentionally /canted/ fins and or wings. the equations contain a force and moment system that includes, in addition to the usual forces and moments, those due to magnus effects, misaligned surfaces, canted surfaces, jet misalignment, and the linear accelerations in the plane normal to the missile axis. the results present general stability criteria for a rolling missile which are summarized in the /discussion of stability./
