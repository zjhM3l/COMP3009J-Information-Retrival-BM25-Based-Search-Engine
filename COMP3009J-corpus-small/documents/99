the fundamentals of the statistical theory of turbulence. statistical theory in general considers mean values of certain quantities. in the case of the turbulent motion one is interested in mean values of velocities and of their derivatives, and in mean values of squares and products of velocities and their derivatives. it was o. reynolds who first expressed the so-called apparent or turbulent stresses by the mean values of the products of the velocity components. the different theories suggested so far have as their common objective the establishment of relations between certain mean values, e.g. between the turbulent shear stresses given by the mean products of velocity fluctuations and the derivatives of the mean velocities, i.e. the measured mean velocity gradients. in this sort of investigations the conception of the /correlation/ is of paramount importance. the late a. friedman tried to introduce the correlations as unknown variables in the hydrodynamic equations., however, he could not carry his investigations to practical results, i.e., to results which can be compared with the experimental evidence. recently, g. i. taylor had success in his analysis of /isotropic/ turbulence by means of correlation calculations, and was able to discuss, theoretically, the problem of the decay of turbulence in a windstream behind a turbulence producing device. his theory raised considerable interest because it is concerned with the important problem of wind-tunnel turbulence and its results could be compared directly with experimental work done by dryden in this country and by fage, townend and simmons in england. the present paper is concerned with two fundamental problems.. with uniform isotropic turbulence and with the turbulent friction in a parallel stream. first, the general theory of isotropic turbulence is developed. this general theory includes taylor's consideration as a special case. however, it
