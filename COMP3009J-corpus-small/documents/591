an approximate equation for the /choke line/ of a compressor. discussion of a similarity between the pressure-ratio versus inlet-mass-flow-coefficient characteristic of a stream or gas turbine and the analogous characteristic of an expansion /laval/ nozzle. this idea is extended to a compressor and a compression nozzle, and an approximate expression for the /choke line/ of the compressor is developed.
