determination of upper-atmosphere air density and scale height from satellite observations. a solution is obtained for the rate of change of semi-major axis and perigee distance of a satellite orbit with time due to the resistance of the atmosphere. the logarithm of air density is assumed to vary quadratically with height, and the oblateness of the atmosphere is taken into account. the calculation of perigee air density in terms of the rate of change of satellite period is dealt with,. and the method is applied to data at present available on six different satellites. the variation of air density with height is obtained as in p-28.59/0.15/-h-200//46/5/0.028/0.013//h-200///46/ for h in the range of approximately 170 to 700 km, where p is in grams/c m, h is in kilometres and standard deviations are given in brackets.
