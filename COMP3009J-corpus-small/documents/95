temperature distribution and thermal stresses in a model of a supersonic wing. the transient temperature distribution and the thermal stresses in an idealized wing structure considered by hoff and torda in reference 1 are determined. only the effects of aerodynamic heating and of heat conduction are included,. radiation and convection effects are neglected. the present work differs from that of reference 1 in that the conduction from the cap to the web is considered when the temperature of the cap is calculated, and the spar cap temperature is assumed to be a function of both space and time. graphs of temperature and thermal stress distributions are presented, and the results are compared with those of reference 1.
