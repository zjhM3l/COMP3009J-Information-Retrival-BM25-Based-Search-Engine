engineering relations for friction and heat transfer to surfaces in high velocity flow. in calculations of thermodynamic heating for high speed missiles parameters have been used based on relationships which hold for constant-property fluids. the validity of this procedure has been verified recently in a survey of heat transfer in which a relationship for the reference temperature was developed. a calculation procedure for laminar and turbulent boundary layers, based on this relationship, is given.
