remarks on the eddy viscosity in compressible mixing flows. in connection with a study of the wakes behind bodies in hypersonic flow carried out for the missile and space vehicle division of the general electric company, it was desired to estimate the eddy viscosity in axisymmetric, compressible wakes. because of the lack of applicable experimental data, it was found necessary to make such an estimate by rationally extending the few available data for incompressible flows to the compressible case. this suggested the application and extension of the transformations applied to turbulent boundary layers in reference infinitesimal mass are invariant with transformation, mager showed that the partial differential equations for the compressible turbulent boundary layer can be transformed to incompressible form. the validity of this assumption and of the transformations was established for several boundary-layer flows by comparison with experiment.
