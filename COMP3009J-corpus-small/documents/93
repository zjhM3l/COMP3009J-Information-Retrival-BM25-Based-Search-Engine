the supersonic blunt body problem - review and extensions. a survey of existing analytical treatments of the supersonic or hypersonic blunt-body problem indicates that none is adequate for predicting the details of the flow field. reasons are given for the failure of various plausible approximations. a numerical method, which is simpler than others proposed, is set forth for solving the full inviscid equations using a medium-sized electronic computer. results are shown from a number of solutions for bodies that support detached shock waves described by conic sections.
