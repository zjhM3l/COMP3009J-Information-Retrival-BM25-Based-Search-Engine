heat transfer near the forward stagnation point of a body of revolution. in order to determine the temperature distribution over a body moving through the atmosphere, a knowledge of the local heat-transfer coefficients is required. for slender sharp-nosed bodies, the heat-transfer coefficients are frequently approximated by using the comparable flat-plate values. however, for blunt-nosed bodies, flat-plate solutions are not applicable near the forward stagnation point. since the greatest rate of heat transfer may occur at the forward stagnation point, its value should be investigated. in this note a theoretical solution is given for the heat transfer near the forward stagnation point of a body of revolution assuming laminar, incompressible, low-speed flow. the comparable solution for two-dimensional flow has been given by squire. in the case of a blunt-nosed body moving with supersonic velocity, the flow behind the central portion of the bow wave is subsonic, and it is possible that a low-speed solution, using as /free-stream/ conditions those behind the center of the bow wave, will apply near the stagnation point.
