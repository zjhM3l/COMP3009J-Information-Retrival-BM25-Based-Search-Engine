supersonic flow past slender bodies with discontinuous profile slope. ward's slender-body theory is extended to derive first approximations to the external forces on slender bodies of general cross section with discontinuous profile slope. two classes of body are considered.. bodies whose profile (typified by the local radius) is continuous between the nose and base, and certain bodies whose profile is discontinuous, such as bodies with annular or side air intakes and wing-bodies on which the wing has an unswept leading edge. (where air intakes are concerned, it is assumed that they are sharp-edged and that there is no /spillage/ of the internal flow). the following conclusions apply to the former class of bodies. the variation of drag with mach number is found to depend only on the discontinuities in the longitudinal rate of change of the cross-sectional area, and is thus independent of cross-sectional shape. the drag itself is unchanged if the direction of the flow is reversed. the expressions for lift and moment assume the same forms as for smooth pointed bodies, the lift depending only on conditions at the base of the body. the general theory is applied to winged bodies of revolution with an unswept wing leading edge.. the results bear a marked resemblance to those obtained by ward. the results for wings alone are seen to be applicable, with one modification, to subsonic as well as to supersonic speeds.
