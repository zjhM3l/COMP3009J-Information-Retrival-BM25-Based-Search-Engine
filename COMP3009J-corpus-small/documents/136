recent developments in rocket nozzle configurations. existing configurations of supersonic portion of rocket nozzles are described and compared. survey covers bell-type conical and contoured nozzles, annular nozzles, plug nozzles, and the author's own /e-d/ (expansion-deflection) nozzle. the latter is a bell-type nozzle in which the gases are first deflected radially outward by a small central plug, then expanded radially inward around the base of the plug, and finally deflected back to a nearly axial direction by the nozzle wall, in compressive turning.
