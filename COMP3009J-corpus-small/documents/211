effect of slight blunting of leading edge of an immersed body on the flow around it at hypersonic speed. manufacturing and maintainance of ideally sharp leading edges and noses is practically impossible, hence a discrepancy arises between the theory established for sharp edges and actual flow around slightly blunted edges, where a detached shock is formed with a subsonic adjacent region. semi-empirical method is worked out showing that the pressure distribution in the vicinity of the leading edge is the same for different thin profiles having the same shape of bluntness on their edges or noses. the data for a flat plate can be used for all of them. for moderate supersonic speed the pressure on the remaining body is practically unaffected by the nose bluntness, and can be computed from a sharp-edge theory. for high supersonic speed a slight blunting of the edge can considerably alter the pattern of flow over a large region. the method consists in replacing blunted edge by action of concentrated forces on the flow,. it is applied to blunted wedge where it shows doubling of the drag computed by classic theory, and to cones, where the drag of a blunted cone may become smaller than that of a sharp one.
