the curtain jet. a detailed analytic study is made of the curtain jet, the two-dimensional fluid wall used to contain support pressure on the underside of ground effect machines. two variations of the jet are studied in detail--the bifurcated jet, in which a portion of the flow streams into the support pressure region, and the deflected jet, in which none of the flow penetrates into the support pressure region. kirchhoff-helmholtz free steamline analysis is used to construct the flow field, and quantitative results are presented for the effect of nozzle inclination and detailed geometry on flow requirements and support pressure differential at varying altitudes.
