static aerodynamic characteristics of short blunt cones with various nose and base cone angles at mach numbers of 0. 6 to 5. 5 and angles of attack to 180. wind-tunnel tests have been performed at mach numbers from 0.6 to 5.5 to determine coefficients of normal force, axial force, and pitching moment for short blunt cones, as affected by changes in nose and base cone angles. models with nose half-angles of 10 and 20 were investigated. the 10 nose half-angle models were tested with a flat base and with base cones of 50 and 70 half-angle. the 20 nose half-angle model had a 50 half-angle base cone. reynolds numbers for the test ranged from about maximum diameter. variations in the base cone angle resulted in significant changes in the aerodynamic characteristics, with lesser effects resulting from changes in nose cone angle. in particular, the model with the 50 half-angle conical base had only one trim angle flat base and 70 half-angle conical base had two trim angles (a = 0 and a = 180). estimated variations of the aerodynamic characteristics with angle of attack by means of a modified newtonian theory were in good agreement with the experimental results. the theory, however, failed to predict the trim point at a = 180 for the flat-based model.
