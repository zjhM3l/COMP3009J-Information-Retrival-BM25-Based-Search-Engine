panel flutter tests on full scale x-15 lower vertical stabilizer at mach number of 3. 0. panel flutter tests were conducted on two full-scale vertical stabilizers of the x-15 airplane at a mach number of 3.0 in the langley at dynamic pressures from 1,500 psf to 5,000 psf and stagnation temperatures from 300 f to 660 f. flutter boundaries were obtained for four of the five distinct types of panels which make up the vertical sides of the stabilizers. the boundaries consisted of a flat-panel boundary and a thermally buckled-panel boundary. the flat-panel boundaries were characterized by a reduction in dynamic pressure with increasing skin temperature,. whereas, after thermal buckling the trend was reversed. the minimum dynamic pressure for flutter occurred at the intersection of the flat-panel and buckled-panel boundaries and represented a large reduction in the dynamic pressure over the extrapolated, unstressed value. as a result of panel flutter, three of the five distinct types of panels were modified to provide the required flutter margin on the design flight dynamic pressure of the aircraft.
