heat transfer and pressure distributions on a hemisphere-cylinder and a bluff-afterbody model in methane-air combustion products and in air. an experimental investigation has been made to indicate the validity of using methane-air combustion products as the test medium for aerodynamic heating and loading tests. tests were conducted on a hemisphere-cylinder and on a bluff-afterbody model, both in methane-air combustion products and in air alone, and covered a range of mach numbers from 6 to the data showed that the nondimensional heating-rate distribution along a hemisphere-cylinder as obtained in combustion products was in good agreement with that obtained in air, and the results were in reasonable agreement with theory. the stagnation-point heating rates in air and in combustion products over the hemisphere-cylinder agreed within 10 percent of the theoretical values. the pressure distributions around a hemisphere-cylinder obtained from tests in combution products were in good agreement with those obtained in air and could be predicted by newtonian flow theory. the tests in combustion products of a bluff-afterbody model produced nondimensional heat-transfer coefficients which were in fair agreement with results obtained in air.
