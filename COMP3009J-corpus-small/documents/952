study of creep collapse of a long circular cylindrical shell under various distributed force systems. an analysis is presented for determining the collapse of circular rings and long cylinders subjected to primary and secondary creep conditions at elevated temperatures. the types of loading considered for the present investigation are dead loading and hydrostatic pressure-type forces. the method of solution is based on an application of the variational theorem for creep described in ref. 1 with some additional terms being introduced for the pressure-type loading case. the general results are reduced to a relatively simple form for the theoretical predictions of collapse time and are graphically illustrated for a typical sample material.
