a simple model study of transient temperature and thermal stress distribution due to aerodynamic heating. the present work is concerned with the determination of transient temperatures and thermal stresses in simple models intended to simulate parts or the whole of an aircraft structure of the built- up variety subjected to aerodynamic heating. the first case considered is that of convective heat transfer into one side of a flat plate, representing a thick skin, and the effect of the resulting temperature distribution in inducing thermal stresses associated with bending restraint at the plate edges. numerical results are presented for the transient temperature differentials in the plate when the environment temperature first increases linearly with time and then remains constant, the period of linear increase representing the time of acceleration of the aircraft. corresponding thermal stress information is presented. the second case is that of the wide-flanged i-beam with convective heat transfer into the outer faces of the flanges. numerical results are presented for transient temperature differentials for a wide range of values of the applicable parameters and for an environment temperature variation as described above. corresponding thermal stresses in a beam of infinite length are determined. a theoretical analysis of the stress distribution in a beam of finite length is carried out and numerical results obtained for one case. an experimental investigation of temperatures and stresses in such a beam is described, and results are presented which indicate good agreement with corresponding theoretical results.
