fluctuating lift and drag acting on a cylinder in a flow at supercritical reynolds numbers. the fluctuating lift and drag acting on a circular cylinder in a flow of an incompressible fluid at large reynolds numbers were measured. data on the root-mean-square values of the lift and drag coefficients, the extreme values of these coefficients, and their power spectra at various reynolds numbers are presented.
