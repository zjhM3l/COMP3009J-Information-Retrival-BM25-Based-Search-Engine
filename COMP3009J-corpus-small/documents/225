elliptic cones alone and with wings at supersonic speeds. to help fill the gap in the knowledge of aerodynamics of shapes intermediate between bodies of revolution and flat triangular wings, force and moment characteristics for elliptic cones have been experimentally determined for mach numbers of 1.97 and sectional axis ratios from 1 through 6 and with lengths and base areas equal to circular cones of fineness ratios 3.67 and 5 have been studied for angles of bank of 0 and 90. elliptic and circular cones in combination with triangular wings of aspect ratios 1 and 1.5 also have been considered. the angle-of-attack range was from 0 to about 16, and the reynolds number was 8x10, based on model length. in addition to the forces and moments at angle of attack, pressure distributions for elliptic cones at zero angle of attack have been determined. the results of this investigation indicate that there are distinct aerodynamic advantages to the use of elliptic cones. with their major cross-sectional axes horizontal, they develop greater lift and have higher lift-drag ratios than circular cones of the same fineness ratio and volume. in combination with triangular wings of low aspect ratio, they also develop higher lift-drag ratios than circular cones with the same wings. for winged elliptic cones, this increase in lift-drag ratio results both from lower zero-lift drag and drag due to lift. visual-flow studies indicate that, because of better streamlining in the crossflow plane, vortex flow is inhibited more for an elliptic cone with major axis in the plane of the wing than for a circular cone with the same wing. as a result, vortex drag resulting from lift is reduced. shifts in center of pressure with changes in angle of attack and mach number are small and about the same as for circular cones. comparisons of theoretical and experimental force and moment characteristics for elliptic cones indicate that simple linearized (flat plate) wing theory is generally adequate even for relatively thick cones. zero-lift pressure distributions and drag can be computed using van dyke's second-order slender-body theory. for winged circular cones, a modification of the slender-body theory of naca rep. 962 results in good agreement of theory with experiment.
