progress report on an experiment on the effect of surface flexibility on the stability of laminar flow. this paper describes the flexible surfaces whose properties have been examined and which have been tested on an aerofoil in a wind tunnel. the experiment has been rather inconclusive as no drag reductions have been found in turbulent flow, whilst the only rearward movements of transition occurred in conditions where the alteration has been inhibited by the onset of laminar separation. the limitations of the experiment are discussed carefully in order to clarify the next steps which are to be taken with more flexible surfaces with less damping.
