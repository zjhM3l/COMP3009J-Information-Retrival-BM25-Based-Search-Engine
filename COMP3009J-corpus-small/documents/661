summary of laminar boundary layer solutions for wedge-type flow over convection and transpiration cooled surfaces. a summary of exact solutions of the laminar-boundary-layer equations for wedge-type flow, useful in estimating heat transfer to such arbitrarily shaped bodies as turbine blades, is presented. the solutions are determined for small mach numbers and a prandtl number at the wall of 0.7 ,. ranges of mainstream pressure gradients and rates of coolant flow through a porous wall are considered for the following cases.. (1) small temperature changes in the boundary layer along a constant- and along a variable-temperature wall, and (2) large temperature changes in the boundary layer along a constant-temperature wall. dimensionless forms of heat-transfer and friction parameters and boundary-layer thicknesses are tabulated. the results indicate that coolant emission and increased stream-to-wall temperature ratios diminished the friction and heat transfer for a constant wall temperature. for a variable wall temperature with small temperature differences in the boundary layer, the friction was unaffected, but the heat transfer was greatly increased for increased wall-temperature gradient. heat-transfer results in the literature reveal that transpiration cooling is much more effective for prandtl numbers of the order of 5.0 than for 0.7.
