a rapid approximate method for determining velocity distribution on impeller blades of centrifugal compressors. a rapid approximate method of analysis was developed for both compressible and incompressible, nonviscous flow through radial- or mixed-flow centrifugal compressors with arbitrary hub and shroud contours and with arbitrary blade shape. the method of analysis is used to determine approximately the velocities everywhere along the blade surfaces, but no information concerning the variation in velocity across the passage between blades is given. in eight numerical examples for two-dimensional flow, covering a fairly wide range of flow rate, impeller-tip speed, number of blades, and blade curvature, the velocity distribution along the blade surfaces was obtained by the approximate method of analysis and compared with the velocities obtained by relaxation methods. in all cases the agreement between the approximate solutions and the relaxation solutions was satisfactory except at the impeller tip where the velocities obtained by the approximate method did not, in general, become equal on both surfaces of the blade as required by the joukowski condition.
