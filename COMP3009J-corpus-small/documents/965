analytic determination of discharge coefficients of flow nozzles. integration of the velocity profile at the throat of a flow nozzle yields the discharge coefficient as a function of the ratio of boundary solution of the approximate momentum equation for the boundary layer. the resulting expression for the discharge coefficient is then a function of the reynolds number based on nozzle diameter and of the geometry of the nozzle. good agreement is shown between this expression and published experimental data on flow nozzles for reynolds numbers between
