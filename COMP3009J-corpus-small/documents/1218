experimental lift and drag of a series of glide configurations at mach numbers 12.6 and 17.5. a series of semiballistic-type bodies consisting of three half sphere cones of 0.3 bluntness ratio with half-cone angles of 8.6, laboratory hypersonic shock tunnel at m = 17.5 and 12.4. in addition, a representative winged glide configuration consisting of a sharp-edged, 60 swept delta wing with cone-segment the range of angle of attack for the half sphere-cone tests was the technique for force coefficient determination consists of analyzing high-speed motion pictures of the motion of very light balsa and isofoam plastic models which are literally free-flown for several milliseconds in the test section of the shock tunnel. because of viscous effects the newtonian prediction of half sphere cone drag is consistently less than, but generally parallel these bodies is generally well predicted by the newtonian theory except at small and moderate positive angles of attack where it is generally less than newtonian. this lift deficiency appears to increase with cone half angle. maximum lift-drag ratios fall considerably short of the newtonian predictions. several exploratory tests at mach 11.7 and low reynolds number ( approximately reduction in) on the 13 model produced an approximate doubling of minimum drag and a 35 percent decrease in (l d) max,. this demonstrates the importance of viscous effects for blunt bodies in the reynolds number range of these tests. the sharp leading-edge, 60 sweep delta wing-body configuration exhibited the same (l d) max, as the wing alone, about 2.80 at both positive and negative angles of attack.
