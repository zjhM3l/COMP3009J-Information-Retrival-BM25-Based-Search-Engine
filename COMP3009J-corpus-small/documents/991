wing-flow study of pressure drag reduction at transonic speed by projecting a jet of air from the nose of a prolate spheroid of fineness ratio 6. a study was made at transonic speeds by the naca wing-flow method of the pressure-drag reduction obtained by projecting a high-energy jet of air from the nose of a prolate spheroid. supplementary information was obtained by taking shadowgraphs of the model mounted in a small supersonic tunnel at a constant mach number of 1.5. the high-velocity jet was observed to alter the pressure distribution over the body in such a way that the pressure drag of the body was reduced,. thus, in a restricted sense, the nose jet produced a thrust on the body. under the conditions investigated, the thrust produced by the nose jet was never so large as that which would be expected from a conventional rearward jet. for example, under the best conditions tested /mach number of 1.07/ the reduction in body pressure drag caused by the nose jet more than compensated for the negative thrust of the jet itself. however, the magnitude of the net reduction in drag /change in body pressure drag with jet on and jet off minus the adverse thrust of the jet/ was only about one-half of the thrust which would be produced by the same jet exhausting rearward. the appearance of such an unexpectedly large effect in the first trial indicated the phenomenon to be worth further study.
