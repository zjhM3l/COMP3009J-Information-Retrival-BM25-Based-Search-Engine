on som reciprocal relations in the theory of nonstationary flows. in the theory of nonstationary flows about airfoils, the /indicial lift/ function k /s/ of wagner and the /alternating lift/ function c /k/ of theodorsen have fundamental significance. this paper reports on some interesting relations of the nature of fourier transforms that exist between these functions. general problems in transient flows about airfoils may be given a unified broad treatment when these functions are employed. certain approximate results also are reported which are of notable simplicity, and an analogy with transient electrical flows is drawn.
