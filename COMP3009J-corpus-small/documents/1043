on transverse vibrations of thin, shallow elastic shells. a numerical analysis is given for the solution of the general equations of thin shells of revolution subjected to rotationally symmetric pressure and temperature distributions. the basic differential equations are in a very general form, which permits the geometry of the shells considered, to be specified by discrete data points. the analysis determines elastic stresses, strains and displacements for multi-layer and multi-sectional shells of revolution. surface loads, temperatures, thicknesses and material properties may vary arbitrarily in the meridional direction. temperatures and material properties can also vary through the thickness. the solution is obtained by direct computation using a numerical method that employs two by two coefficient matrices,. and hence avoids the problems of slow convergence. the solution has been programmed in a semi-algebraic language which can be used on most high speed computers. comparisons of numerical solutions to known exact and approximate solutions of the thin shell equations are made to demonstrate the accuracy of this method.
