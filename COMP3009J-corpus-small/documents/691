calculation procedure for thermodynamic transport, and flow properties of the combustion products of a hydrocarbon fuel mixture burned in air with results for ethylene-air and methane-air mixtures. a procedure is presented whereby the composition, thermodynamic properties, and transport properties of the dissociated combustion products of a fuel consisting of a mixed hydrocarbon compound burned in air may be calculated. equations and procedures for determining supersonic nozzle ordinates and flow properties for the dissociated combustion products are presented in an appendix. results are presented for the respective hydrocarbon fuels, methane and ethylene, at the equivalence ratios of 1.0, 0.9, 0.8, and 0.7 for pressures varying between 10 and 8 x 10 atmospheres and temperatures from 200degree k to
