on transverse vibrations of thin, shallow elastic shells. experimental measurements of pressures and heat-transfer rates over three blunt afterbodies of small fineness ratio in fully separated wakes are presented. the afterbodies are generally similar in shape but have different stepdown heights from the end of the forebody. tests were made by means of a new shroud technique over a range of reynolds numbers closely corresponding to typical flight conditions at mach numbers on the order of 20, considering models on the order of 5 ft. in diameter at about 120,000 ft. altitude. stagnation temperatures on the order of 1,300 r. to strictly speaking, the test flows correspond to prototype flows which would be created by a forebody consisting of a sharp or slightly blunted 54 half angle cone which turns cylindrical for a short distance and then connects with the afterbody. judiciously interpreted, the results may be considered to have a somewhat wider applicability for approximation purposes. the results are presented and compared with each other in terms of nondimensional variables based on flow conditions at the end of the forebody. the pressure distribution along an afterbody is seen to be roughly uniform in each run. for a given point on an afterbody, the ratio of pressure to the stagnation pressure at the forebody end (or exit) decreases with increasing stagnation pressure or reynolds number. the present pressures and pressure-reynolds number variations (fig. 8) are compared with values obtained from chapman's mach 2 or 3 base-pressure data,. qualitative and some quantitative agreement is noted. in the reynolds number range comparable to those of the present tests, chapman's exit boundary layers were considered to be laminar. an approximate check of the heat-transfer rate at the forebody end in the present tests also indicates a laminar rate. no information was obtained concerning the possible transition of the free-mixing separated boundary layer covering the wake. an adverse pressure gradient on the cylindrical end of the forebody figs. 7(a) and 7(c) was observed. heat-transfer rates are seen to be roughly uniform over an afterbody in each run, although some increase in the streamwise direction is noted. the afterbody nusselt number (n) varies with the reynolds number (r evaluated at the forebody end) roughly in the manner n r where generally (fig. 13). heat rates on the rear faces of the afterbodies are almost twice the values on the sides. the heat rates on the large-step body are higher than those on the body of zero stepdown height. in an addendum, it is shown that the prandtl-meyer expansion angle of the flow leaving the afterbody increases with increasing test reynolds number, and that the corresponding local mach number square increases linearly with reynolds number. the effect is to keep the local wake reynolds numbers virtually constant with increasing test reynolds number while the afterbody heat rates increase sharply. the expansion angle on the afterbody of zero stepdown height is significantly smaller than on the stepped down bodies,. this may affect the decreased heat rates on this body.
