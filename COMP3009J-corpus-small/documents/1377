theoretical investigation of the flow field about blunt nosed bodies in supersonic flight. a numerical method ofr obtaining the solution to the inverse problem of the flow behind a given detached shock to any desired accuracy is presented. the cases of zero and small incidence are considered. the combination of sets of such solutions satisfying prescribed boundary conditions (body shapes) is described. particular attention is devoted to the analysis of the sonic and subsonic region of the flow field. convergence and stability of the stepwise integration from the shock in the elliptic region are discussed. numerical examples are also included.
