remarks on donnell's equations. flugge's set of differential equations of equilibrium for circular cylindrical shells is expressed in a form analogous to the donnell equations. the results of solutions of the two sets of equations for a simply supported cylinder under a centrally applied, uniformly distributed radial line load over a generator segment, as well as under sinusoidally applied line loads, are in very good agreement for the particular geometry investigated.
