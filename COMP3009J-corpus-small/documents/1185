an integral method for calculating heat and mass transfer in laminar boundary layers. an integral method previously used successfully in several kinds of boundary layer problems has been extended to treat simultaneous heat and mass transfer in a binary-mixture laminar boundary layer when the pressure is uniform. the principal results are two pairs of dual integral relations arising from solutions to the integral concentration and energy equations. one pair connects the surface mass transfer rate and surface concentration of injected gas,. the other relates surface temperature and heat transfer rate in the presence of mass transfer. only the cases of helium and air injection into an undissociated air stream are discussed in detail, but the method can be applied to problems involving other gases. the approximate results agree quite well with some numerical solutions and with recent experimental results for which no numerical solutions are available.
