simplified laminar boundary layer calculations for bodies of revolution and for yawed wings. since the introduction of momentum methods in boundary-layer calculations by von karman and pohlhausen, many improvements have been proposed. an especially simple solution reduces the problem to a quadrature. here, it is proposed to extend these methods to elementary three-dimensional cases and to compressible laminar boundary-layer calculations. for comparison, the corresponding problems for the turbulent boundary layer are also discussed briefly.
