heat transfer in turbulent shear flow. the problems of heat transfer in turbulent shear flow along a smooth wall are discussed from the point of view of von karman's well-known 1939 paper on the analogy between fluid friction and heat transfer. methods for extending the analysis to higher prandtl numbers are suggested.
