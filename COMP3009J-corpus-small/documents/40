experiments on boundary layer transition at supersonic speeds. tests were conducted in the 12-in. continuous supersonic wind tunnel of the jet propulsion laboratory, california institute of technology, to determine the effects of surface cooling on boundary-layer transition at supersonic speeds. the effects of cooling were investigated at test section mach numbers of 1.97, smooth cone in the presence of three levels of supply-stream turbulence (0.4, 2, and 9 per cent) and several single-element roughnesses at fixed axial location. transition data were obtained optically by means of a magnified-schlieren system. the results, for the range of mach number investigated, indicate that (1) transition on a smooth cone can definitely be delayed by surface cooling, (2) transition promoted by either supply-stream turbulence or surface roughness can also be delayed by surface cooling depending upon degree of turbulence or relative roughness respectively, and (3) the adverse effects of increased turbulence and roughness decrease with increasing mach number.
