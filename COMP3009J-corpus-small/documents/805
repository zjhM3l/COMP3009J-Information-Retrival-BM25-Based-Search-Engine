ground measurements of the shock wave noise from airplanes in level flight at mach numbers to 1. 4 and at altitudes to 45,000 feet. time histories of noise pressures near ground level were measured during flight tests of fighter-type airplanes over fairly flat, partly wooded terrain in the mach number range between 1.13 and 1.4 and at altitudes from 25,000 to 45,000 feet. atmospheric soundings and radar-tracking studies were made for correlation with the measured noise data. the measured and calculated values of the pressure rise across the shock wave were generally in good agreement. there is a tendency for the theory to overestimate the pressure at locations remote from the track and to underestimate the pressures for conditions of high tailwind at altitude. the measured values of ground-reflection factor averaged about 1.8 for the surfaces tested as compared to a theoretical value of 2.0. two booms were measured in all cases. the observers also generally reported two booms,. although, in some cases, only one boom was reported. the shock-wave noise associated with some of the flight tests was judged to be objectionable by ground observers, and in one case the cracking of a plate-glass store window was correlated in time with the passage of the airplane at an altitude of 25,000 feet.
