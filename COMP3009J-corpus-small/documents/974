approximate analysis of thrust vector control by fluid injection. a study has been made of the side force generated by injection of secondary material into the main stream of a rocket nozzle. two cases have been analyzed.. gas injection and liquid injection. for the gas injection case, it is assumed that the turbulent boundary layer ahead of the injection point separates from the wall. the pressure in the separated region and the extent of the separated region are determined by a consideration of turbulent boundary layer-shock wave interaction and the accommodation height of the injected gas stream. equations are derived for calculating the side force, and the side forces predicted by the theory are compared with experimental data. the agreement between theory and experiment is fair. for the case of liquid injection, it is assumed that the liquid flows along the nozzle wall and evaporates into the main stream. the resulting side force on the nozzle wall is determined on the basis of linearized theory, thus restricting the analysis to small rates of liquid injection. the effects of small rates of heat addition are also included in the analysis. a very simple equation for calculating the side force is obtained.
