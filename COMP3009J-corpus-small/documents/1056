axisymmetric large deflections of circular plates subjected to thermal and mechanical load. this paper is concerned with the nonlinear axisymmetric analysis of circular plates with in-plane edge restraint. both temperature and mechanical loads are accommodated as an extension of investigations performed for the isothermal mechanical loading problem. an exact mathematical formulation within the framework of the v. karman large strain-displacement relations is developed. the equilibrium equations and boundary conditions are then derived by utilizing the calculus of variations for arbitrary axisymmetrical temperatures and normal distributed loading. the satisfaction of equilibrium and compatibility equations requires the solution of two simultaneous nonlinear ordinary differential equations subject to the prescribed boundary conditions. analytical solutions of such equations are apparently not possible and therefore numerical procedures must be employed. a finite difference procedure utilizing /relaxed iterations,/ developed by h. keller and e. reiss, and employed by them for the solution of isothermal problems with apparently unlimited load parameter ranges, is used here for combined thermo-mechanical problems. numerical results are presented for the special case of a simply supported circular plate with radially immovable boundaries, subject to a uniform pressure and an arbitrary temperature variation through the thickness tained for a large range of temperature and load parameters. however, because of space limitations, only a limited amount of data are presented in this paper.
