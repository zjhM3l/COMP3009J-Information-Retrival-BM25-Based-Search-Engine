some notes for the small disturbance linear theory of the method of local linearisation of the flow over an airfoil at mach number of unity. in this paper, the pressure distribution at the surface of a symmetrical non-lifting aerofoil with free stream mach number of unity has been investigated by means of the small-disturbance linear theory or the method of local linearization. and by comparing with the calculated results based on an hodograph method, the accuracy of these approximate methods has been evaluated. moreover, when these approximate methods are used for the calculation of the pressure coefficient, some notes necessary to obtain more correct results have been discussed.
