plasma flow over a thin charged conductor. the flow of a dense plasma over a wavy conducting wall of small amplitude is investigated where magnetic effects are negligible. these results are then used to analyze the flow over a thin conductor with cusped edges. it is found that the coulomb drag vanishes identically, while the fluid-pressure drag corresponds to the ackeret value for a neutral particle gas at the reduced-plasma mach number.
