the flow of fluid along cylinders. the boundary layer equations for uniform flow parallel to the generators of any cylinder without corners are put into the form of a series of linear third-order differential equations. the first three of these are the same as those obtained by seban and bond /1/ for a circular cylinder and solved by kelly /2/. the rest have additional terms depending on the radius of curvature of the cylinder and its derivatives. the problem is also attacked by a pohlhausen method as far as four terms of the series. for large distances from the front, rayleigh's method, as given by hasimoto /3/, gives the first two terms of an asymptotic expansion for the drag. explicit calculations are made of the drag of an elliptic cylinder of eccentricity 1/2 3. there is evidence that the drag is everywhere less than that of a circular cylinder of the same perimeter.
