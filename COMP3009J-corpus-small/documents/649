the hovercraft - a new concept in maritime transport. the hovercraft is the first operational british project in the ground-effect machine field. although there has, for a number of years, been a tentative searching after the principles underlying such machines, it is only now that their possibilities as commercial transport and service craft are beginning to be developed. since the hovercraft is a new vehicle, the appearance of the saunders-roe sr-n1, a manned experimental craft, excited considerable public attention and there have been a number of descriptive articles in the press. papers of a more technical type, on ground-effect machines, are now beginning to appear and it is to be expected that these will rapidly increase in number, especially since american interest in both the commercial and defence fields is expanding fast. the authors of the present paper have, therefore, concentrated attention upon features about which they had something personal to say, and which they consider to be of particular significance for assessing the possibility of the hovercraft becoming important in maritime transport. these features are..- the hovercraft as a fundamentally new principle in the transport field. the powering requirements and resistance characteristics. the likely operating costs of hovercraft in comparison with other forms of maritime transport. in addition, relatively brief descriptions of the history and the current work being undertaken on the ground-effect machine and of the design, construction, and testing of the saunders-roe sr-n1 are provided. the final section discusses outstanding problems and some future possibilities.
