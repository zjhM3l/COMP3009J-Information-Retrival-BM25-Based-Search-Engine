on the hypersonic viscous flow past slender bodies of revolution. a similar solution of the hypersonic viscous flow past slender bodies of revolution is deduced for a special case when the radial coordinate of the body surface at section x is proportional to x, where the radial coordinate have the comparable order value with the thickness of the boundary layer. here, /similar/ is used in the direct meaning that distributions in the boundary layer keep the similar form lengthwise. calculations are accomplished for the region of strong interaction between the boundary layer and the shock wave. from several calculations it may be expected that if the thickness of the body becomes small, the thickness of the layer in which the longitudinal velocity component u is rapidly decreased also becomes small, and in the major part of the boundary layer, only the normal component v is increased. further if the thickness of the body is increased, then, the height of the shock wave, the pressure on the wall, and the shear stress at the wall are also increased while the boundary layer thickness is decreased. the nose region is excluded by the reason that the ordinary boundary layer theory will be invalid there.
