pressure measurements on sharp and blunt 5 and 15 half-angle cones at mach number 3.86 and angles of attack to 100. measured pressure distributions on cones are compared with modified newtonian theory. deviations as large as 14 percent of the stagnation pressure behind a normal shock are found. by combining empirical results for cylinders normal to the flow with newtonian concepts, a method of calculating pressures on cones at high angles of attack is developed. calculations by this method differ from the experimental results on sharp cones by only 2 percent of the stagnation pressure behind a normal shock. for blunted cones, additional deviations up to 8 percent are noted near the nose. schlieren pictures of the flow show an attached shock on the sharp of attack. detachment of the shock appears to be associated with the attainment of sonic speed immediately behind the shock. an orifice size effect is found which can increase the indicated pressure above the true value, if the orifice width is greater than one-tenth the local radius of curvature.
