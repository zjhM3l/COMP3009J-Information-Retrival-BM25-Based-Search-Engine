variational analysis of ablation. the variational and lagrangian thermodynamics developed in earlier publications are directly applicable to problems of heat conduction with melting boundaries. these techniques are used here in treating the problem of a half-space subjected to a constant rate of heat input at the melting surface (fig. 1). the applicability of the lagrangian equations to this case follows from the fact that the basic variational principle is valid whether the boundaries are fixed or move as arbitrary functions of time. this can be seen if we remember that the equations govern only the instantaneous configuration of the flow rates for a given geometry and temperature field.
