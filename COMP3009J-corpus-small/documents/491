on the close relationship between turbulent plane-couette and pressure flows. author studies the velocity profiles measured by others in plane and turbulent couette flow, such as is induced in parallel channels of which one of the walls moves in its own plane. he finds these profiles to be satisfactorily describable in terms of the seventh-power law, which was originally set up for plane and turbulent pressure flow in channels where both walls are stationary. further, he finds the shear law for pressure flow, to be applicable also to the couette flow, in a similar range of reynolds number, r. no attempt is made in this concise contribution to put these findings on a firmer basis through a theoretical explanation.
