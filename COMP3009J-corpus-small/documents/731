upper and lower bounds for the solution of the first biharmonic boundary value problem. let w(x,y) be a solution of the boundary value problem where r is a plane domain with the boundary c. the authors obtain upper and lower bounds for, the value of w at a point in r, by a method which is applicable to many other problems. if u is a function satisfying the boundary conditions and v is a function satisfying the partial differential equation, then the authors obtain by applying green's classical identity and schwarz's inequality a pair of inequalities of the form where. together with the function w the authors consider a function the solution of the boundary value problem on c, and in analogy with the functions u and v associated with the function w a pair of functions and associated with the function. in the expression for derived from green's classical identity appears an unknown line integral containing the values of w and on c. but the same line integral appears also in the expressions for to which the above inequalities are applicable. in this way the authors obtain two inequalities of the form where b and b', respectively, are approximate values of. in order to improve these bounds one may add to u a linear set of functions and to v a linear set of functions and then minimize h(u-v) in order to determine the coefficients of the best linear combinations. if the sequences and are complete in a certain sense defined by the authors the approximations will converge to the value.
