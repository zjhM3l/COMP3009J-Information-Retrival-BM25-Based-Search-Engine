investigaion of the flow over a spiked-nose hemisphere cylinder at a mach number of 6. 8. the shape and nature of the flow over a spiked-nose hemisphere-cylinder was studied in detail at a nominal mach number of 6.8 and in a reynolds number range (based on diameter and stream conditions ahead of the model) of 0.12 x 10 to 1.5 x 10. schlieren photographs showed the effect of varying the spike length and reynolds number upon the shape of the separated boundary and upon the location of transition. the heat transfer and pressure distribution over the body were then correlated with the location of the start of separation, the location of reattachment, and the location of the start of transition.
