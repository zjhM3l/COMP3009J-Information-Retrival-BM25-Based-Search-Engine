note on creep buckling of columns. a method for estimating allowable load capacities of columns subject to creep is presented. the method, which utilizes approximate stress distributions derived from isochronous-stress-strain curves to estimate column load capacities, is shown to be conservative for the time for which the estimate is made. an application of the method is made to test data on as-received and on stabilized 24s-t4 aluminum alloy. a comparison of the computed column capacities with experimental capacities indicates that the method is satisfactory for estimating the decrease in capacity with increasing time. easily obtained, time-dependent tangent-modulus loads are discussed. they are interpreted as being approximations to allowable load-capacity estimates. a limited application is made to test data, and the results appear promising. it is concluded that if certain limitations are recognized, the method may prove to be useful because of its simplicity. a presentation of the results of an experimental investigation of the effects of column imperfection and column-material variation is made. it is found that column-capacity variations of the order of 10 per cent can result from column-imperfection differences and column-material variation. the results of an experimental study of the variation of column capacity with temperature of exposure are presented. they indicate that column efficiency, as measured by decrease in capacity, can be acceptable for very short times at the higher temperatures. the efficiency at these higher temperatures falls rapidly, however, with increasing time.
