static aerodynamic characteristics of a short blunt 10 semi-vertex angle cone at a mach number of 15 in helium. axial force, normal force, pitching moment, and shock-wave shape were determined for a body of revolution consisting of a short blunt 10 semivertex angle cone with a flat base and also with a conical afterbody having a semi-vertex angle of 50. measurements were made in helium at a free-stream mach number of 15 and a free-stream reynolds number of 2.25x10 based on maximum body diameter over an angle-of-attack range from the configuration with the conical afterbody was statically stable in the nose-forward attitude only, whereas the configuration with no afterbody was statically stable in both the nose-forward and base-forward attitudes. the force and moment data of both shapes were predicted reasonably well by modified newtonian theory at all angles of attack, except the pitching-moment coefficient for the model without afterbody near 180 angle of attack. in this region, measurements indicated static stability, whereas theory indicated static instability. the helium data agreed reasonably well with a limited amount of force and moment data obtained in a ballistic range at small angles of attack in air at a mach number of 15 and also with force and moment data obtained in air over a complete angle-of-attack range at a mach number of 5.5. the value of axial-force coefficient and the shape of the bow shock wave at zero angle of attack for both models obtained from a numerical flow field calculation agreed very well with the data. the value of the axial force coefficient at 180 angle of attack for the model with afterbody agreed reasonably well with the theoretical value for a cone. the position and shape of the shock envelope near the stagnation point also could be predicted accurately by an approximate method over an angle-of-attack range from
