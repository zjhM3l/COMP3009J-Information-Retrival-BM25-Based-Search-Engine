further developments of new methods in heat flow analysis. lagrangian methods in heat-flow problems and transport phenomena were introduced by the writer in some previous work. the present paper develops further one particular aspect of the method,--i.e., the elimination of /ignorable coordinates./ this is accomplished by a special choice of generalized coordinates, each of which is constituted by an arbitrary temperature distribution and an /associated flow field./ the latter is a vector field which is derived from the corresponding scalar field by a variational method. the procedure is valid for a certain class of nonlinear problems, provided we replace the temperature by the heat content as the unknown. it is shown that for normal coordinates derivation of the associated flow field is immediate. the use of normal coordinates and their associated flow fields is illustrated by an example. introduction of dirac functions and associated flow fields yields a procedure which constitutes a generalization of the classical formulation by green's functions and integral equations. this is illustrated by application to one-dimensional problems of heating of a homogeneous or composite slab and directly verified by classical methods in the appendix.
