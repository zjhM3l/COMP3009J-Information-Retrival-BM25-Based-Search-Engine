investigation at supersonic speeds of the effects of jet mach number and divergence angle of the nozzle upon the pressure of the base annulus of a body of revolution. an investigation has been conducted in the langley 9-inch supersonic tunnel to determine the jet effects for varying jet mach number and nozzle divergence angle upon the pressure on the base annulus of a model with a cylindrical afterbody. the tests were conducted over a wide range of jet static pressure ratios and at a reynolds number of approximately free-stream mach numbers of 1.62, 1.94, and 2.41. all testing was conducted with an artificially induced turbulent boundary layer along the model. in the lower range of jet static pressure ratios, jet flow from a sonic or supersonic nozzle affected the pressure acting on the base annulus in essentially the same manner as shown in naca rm e53h25 which covers jet static pressure ratios up to about present results showed that the base pressure tends to level off with increasing jet static pressure ratio, and at the extreme static pressure ratios reached in tests with sonic nozzles the base pressure began to decrease. except in the lower range of jet static pressure ratios, nozzle divergence angle generally had a larger effect on the base pressures than nozzle mach number,. the increase in base pressure for a change in divergence angle from 0 to 10 was small compared to the increase when the divergence angle was changed from and other data indicates that the effects of divergence angle were reduced when the ratio of jet exit diameter to base diameter was decreased. jet mach number effects increased with increase in stream mach number.
