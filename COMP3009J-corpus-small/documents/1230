hypersonic nozzle expansion of air with atom recombination present. an experimental investigation on the expansion of high- temperature, high-pressure air to hypersonic flow mach numbers in a conical nozzle of a hypersonic shock tunnel has been carried out. the equilibrium temperature and pressure ranges after the reflected shock wave were 1400 to 6000 k and 100 to 1000 psia. static-pressure measurements, which are sensitive to the state of the gas, were made along the axis of the nozzle for different reservoir conditions. these results are compared with the calculated equilibrium and /frozen/ data for the same geometry and initial reservoir conditions. for reservoir pressures greater than 500 psia, the expansion of the air in the nozzle is essentially in equilibrium up to reservoir temperatures of about 4,500 k. for temperatures greater than almost frozen. at a given area ratio for the nozzle and reservoir pressure, the expansion process remains in equilibrium up to a certain reservoir temperature, and beyond this temperature the flow expansion deviates rapidly from the equilibrium process and approaches the frozen case.
