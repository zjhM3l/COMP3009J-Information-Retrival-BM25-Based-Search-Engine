effect of variable heat recombination on stagnation point heat transfer. earlier studies assume an average heat of formation of atoms based upon external flow conditions. it is shown that equilibrium heat transfer decreases by 35 for a typical mach number 24 case when allowance is made for the proportions of air components. the variable recombination energy also results in atom mass fractions which are realistically less for equilibrium than frozen situations throughout the cold-wall boundary layer.
