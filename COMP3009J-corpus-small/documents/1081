numerical solution of the navier-stokes equations for the flow around a circular cylinder at reynolds number 40. the steady two-dimensional flow around a circular cylinder submerged in a viscous fluid for the case r 40 is investigated, integrating numerically the exact navier-stokes equations. the main results are as follows. /i/ the steady flow solution exists even for the reynolds number as high as 40. moreover, it seems that the solution goes over smoothly to the solution of the kirchhoff discontinuous flow theory which seems to be the limiting flow for the case r. /ii/ the flow pattern and the coefficients of pressure and drag are in good agreement with the experimental data.
