tip-bluntness effects on cone pressures at m=6.85. there is, at present, considerable interest in the characteristies of blunted bodies from both an aerodynamic and a heat-transfer standpoint. the use of blunt shapes is contemplated to reduce the heat-transfer problem at body noses, but there are also applications for blunt noses which occur from mainly aerodynamic considerations. an actual reduction in drag may be the beneficial result of blunting the nose of a cone or a similar slender shape under certain conditions. although the sphere has received considerable treatment, the nose shapes are not necessarily tangent spheres. in the case, let us say, of a total head tube situated in the nose of a given body, the blunting may be quite flat, and nose sections blunter than spherical shape may conceivably be desirable, in some cases, from the heat- transfer standpoint. the purpose of the present investigation is to examine the aerodynamic effect of a simple type of nose blunting on a basic body. the incompressible flow of an electrically conducting fluid past a porous plate y = 0 with constant suction velocity in the presence of a transverse uniform strength has recently been investigated by gupta. in this note, the problem is generalized to take into account the effect of free convection, when a body force g per unit mass is acting in the negative x-direction parallel to the wall. the fluid is assumed to be semi- incompressible as usual. in addition to the obvious practical significance, this problem is also interesting in the sense that it provides another exact solution of the magnetohydrodynamic equations, since the only electromagnetic assumptions involved are constant properties and freedom from excessive charges.
