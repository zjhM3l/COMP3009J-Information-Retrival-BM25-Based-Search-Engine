oscillatory aerodynamic coefficients for a unified supersonic hypersonic strip theory. this investigation presents a derivation of the oscillatory aerodynamic coefficients for wings with supersonic leading edges from the second-order, nonlinear, unsteady, supersonic flow theory of van dyke. the theory is considered applicable throughout the supersonic-hypersonic regime at mach numbers normal to the leading edge and reduced frequencies for which. the coefficients are modified for sweep, and a finite-span correction is suggested to increase the accuracy of strip-theory flutter analyses. the limiting values of the coefficients in steady flow are also discussed.
