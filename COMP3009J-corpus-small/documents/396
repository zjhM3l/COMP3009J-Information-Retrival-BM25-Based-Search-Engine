variational and lagrangian thermodynamics of thermal convection-fundamental shortcomings of the heat transfer coefficient. extension of previous analyses, indicating the possibility of extending the thermodynamics of irreversible processes to systems which are not in the vicinity of an equilibrium state and for which onsager's relations are not verified. this involves generalizations beyond the narrow field of heat transfer and to principles of wider range than those of current nonequilibrium thermodynamics.
