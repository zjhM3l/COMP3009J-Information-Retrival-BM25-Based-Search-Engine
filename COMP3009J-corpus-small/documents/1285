experiments at hypersonic speeds on circular cones at incidence. pressure distribution measurements on five circular cones with total apex-angles ranging from 25 to 45 degrees are described. the tests covered a range of angles of incidence from 0 to and 8.60. the extent to which various analytical and empirical theories predict the measured pressures is assessed.
