effect of diffusion fields on the laminar boundary layer. a theory is developed which describes the effect of a general diffusion field on the dynamic and thermal characteristics of a laminar boundary layer on a flat plate in steady compressible flow. fluid properties are considered as functions of temperature and local concentration of the foreign gas. the diffusion field is described by a differential equation that relates convective and diffusion transfer and which considers diffusion currents arising from gradients of concentration and temperature. by means of the usual transformations the system is reduced to a set of ordinary differential equations, which in turn are transformed into a set of integral equations. the latter is amenable to solution by the method of successive approximations. the theory and results have bearing on the problem of control and reduction of aerodynamic heating at hypersonic speeds. the special feature of this approach lies in the utilization of diffusion fields for the purpose of reducing the detrimental effects of viscous dissipation. although the theory is adapted to a fuller investigation of this problem, the numerical examples considered involve mainly diffusion fields of helium, with which good results have been achieved at mach numbers 8 and 12. whereas at the higher mach number the influx of heat was practically eliminated, a reversal in the direction of heat flow has been effected at the lower mach number.
