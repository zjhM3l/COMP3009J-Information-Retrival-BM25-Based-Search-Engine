manoeuvring technique for changing the plane of circular orbits with minimum fuel expenditure. usaf-supported discussion of the use of an intermediate elliptic orbit for changing the plane of a circular orbit. values of the perigee and apogee velocities are calculated for the following cases.. the braking impulse supplied by grazing of the atmosphere,. and (3) re-orbit with 90 of the braking impulse supplied in this manner.
