slender-body theory-review and extension. the approximate theory of flow about slender bodies and wings originated by munk and jones is reviewed. it is presented here in a form that emphasizes the relation to the source-sink methods of von karman and others. the extension to noncircular bodies is made for subsonic flow, paralleling ward's extension for supersonic flow. the calculation of pressures and forces and the extension of the theory to unsteady flows are reviewed, and some discrepancies in the published literature are explained. finally, interpreting the jones slender-wing result as the first term of an expansion in powers of a breadth parameter /e.g., aspect ratio/, it is shown how a more accurate theory can be developed by carrying additional terms for both subsonic and supersonic speeds. this theory of not-so-slender wings is applied to some practical wing problems, including direct problems of flow past given wings and problems of wing design for minimum drag. the accuracy of the new results is assessed by comparison with linearized supersonic-airfoil theory for the special case of a flat delta wing.
