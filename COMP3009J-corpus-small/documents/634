effects of leading edge bluntness on flutter characteristics of some square- planform double-wedge airfoils at a mach number of 15.4. results are presented from a wind-tunnel investigation in helium flow at a mach number of 15.4. the models were square-planform, double-wedge, shaft-mounted airfoils with leading- and trailing-edge radii of 0, 1, 3, and 6 percent chord. in general, the tests indicate that bluntness effects on the model flutter characteristics are stabilizing as the leading-edge radius is increased from 0 to destabilizing with further increase in bluntness. results of flutter calculations made by using newtonian theory aerodynamics and a combination of newtonian theory and piston theory aerodynamics in conjunction with an uncoupled two-mode analysis are compared with experimental results. the piston-theory results accurately predicted flutter speeds for the models with
