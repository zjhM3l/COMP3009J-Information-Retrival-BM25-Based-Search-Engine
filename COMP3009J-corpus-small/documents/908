random vibration. random vibration is vibration which results from an excitation which is not well represented by any simple function (sinusoid, step, etc.) or any simple combination of such functions but which is satisfactorily modeled by a stochastic process. it is perhaps not too much of an exaggeration to say that /all vibration is random vibration./ every vibration record contains /hash/ at some level. nevertheless, until recently, engineering vibration theory has been able to get along without including the consideration of random excitations. now in several fields simultaneously there has occurred a burst of activity in the application of random processes. the response of aircraft to buffeting from atmospheric turbulence and the response of ships to confused seas have been put on reasonably firm footing. possibly the most dramatic problems have been posed by the development of large jet and rocket engines which produce spectacular amounts of random vibrational energy. the high level of random vibration in a jet plane or a missile provides a severe environment with respect to fatigue failure of structural members and with respect to malfunctions of sensitive equipment.
