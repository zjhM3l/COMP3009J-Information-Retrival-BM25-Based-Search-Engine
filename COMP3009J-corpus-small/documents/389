simple shear flow past a flat plate in a compressible viscous fluid. by transformation of variables, the problem of a simple shear flow of a compressible fluid over a flat plate is reduced to the corresponding problem for an incompressible fluid. the prandtl number of the compressible fluid is assumed to be unity and its viscosity to be a linear function of temperature.
