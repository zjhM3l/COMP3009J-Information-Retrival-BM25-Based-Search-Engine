transtability flutter of supersonic aircraft panels. for certain aero-elastic configurations it is possible to ascertain critical flutter conditions from static considerations alone. the idea is simply one of negation.. when the air speed exceeds a certain value statically stable equilibrium - and sometimes equilibrium itself take place. there are times when the dynamics of a situation are complex enough to defy a tractable analysis. the value of being able to indicate a flutter criterion from the simpler statics is clear. we will suppose flutter begins when some critical value of the air speed (or some parameter simply related the to) is exceeded. here we will show that there is a critical value which, when exceeded, precludes static equilibrium. underlying our work is the premise that these two critical values are the same. this assumption begs discussion. we will call the lowest value of our air speed parameter to preclude statically stable equilibrium of the system the transtability value. in some cases, excess of this value will ban all possibility of static equilibrium - stable or not., we will then call it a strong transtability value.
