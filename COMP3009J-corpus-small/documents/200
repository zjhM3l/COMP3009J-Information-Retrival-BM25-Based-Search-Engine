calculation of derivatives for a cropped delta wing with subsonic leading edges oscillating in a supersonic airstream. the lift, pitching moment and full-span constant-chord control hinge-moment are derived for a cropped delta wing describing harmonic plunging and pitching oscillations of small amplitude and low-frequency parameter in a supersonic air stream. it is assumed that (a) the wing has subsonic leading edges, (b) the wing is sufficiently thin and the mach number sufficiently supersonic to permit the use of linearised theory. expressions for the various derivative coefficients are obtained for a particular delta wing of aspect ratio 1.8 and taper ratio these are avaluated and tabulated for mach numbers 1.1, 1.15, 1.2, 1.3, 1.4, 1.5, 1.6 and 1.944.
