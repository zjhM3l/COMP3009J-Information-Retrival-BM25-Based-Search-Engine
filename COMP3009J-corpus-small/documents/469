linearised transonic flow about slender bodies at zero angle of attack. the simple linearized transonic flow theory as originally proposed by oswatitsch and keune(1) and by the present authors (2) is improved by considering and partially correcting its error. in this manner a theory which is easy to apply and which should be valid for a great number of smooth bodies is obtained. this improved theory predicts shock waves in the lower transonic regions. it is applied to a number of significant body and airfoil shapes and its predictions are compared with experiments and results of other theoretical investigations.
