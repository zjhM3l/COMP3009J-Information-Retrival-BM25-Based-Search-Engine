theory of radiation from luminous shock waves in nitrogen. the physical properties behind a normal shock in nitrogen are calculated as a function of time. these include the variation of temperature, composition, ionization, and the intensity of radiation from the n first negative band system. this calculation incorporates a rate equation for the dissociation of nitrogen, the conservation laws, an equation describing vibrational relaxation, and a method of coupling the vibrational relaxation with the dissociation rate. the n radiation is computed assuming excitation of the radiating state by collision with vibrationally excited nitrogen molecules. a particular case is considered for which experimental data are available, and regions sensitive to particular rates are indicated.
