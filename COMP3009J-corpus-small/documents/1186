lift of slender delta wings according to newtonian theory. an approximate system of equations is derived to describe the inviscid flow past a flat slender wing at angle of attack, in the limit and. the aspect ratio is required to approach zero at the same rate as the mach angle in the flow behind the shock wave. only a single parameter appears in the resulting equations, and a similarity law therefore can be written expressing a correction to the newtonian normal-force coefficient. for the delta wing, a correlation of experimental data according to the similarity law is shown, and the first terms of the solution are derived under the assumption that the similarity parameter is small ( vertex angle much smaller than mach angle).
