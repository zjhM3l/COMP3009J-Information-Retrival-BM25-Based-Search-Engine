an investigation of separated flows, part i: the pressure field. the present article describes an investigation of several types of separated regions such as blunt-base wakes and cavities formed in cutouts in the boundaries and ahead of or behind two dimensional steps in supersonic (mach numbers 2 to 4) and subsonic flow. the conditions for the existence, the geometry, and the pressure field are described in this paper. a second article (to be published) will describe investigations of the internal flow and the heat transfer across such separated regions. it is found that there is a maximum (critical) ratio of the length of the separated free-shear layer to the depth of the depression in the boundary beyond which the cavity collapses, leaving mutually independent separated regions at each protrusion. this critical length changes greatly upon laminar-turbulent transition in the oncoming boundary layer,. in either laminar or turbulent flow it is approximately independent of mach and reynolds numbers. a semiempirical correlation predicting the conditions under which the flow will span a depression of arbitrary depth is proposed. detailed pressure distributions along the boundaries of a cavity (in turbulent flow) are presented as a function of the ratio of the cavity length to the critical length, which is found to be the pertinent similarity parameter. for short notches the impact pressure due to the reversal of the inner portion of the shear layer at recompression tends to thicken the shear layer and a type of boundary layer-free stream interaction governs the pressure field. the pressure in the cavity is nearly constant and can be higher than free-stream. in long notches the shear layer bends inward at separation and curves back gradually ahead of the recompression point. the floor-pressure variation is pronounced and the recovery pressure at reattachment is small. the variation of the drag coefficient with mach number reflects the change from one to the other mechanism of recompression. detailed surveys of the mach-number distributions in a blunt-body wake and the mixing region behind its throat, as well as in the shear layer spanning a cutout in a wall, are presented and analyzed. it is found that, in general, the assumptions of the simple supersonic-wake models which rely on a principle of steady flow with mass conservation in the cavity are not adequate for cavities in which there is recompression against a boundary. results showing the influence of the thickness of the initial boundary layer (in the range of 0.3 to 3 times the notch depth) and of the geometry of the notch are also presented.
