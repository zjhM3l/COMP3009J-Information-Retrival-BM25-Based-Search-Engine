the buckling strength of a uniform circular cylinder loaded in axial compression. the theoretical estimation of the buckling strength of a cylinder loaded in axial compression is improved by the use of a more representative deflected form for the buckled cylinder than has previously been used. kempner's buckling strength for dead weight loading is reduced by 18. the presentation of the magnitude and distribution of the constraint system required to maintain the mode is novel and instructive.
