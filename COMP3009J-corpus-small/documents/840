analysis of partly wrinkled membrane. a theory is derived to predict the stresses and deformations of stretched-membrane structural components for loads under which part of the membrane wrinkles. rather than studying in detail the deformations in the wrinkled region, the present theory studies average displacements of the wrinkled material. specific solutions of problems in flat and curved membranes are presented. the results of these solutions show that membrane structures retain much of their stiffness at loads substantially above the load at which wrinkling first occurs.
