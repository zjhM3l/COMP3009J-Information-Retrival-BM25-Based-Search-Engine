second approximation to laminar compressible boundary layer on flat plate in slip flow. the first-order solution for the laminar compressible boundary-layer flow over a flat plate at constant wall temperature is given. the effect of slip at the wall as well as the interaction between the boundary-layer flow and the outer stream flow are taken into consideration. the solution is obtained explicitly in terms of the known zero order, or continuum, solution. no assumptions regarding the prandtl number or viscosity-temperature law need be made. it is found that the first-order solution gives a decrease in heat transfer and, for supersonic flow, an increase in skin friction. for subsonic flow there is no first-order shear effect. the change in heat transfer is due to slip and the change in friction is due to the interaction of the zero- and first-order velocities at the outer edge of the boundary layer.
