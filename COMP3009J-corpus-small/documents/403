magnetohydrodynamic shock waves. an interpretation of the de hoffman-teller shock-wave equations for an infinitely conducting medium is given analogous to the classical interpretation of the ordinary hydrodynamic shock-wave equations of rankine and hugoniot. two cases of interest are considered as a consequence of this theory. it is shown that weak magnetic fields in interstellar clouds will be amplified, and, if external mechanisms are available to reduce the compressional effects of shock waves, the field will reach a value, where p is the pressure. also, some aspects of the internal motions of prominences are considered ,. it is shown that gauss will yield results in accord with the observational material.
