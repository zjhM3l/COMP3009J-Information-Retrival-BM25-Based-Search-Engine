elastic stability of circular cylindrical shells stabilized by a soft elastic core. the effect of a soft elastic core upon the buckling strength of a thin, circular, cylindrical shell is investigated experimentally. two types of loading are considered.. (a) axial compression, and (b) uniform radial-band loading, where the width of the band is small compared to the length of the shell. for each type of loading it is shown that the strengthening effect of the elastic core becomes more significant with the increasing values of the radius-thickness ratio. for example, it is shown that for the geometric and elastic constants considered it is possible, with the presence of the core, to increase the axial buckling stress by as much as 65 percent over the values found for those without an elastic core. the elastic core is even more effective in stabilizing the shell against buckling due to band loading, the peak pressure required to buckle the filled specimen being 7.30 times that required to buckle the unfilled shell.
