heat transfer through laminar boundary layers on semi-infinite cylinders of arbitrary cross section. this paper shows how to calculate the rate of heat transfer through a laminar boundary layer on a semi-infinite cylinder of arbitrary cross section. the cylinder is placed in a stream of incompressible fluid, the flow at infinity being parallel to the generators, and is maintained at a uniform temperature. a series solution for small downstream distances and an asymptotic formula for large downstream distances are given. to cover the intermediate range an approximate pohlhausen solution is obtained,. a correction of the error involved in the pohlhausen solution is suggested which, it is believed, will lead to final errors of at most 2 percent. the calculations are applied to elliptic cylinders, and illustrate the effect on the local rate of heat transfer of varying the ratio of the major and minor axes of cross section, the length of perimeter being held fixed.
