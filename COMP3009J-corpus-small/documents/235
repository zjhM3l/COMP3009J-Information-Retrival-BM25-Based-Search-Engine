on the minimisation and numerical evaluation of wave drag. a fourier analysis of the linearised theory expression for the zero-lift wave drag of a smooth, slender body in terms of its cross-sectional area distribution is used to derive the area distribution which minimises the expression for given length, volume, nose area, base area and n intermediate areas. another minimal deduced from this by relaxing the restriction on volume is used to evolve a method for the numerical evaluation of the original expression. two practical applications of these results are discussed. the first is in the design of wing-body combinations to have small drag rise at transonic speeds. the second is in the calculation of the wave drag of wing-body combinations at zero lift,. an example is constructed to illustrate the method and to give an indication of its accuracy.
