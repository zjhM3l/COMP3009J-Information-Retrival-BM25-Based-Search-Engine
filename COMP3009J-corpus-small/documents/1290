measured and calculated subsonic and transonic flutter characteristics of a 45 sweptback wing planform in air and in freon-12 in the langley transonic dynamics tunnel. in order to investigate the reliability of flutter data measured in the langley transonic dynamics tunnel, an experimental and theoretical subsonic and transonic flutter study has been conducted in air and in freon-12 in this facility. the wing planform employed had an aspect ratio of 4.0, a taper ratio of 0.6, and 45 of quarter-chord sweepback. a sting-mounted full-span model was tested in addition to three sizes of wall-mounted semispan models. a wide range of mass ratio was covered by the tests in air and by flutter calculations made by the modified strip-analysis method of naca research memorandum l57l10. a limited amount of data was obtained in freon-12. results of the tests in air and in freon-12 are in good agreement with the flutter calculations at all mach numbers. the test data compare favorably with previously published transonic flutter data for the same wing planform. the results indicate that flutter characteristics obtained in freon-12 may be interpreted directly as equivalent flutter data in air at the same mass ratio and mach number.
