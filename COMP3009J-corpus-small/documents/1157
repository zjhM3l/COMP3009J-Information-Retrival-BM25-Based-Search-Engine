hypersonic shock tunnel. a hypersonic shock tunnel has been developed for obtaining fluid mechanic information at the high mach numbers and corresponding stagnation temperatures encountered in flight by long range ballistic vehicles and satellites. this report describes the hypersonic shock tunnel and presents some of the results obtained in the driven tube and in the nozzle helium is ignited in the driver to produce strong shock waves in air. a shock velocity in air as high as 55,000 fps with a calculated equilibrium temperature of 16,000 k has been produced in the driven tube. the effects of high stagnation temperatures upon the detached shock wave and the pressure distribution for blunt bodies have been observed in the nozzle test section. the detachment distance devreased greatly at high temperatures. the pressure distribution for the hemisphere was found to be less than that predicted by the modified newtonian theory. shock wave boundary layer interaction at the leading edge of a flat plate was observed, and the results agreed with the analytical prediction. a detached shock wave was observed for a blunt two-dimensional body at very low densities in the test section with a flow mach number of 19.6.
