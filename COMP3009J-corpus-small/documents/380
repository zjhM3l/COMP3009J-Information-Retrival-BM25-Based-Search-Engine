effect of quasi-steady air forces on incompressible bending-torsion flutter. explicit solutions are obtained for the bending-torsion flutter of a two-dimensional airfoil in incompressible flow under the assumptions that the theodorsen function, c(k) is set equal to a real constant, and the diagonal virtual mass terms are negligible. for the case of small bending to torsion frequency ratio, a comparison is made of these quasi-steady solutions with an earlier empirical expression suggested by theodorsen and garrick for the nonsteady case, and the effect of the c(k) function is indicated. the importance of the c.g. location for these small cases is re-emphasized, and the possibility of flutter at zero air speed is indicated.
