wall interference at transonic speeds on a hemisphere cylinder model. tests have been made in three n.p.l. wind tunnels on a pressure-plotting model consisting of a long cylinder with a hemispherical nose. the surface pressure distributions were measured for stream mach numbers between 0.7 and 1.1 at zero model incidence, and schlieren photographs were taken. the blockage ratios were 0.211(, 0.117( and 0.120(. the principal feature of the flow is the effect of working section size on the rate at which the terminal shock wave moves back along the model with increasing stream mach number. this is thought to depend mainly on the distance from the model to the slotted walls of the tunnel, and not necessarily on the blockage ratio. the distance of the solid sidewall is important in influencing the local mach number ahead of the terminal shock, by reflecting the expansion-wave system originating near the model nose.
