on some fourier transforms in the theory of non-stationary flows. the growth of lift on a airfoil starting impulsively from rest to a uniform velocity has been given by wagner (1925). the steady-state lift due to circulation on an airfoil oscillating sinusoidally and moving with uniform velocity has been given by theodorsen the present paper based essentially on the material of n. a. c. a. report no. 629 by the author, discusses some reciprocal relations of the nature of fourier transforms existing between the functions of wagner and theodorsen. kussner (1936) has already shown that wagner's function may be derived from theodorsen's function. by means of a superposition principle it is possible to utilize these fundamental functions to treat general problems in transient expression which is accurate to within 2 percent is given for wagner's function. this expression leads to a good approximate expression for theodorsen's function in terms of the exponential integral, instead of hankel functions. an analogy is drawn between transient hydrodynamic flows and transient electrical flows. kussner (1936) has introduced a function describing the growth of lift on an airfoil entering a sharp edged vertical gust region. this function bears a certain relation to wagner's function which is briefly discussed.
