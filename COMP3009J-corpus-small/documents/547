boundary layer characteristics of caret wings. the theory of laminar boundary layers along flat surfaces has been used in conjunction with eckert's approximations to the displacement thickness, skin friction and temperature profiles on the undersurface of a caret wing configuration. to a first approximation it has been assumed that parallel flow exits behind the shock outside the boundary layer, and the displacement of the shock by the boundary layer near the leading edge is neglected. conduction of heat within the body and along the surface is neglected but radiation is included, so that are found. examples are given for various altitudes and configurations and the effect of the skin friction on the lift drag ratio calculated, assuming the undersurfaces to be plane.
