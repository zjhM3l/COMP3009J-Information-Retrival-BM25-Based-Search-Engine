a method for calculating the subsonic steady-state loading on an airplane with a wing of arbitrary planform and stiffness. a method for computing the steady-state span load distribution on an elastic airplane wing for specified airplane weights and load factors is given. the method is based on a modification of the weissinger l-method and applies at subcritical mach numbers. it includes the effects of external stores and fuselage on the spanwise loading. modifications are outlined for treating tail-boom and tailless airplane configurations and for calculating the divergence dynamic pressure of a swept wing with a large external store. a method is also outlined for reducing wind-tunnel data to obtain effective aerodynamic coefficients which are free of model flexibility effects. the effects of mach number can readily be evaluated from the aerodynamic coefficients thus obtained.
