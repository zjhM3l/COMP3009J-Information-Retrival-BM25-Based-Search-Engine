the occurrence and development of boundary layer separations at high incidences and high speeds. this note describes the manner in which the onset of the effects of boundary-layer separation varies with mach number for two-dimensional aerofoils, and discusses the influence of section shape as far as it is known. a brief qualitative description is given of the mechanism underlying the development of the separated flow and its effects, followed by a discussion of some of the ways in which this is likely to differ for swept-back wings at high speeds. finally, the need is emphasized for continued work in a broadening field.
