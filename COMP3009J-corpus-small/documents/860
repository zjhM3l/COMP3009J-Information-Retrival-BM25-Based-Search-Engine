test of an aerodynamically heated multi-- web wing structure (mw-1) in a free jet at mach number 2. a multiweb wing structure, representing an airplane or missile wing, was tested under simulated supersonic flight conditions to determine the transient temperature distribution. the aerodynamic loads played an important and unanticipated role, however, in that the model experienced a dynamic failure near the end of the test. the test is discussed and the conclusion reached that the model failed as a result of the combined action of aerodynamic heating and loading. the temperature data collected are analyzed and are shown to be in reasonable agreement with calculated values.
