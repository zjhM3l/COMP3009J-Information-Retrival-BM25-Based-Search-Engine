the interaction of a reflected shock wave with the boundary layer in a shock tube. ideally, the reflection of a shock from the closed end of a shock tube provides, for laboratory study, a quantity of stationary gas at extremely high temperature. because of the action of viscosity, however, the flow in the real case is not one-dimensional, and a boundary layer grows in the fluid following the initial shock wave. in this paper simplifying assumptions are made to allow an analysis of the interaction of the shock reflected from the closed end with the boundary layer of the initial shock afterflow. the analysis predicts that interactions of several different types will exist in different ranges of initial shock mach number. it is shown that the cooling effect of the wall on the afterflow boundary layer accounts for the change in interaction type. an experiment is carried out which verifies the existence of the several interaction regions and shows that they are satisfactorily predicted by the theory. along with these results, sufficient information is obtained from the experiments to make possible a model for the interaction in the most complicated case. this model is further verified by measurements made during the experiment. the case of interaction with a turbulent boundary layer is also considered. identifying the type of interaction with the state of turbulence of the interacting boundary layer allows for an estimate of the state of turbulence of the boundary layer based on an experimental investigation of the type of interaction.
