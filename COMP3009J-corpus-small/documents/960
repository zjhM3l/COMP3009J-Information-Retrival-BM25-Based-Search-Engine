investigation of free turbulent mixing. a discussion of the integral relations for flow of the boundary-layer type is presented. it is shown that the characteristic laws of spread of jets, wakes, and so forth, can be obtained directly for the laminar case and, with the help of dimensional reasoning, for the turbulent case as well. measurements of the mean velocity, the intensity and scale of the turbulent fluctuations, and of the turbulent shear in a two-dimensional mixing zone are presented. the results of these measurements are compared with the mixing-length theories. it is shown that both mixing length and exchange coefficient vary across the mixing zone. the theories based on the assumption of constant mixing length or exchange coefficient are thus in error. a discussion of the energy balance of the fluctuating motion is given and the triple correlation is estimated.
