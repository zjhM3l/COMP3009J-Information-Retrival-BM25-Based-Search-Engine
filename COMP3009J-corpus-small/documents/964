on the theory of discharge coefficients for round entrance flowmeters and venturis. a theory of rounded-entrance flowmeters, based on a consideration of the potential and boundary-layer flows in a converging nozzle, is constructed. curves are presented showing the discharge coefficient as a function of diameter reynolds number, with the /total equivalent length tional length-diameter ratio of the contraction section of the asme long-radius nozzle is presented. the theoretical curves of discharge coefficient versus diameter reynolds number are in good agreement with experiment over a range of reynolds number from 1 to 10. the theory provides a rational framework for correlating and extrapolating experimental results,. it shows the effects of contraction shape and location of pressure taps,. it furnishes values of discharge coefficient for untested designs,. and it suggests precautions to be taken in design, installation, and operation.
