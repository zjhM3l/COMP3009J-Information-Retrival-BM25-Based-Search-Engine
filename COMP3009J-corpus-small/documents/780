the transonic characteristics of 38 cambered rectangular wings of varying aspect ratio and thickness as determined by transonic-bump technique. an investigation to determine the effects of camber on the aerodynamic characteristics of a series of rectangular wings having various aspect ratios and thickness-to-chord ratios was conducted in the ames the transonic-bump method. the mach number range of the investigation was from 0.6 to 1.12, with a corresponding reynolds number range of 1.7 to 2.2 million. the lift, drag, and pitching-moment data are presented for wings having aspect ratios of 4, 3, 2, 1.5, and 1, and naca 63a2xx and 63a4xx sections with thickness-to-chord ratios of
