inviscid hypersonic flow over blunt-nosed slender bodies. at hypersonic speeds the drag area of a blunt nose is much larger than the drag area of a slender afterbody, and the energy contained in the flow field in a plane at right angles to the flight direction is nearly constant over a downstream distance many times greater than the characteristic nose dimension. the transverse flow field exhibits certain similarity properties directly analogous to the flow similarity behind an intense blast wave found by g. i. taylor, s. c. lin, and a. sakurai. a comparison with the experiments of hammitt, vas, and bogdonoff on a flat plate with a blunt leading edge at in helium shows that the shock-wave shape is predicted very accurately by this similarity analysis. the predicted surface pressure distribution is somewhat less satisfactory. experimental results on a hemisphere-cylinder obtained at in the galcit air tunnel indicate that not only the shock-wave shape but also the surface pressures for this body are given very closely by the similarity theory, except near the hemisphere-cylinder junction. energy considerations combined with a detailed study of the equations of motion show that flow similarity is also possible for a class of bodies of the form, provided that, where for a two-dimensional body and for a body of revolution. when the shock shape is not similar to the body shape, and the entire flow field some distance from the nose must depend to some extent on the details of the nose geometry. by again utilizing energy and drag considerations one finds that at hypersonic speeds the inviscid surface pressures generated by a blunt leading edge are larger than the pressures induced by boundary-layer growth on an insulated flat surface for an insulated blunt-nosed slender body of revolution the corresponding distance is given by. (here is free-stream reynolds number based on leading-edge thickness, or nose diameter.) in free flight these constants are replaced by 1,700 and 20, respectively, so that viscous interaction effects are important over the forward portion of a blunt- nosed slender body only for relatively low values of. however, /far downstream/ of the nose the inviscid over-pressure is small and viscous interaction phenomena will have to be taken into account.
