the unsteady lift of a wing of finite aspect ratio. unsteady-lift functions for wings of finite aspect ratio have been calculated by correcting the aerodynamic inertia and the angle of attack of the infinite wing. the calculations are based on the operational method. the starting lift of the finite wing is found to be only slightly less than that of the infinite wing,. whereas the final lift may be considerably less. the theory indicates that the initial distribution of lift is similar to the final distribution. curves showing the variation of lift after a sudden unit change in angle of attack, during penetration of a sharpedge gust, and during a continuous oscillation are given. operational equivalents of these functions have been devised to facilitate the calculation of lift under various conditions of motion. as an application of these formulas, the vertical acceleration of a loaded wing caused by penetrating a gust has been calculated.
