jet effects on base pressure of conical afterbodies at mach 1. 91 and 3. 12. data are presented which show the effect of a jet on base pressure for a series of conical afterbody-jet-nozzle combinations having boat-tail angles that varied from 0 to 11 and base-to-jet diameter ratios that varied from 1.11 to 2.67. the jet nozzles had exit angles from 0 to 20 and were designed for exit mach numbers from 1.0 to 3.2. pressure ratios up to 30 were tested for both a cold (air) and a hot numbers of 1.91 and 3.12. in general, base pressure increased for increasing values of boat-tail angle, nozzle angle, jet temperature, and jet total pressure and for decreasing values of base-to-jet diameter ratio, jet mach number, and free-stream mach number. the addition of tail surfaces produced only small changes in base pressure. for all variables, base pressure is governed by the maximum pressure rise that can be supported by the wake fluid in the region of the trailing shock. the wake pressure ratio is in turn governed by the jet and free-stream mach numbers adjacent to the wake region and by the state of the boundary layer on the boattail and on the nozzle. values of wake pressure ratio computed using the theory of korst, page, and childs were in good agreement with experimental values for convergent nozzles.
