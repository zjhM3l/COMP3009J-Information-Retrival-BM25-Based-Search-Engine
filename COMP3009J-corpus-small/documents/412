critical combinations of shear and transverse direct stress for an infinitely long flat plate with edges elastically restrained against rotation. an exact solution and a closely concurring approximate energy solution are given for the buckling of an infinitely long flat plate under combined shear and transverse direct stress with edges elastically restrained against rotation. it was found that an appreciable fraction of the critical stress in pure shear may be applied to the plate without any reduction in the transverse compressive stress necessary to produce buckling. an interaction formula in general use was shown to be decidedly conservative for the range in which it is supposed to apply.
