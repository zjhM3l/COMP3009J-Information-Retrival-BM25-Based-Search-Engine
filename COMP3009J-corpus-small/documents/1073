a practical method for numerical evaluation of solutions of partial differential equations of the heat-conduction type. three approximate methods for the solution of the nonlinear equation of heat flow in a medium where heat is being generated by a chemical reaction are compared. the equations are where subscripts indicate partial differentiations and q, k, a are
