tunnel interference effects. the problems of solid blockage, wake blockage, lift effect, and the influence of boundary constraint at high mach number are considered in detail. corrections are given for various open and closed tunnels, rectangular, circular and octagonal, and different speeds, two and three dimensional flows, with several aerofoils and wings. other interferences include the wall boundary layer, gradient of static pressure and problems with the working fluid used.
