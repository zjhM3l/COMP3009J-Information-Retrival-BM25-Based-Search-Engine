an investigation of laminar transitional and turbulent heat transfer on blunt-nosed bodies in hypersonic flow. laminar, transitional, and turbulent heating rates have been measured by means of the shrouded model technique. the reynolds number was varied over a ninefold range,. the enthalpy ratio (stagnation to wall) varied from 2.3 to approximately 1.5. two different pressure distributions were imposed on the model which consisted of a spherically capped cone. the experimental data are compared to the laminar hypersonic boundary-layer theory and shown to be in good agreement on the conical portion of the model. on the spherical portion the data are approximately 20 per cent higher than the theoretical prediction. some of this discrepancy can be attributed to radiation to the nose of the model. the fully developed turbulent heat-transfer data are compared to two theories.. (1) a relatively simple turbulent theory which is based on recent theoretical work and which takes into account the upstream history of the boundary layer, and (2) the flat-plate reference-enthalpy theory, which depends on only /local/ conditions. although both theories are in reasonable agreement with the data, the latter method is simpler and somewhat more accurate. for transitional flow the theory mentioned first can be readily modified in order to permit reasonable estimates of transitional heat transfer to be obtained. on this basis it is possible to estimate laminar, transitional, and fully developed turbulent heat transfer under hypersonic blunt-body conditions. the behavior of transition reynolds number based on momentum thickness is also discussed and shown to be in quantitative agreement with recent shock-tube measurements.
