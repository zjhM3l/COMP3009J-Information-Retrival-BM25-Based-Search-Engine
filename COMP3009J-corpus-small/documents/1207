supersonic airfoil performance with small heat addition. an analytical method is presented which permits a very rapid evaluation of the acrodynamic effects arising from the addition of small amounts of heat near supersonic two-dimensional airfoils. this method applies to shockless inviscid flow without heat conduction. also, the mechanism by which the sesired heat addition is achieved is not considered. it is shown that even small amounts of heat generate a substantial pressure rise and thus cause appreciable changes in the acrodynamic coefficients. the results of this analysis compare favorably with those obtained by a more accurate, but also more tedious, graphical method of characteristics. two possible modes of application to an airplane design are considered from the energy requirements standpoint. in this connection, it is shown that the decrease of the required wing area resulting from heat addition may, in some cases, lead to savings in the rate of the fuel consumption. in general, however, one should not expect any substantial reduction in energy requirements resulting from the application of the wing heat addition.
