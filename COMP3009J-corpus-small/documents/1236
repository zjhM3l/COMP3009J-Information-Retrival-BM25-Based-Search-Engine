the stagnation point boundary layer in the presence of an applied magnetic field. similarity equations for axisymmetric compressible flow are obtained, assuming that the magnetic field is uniform, normal to the surface, and unaffected by the flow, and that the conductivity varies as the nth power of the enthalpy. numerical solutions are given for a number of values of n and of the field strength, and are used to modify the estimates of heat-transfer made by the author using inviscid theory (title source 26, 536-537, 1959).
