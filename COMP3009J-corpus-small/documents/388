the pressure gradient induced by shear flow past a flat plate. article is a continuation of an earlier note on papers by li on a semiinfinite plate in a uniform shear flow. li had deduced from the form of his equations that stream vorticity caused an induced pressure gradient in the flow. later papers by li and murray (amr 15(1962), rev. 7157) support the induced pressure gradient theory. the author notes, however, that the mathematics used by li and murray are not acceptable and the problem thus not resolved. the present note sets up simple models of complete flows examinable by elementary means. author holds that analyses demonstrate conclusively that no pressure gradient is induced in the boundary layer on a flat plate in a limited region of shear flow. he notes that the original question in the case of unbounded shear remains obscure--and anyway an unlimited shear layer is not of great practical importance.
