simplified method for determination of the critical height of distributed roughness particles for boundary layer transition at mach numbers from 0 to 5. a simplified method has been devised for determination of the critical height of three-dimensional roughness particles required to promote premature transition of a laminar boundary layer on models of airplanes or airplane components in a wind tunnel with zero heat transfer. a single equation is derived which relates the roughness height to a reynolds number based on the roughness height and on local flow conditions at the height of the roughness, and charts are presented from which the critical roughness height can be easily obtained for mach numbers from 0 to 5. a discussion of the use of these charts is presented with consideration of various model configurations. the method has been applied to various types of configurations in several wind-tunnel investigations conducted by the national advisory committee for aeronautics at mach numbers up to 4, and in all cases the calculated roughness height caused premature boundary-layer transition for the range of test conditions.
