compressive buckling of simply supported curved plates and cylinders of sandwich construction. theoretical solutions are presented for the buckling in uniform axial compression of two types of simply supported curved sandwich plates.. the corrugated-core type and the isotropic-core type. the solutions are obtained from a theory for orthotropic curved plates in which deflections due to shear are taken into account. results are given in the form of equations and curves.
