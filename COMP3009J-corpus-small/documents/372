an experimental investigation of flow about simple blunt bodies at a nominal mach number of 5. 8. an experimental investigation was conducted in the galcit hypersonic wind tunnel to determine flow characteristics for a series of blunt bodies at a nominal mach number of 5.8 and free-stream reynolds numbers per in. of measured values for the pressure coefficient distributions are compared with a modified newtonian expression. the agreement is very good for the three-dimensional bodies and is fair for the circular cylinder transverse to the free-stream flow direction. a complete report of the investigation is given in a galcit hypersonic wind tunnel memorandum.
