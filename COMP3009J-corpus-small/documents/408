on convective motion of a conducting fluid between parallel vertical plates in a magnetic field. stationary convective motion of a conducting fluid between vertical parallel plates in a magnetic field is considered. an exact solution of the magnetohydrodynamic equations is obtained for the case of a constant vertical temperature gradient. the critical value of grasshof's number is determined for the case when the temperature of both plates is the same.
