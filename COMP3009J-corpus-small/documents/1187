shock-induced boundary layer separation in overexpanded conical exhaust nozzles. the flow in overexpanded supersonic nozzles is reviewed. although five essentially different flow regimes can be discerned, depending on the nozzle pressure ratio, the regime of most interest to the engine designer is the one characterized by oblique shock patterns in the nozzle and flow separation from the nozzle wall. it is shown that the pressure rise associated with the separation correlates well with the mach number at the separation point. a simple analytical formulation for the pressure rise required to separate the flow provides excellent agreement with experimental data over a wide range of nozzle operating conditions and allows prediction of overexpanded nozzle performance.
