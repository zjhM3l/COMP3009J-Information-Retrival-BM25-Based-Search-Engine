collapse by instability of thin cylindrical shells under external pressure. this paper discusses the collapse by instability of thin-walled cylindrical vessels subjected to external pressure. the most important of the theoretical and empirical formulas that apply to this subject are presented in a common notation. a new and simple instability formula is developed. three classes of tubes are considered.. tubes of infinite length,. tubes of finite length with uniform radial pressure only,. and tubes of finite length with both uniform radial and axial pressure. collapsing pressures calculated by the various formulas are presented in tabular form as a means of comparing the formulas. the formulas are discussed briefly and checked against the results of tests conducted at the u. s. experimental model basin for the bureau of construction and repair, navy department. this paper is a sequel to one previously published as a part of the work of the a.s.m.e. special research committee on the strength of vessels under external pressure.
