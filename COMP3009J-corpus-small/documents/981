solutions to the heat-conduction equation with time dependent boundary conditions. design charts based on the analytical solution to the problem of one-dimensional heat flow in a solid body of constant material properties with time-dependent boundary conditions were presented by kaye and yeh. this solution dealt with aerodynamic heating at hypersonic speeds where the surface coefficient of heat transfer and the temperature potential were taken to be linear functions of time of flight. in order to make these charts of more general application, general solutions are presented which, together with the charts, enable rapid and reasonable estimates to be made of the transient temperature distributions in many practical cases.
