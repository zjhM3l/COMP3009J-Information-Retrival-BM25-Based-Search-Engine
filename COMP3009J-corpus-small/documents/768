formulae for use with the fatigue load meter in the assessment of wing fatigue life. this note gives a method for the derivation of suitable constants which, when multiplied by the readings recorded at each appropriate acceleration level on a fatigue load meter and then added together, give directly the proportion of fatigue life used up in the wing. it is suggested that when the estimated proportion is of order 80, then a more detailed assessment of fatigue life should be made.
