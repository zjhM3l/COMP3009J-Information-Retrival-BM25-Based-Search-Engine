tables of exact laminar-boundary layer solutions when the wall is porous and fluid properties are variable. the three partial differential equations of the laminar boundary layer for two-dimensional steady-state compressible flow have been transformed into two ordinary differential equations by the method of pohlhausen, falkner, and skan. the ordinary equations include parameters for expressing the simultaneous effects of pressure gradient in the main-stream flow through a porous wall and property changes in the fluid due to large temperature differences between the wall and the free stream. a total of 58 cases have been solved numerically by the method of picard. the euler number (nondimensional pressure-gradient parameter) ranges in value from 1 (stagnation-point value) to the negative values found at the laminar separation points. three rates of flow through the porous wall were considered (including the impermeable case where the flow rate is 0). five temperature ratios (stream temperature divided by wall temperature) were used.. the uncooled and unheated case (temperature ratio of 1), two cooled cases (temperature ratios of ture ratios of and ). velocity, weight-flow, and temperature distributions are tabulated as are the dimensionless stream function of falkner and skan and its derivatives and the dimensionless temperature function of pohlhausen and its derivatives. for each case, displacement, momentum, and convection thicknesses, as well as nusselt number and coefficient of friction at the wall, were computed.
