an investigation of optimum zoom climb techniques. the problem of optimal zoom climb maneuvering of a turbojet aircraft has been investigated using the mayer formulation of the calculus of variations. the euler-lagrange equations governing optimum symmetric flight have been integrated numerically by digital computation. discontinuities in thrust arising from turbojet afterburner blowout have been treated, and conditions which must be satisfied across the interface generated by the discontinuity have been derived. arbitrary control techniques have been compared with the optimum, and it has been found that performance is relatively insensitive to piloting technique unless a time limitation is imposed which requires high maneuvering load factors.
