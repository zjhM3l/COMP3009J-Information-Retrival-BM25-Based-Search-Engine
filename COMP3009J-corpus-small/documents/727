a study of the acoustic fatigue characteristics of some flat and curved aluminium panels exposed to random and discrete noise. a study was made of the fatigue life of simple 2024-t3 aluminum-alloy panels measuring 11 by 13 inches and exposed to both discrete-frequency noise from a siren and random noise from an air jet. noise levels varied from approximately panel variables included thickness, edge conditions, curvature, and static-pressure differential. no significant differences were noted in the nature of failures experienced for the two types of loadings. at a given root-mean-square stress level, the failure times were generally shorter for the random loading than for the discrete-frequency loading. these differences in failure times were noted to be a function of stress level, the larger differences occurring at the lower stress levels. increases in time to failure were obtained as a result of increased panel thickness, increased panel curvature, and particularly for increased static-pressure differential across curved panels. for the discrete-type loading, the location of weak points in these simplified structural designs can be satisfactorily accomplished but quantitative predictions of fatigue life are much more difficult.
