a theoretical study of the aerodynamics of slender cruciform-wing arrangements and their wakes. a theoretical study is made of some cruciform-wing arrangements and their wakes by means of slender-body theory. the basic ideas of this theory are reviewed and equations are developed for the pressures, loadings, and forces on slender cruciform wings and wing-body combinations. the rolling-up of the vortex sheet behind a slender cruciform wing is considered at length and a numerical analysis is carried out using 40 vortices to calculate the wake shape at various distances behind an equal-span cruciform wing at 45 bank. analytical expressions are developed for the corresponding positions of the rolled-up vortex sheets using a 4-vortex approximation to the wake, and these positions are compared with the positions of the centroids of vorticity resulting from the numerical analysis. the agreement is found to be remarkably good at all distances behind the wing. photographs of the wake as observed in a water tank are presented for various distances behind a cruciform wing at 0 and 45 bank. for 45 bank, the distance behind the wing at which the upper two vortices pass between the lower two is measured experimentally and is found to agree well with the the calculation of loads on cruciform tails is considered in some detail by the method of reverse flow, and equations are developed for the tail loads in terms of the vortex positions calculated in the earlier analyses.
