hypersonic viscous flow over a flat plate. in dealing with the steady laminar viscous flow over a semi-infinite flat plate some of the following topics are discussed. the streamline in the boundary layer over a leading edge of given thickness. the rate of growth of the boundary layer in the main stream, and causes of pressure variations. asymptotic solutions for thn downstream flow region, including the joining interaction of shock waves at the leading edge. pressure variations in the interanl viscous flow layer and in external inviscid flow considered as prandtl meyer flow. in cases of streamline deflection, the free stream mach number, zero pressure gradient, and surface pressure distribution. asymptotic solutions for cases of fluid injection of a cool gas. prandtl heat transfer. the joining interaction between the external inviscid flow and the internal viscous flow layer. steady laminar hpyersonic viscous flow over a flat wedge and a cone.
