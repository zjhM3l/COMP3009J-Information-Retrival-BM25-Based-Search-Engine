on transverse vibrations of thin, shallow elastic shells. the deformation and complete stress distribution are determined for each of the following edge-loaded thin shells.. (1) a right circular cylinder, (2) a frustum of a right circular cone, and (3) a portion of a sphere. the locations of maximum circumferential and meridional stresses are also found. equations are developed for discontinuity shear and moment at the following junctions.. circular cylinder, (2) axial change of thickness in a cone, (3) change of thickness in a portion of a sphere, cylinder and a portion of a sphere,
