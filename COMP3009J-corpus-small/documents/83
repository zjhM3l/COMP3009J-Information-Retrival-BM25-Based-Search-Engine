discussion of solar proton events and manned space flights. as a result of studies made during the international geophysical year (igy) and the international geophysical cooperation (igc), it is known that a considerable fraction of large solar flares give rise to almost pure streams of protons which reach the earth and continue to arrive for as long as 11 days. the energies of these particles lie within a very steep spectrum extending from 20 to least 500 mev. because of the frequency of large flares during times of high solar activity, and owing to the long duration of each solar proton emission, these particles were present in detectable intensity near the top of the earth's atmosphere for about 15 percent of the time from 1957 to 1960. the number of large flares that accelerated and released these particles during this three-year period was about 30. the event that began on august 22, 1958 contributed greatly toward the understanding of the solar and terrestrial sequence of events, and in addition provided the first identification of the emitted particles. a flare on may of protons in the neighborhood of the earth that this phenomenon was recognized as an additional radiation hazard to manned vehicles in the high atmosphere and in most parts of the solar system. the three very intense events that occurred in july, 1959 further supported this conclusion, and the possibility of predicting such events became an important consideration. in addition to its value in the protection of human beings, effective forecasting clearly would be of great value in the detailed scientific study of this phenomenon. this paper presents a preliminary discussion of some aspects of predicting the arrival of protons at the earth following the appearance of solar activity features and, equally important, of forecasting the periods when this penetrating radiation is unlikely to occur.
