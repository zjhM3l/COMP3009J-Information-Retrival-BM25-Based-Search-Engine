calculations for the stability of thin conical frustums subjected to external uniform hydrostatic pressure and axial loads. calculations are presented for the problem of the stability of conical shells subjected to combined external uniform hydrostatic pressure and axial tension or compression. stress interaction curves are found to vary only slightly as a function of the ratio of the end radii of the cone.
