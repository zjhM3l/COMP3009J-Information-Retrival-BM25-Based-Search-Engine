on the vibration of thin cylindrical shells under internal pressure. the frequency spectra and vibration modes of thin-walled circular cylinders subjected to internal pressure are considered. it is shown that for very thin cylinders the internal pressure has a significant effect on the natural vibration characteristics. for these cylinders, particularly those having smaller length to diameter ratios, the mode associated with the lowest frequency is in general not the simplest mode. the exact number of circumferential nodes, n, which occur in the mode associated with the lowest frequency, depends on the internal pressure p. if this number n is large, it decreases rapidly with increasing p when p is small, and the /fundamental/ frequency--the lowest frequency at each p--increases rapidly with increasing internal pressure. at higher values of internal pressure the frequency spectrum tends to be arranged in the regular manner, the frequency increases with the increasing number of circumferential nodes, and the lowest frequency rises slowly with the internal pressure. experimental results on the frequency spectra, vibration modes, and structural damping of a series of thin-walled cylinders subjected to internal pressure are briefly described. these results show agreement with the features predicted by reissner's the effect of slight deviation of the cylinder from perfect circular symmetry is discussed.
