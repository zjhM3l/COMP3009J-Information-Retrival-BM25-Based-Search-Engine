on full dispersed shock waves in carbon dioxide. it is pointed out that, for shock mach numbers between 1 and that the adjustments in the energy in all the degrees of freedom proceed slowly and in parallel and occur over a distance large compared with the mean free path. theoretical velocity profiles for such shock waves are given and found to be in excellent agreement with interferometric shock-tube observations.
