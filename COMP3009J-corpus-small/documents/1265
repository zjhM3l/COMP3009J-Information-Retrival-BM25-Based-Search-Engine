on the thrust hypothesis for the jet flap including jet-mixing effects. this paper is concerned with the thrust generated by a jet flap. it is shown that a /linear/ thrust hypothesis can be obtained, provided linearized potential flow is assumed. in fact, the linearized problem of a jet-flap system is found to be the linear combination of a lift problem and a thrust problem. the lift problem gives all the lift generated, but it is of interest to note that the thrust problem would yield all the thrust developed by the jet flap within the limitation of the linearized theory. the mixing of the jet flap with the surrounding fluid is analyzed by the momentum-integral method. the analysis substantiates stratford's suggestion for obtaining an increase of thrust by causing the jet to mix with the main stream in a region of high suction. finally, some approximate formulas, relating the thrust and the jet angle, are derived. the drag of the airfoil section and other viscous effects are, however, not considered.
