calculation of flutter characteristics for finite-span swept or unswept wings at subsonic and supersonic speeds by a modified strip analysis. a method has been developed for calculating flutter characteristics of finite-span swept or unswept wings at subsonic and supersonic speeds. the method is basically a rayleigh type analysis and is illustrated with uncoupled vibration modes although coupled modes can be used. the aerodynamic loadings are based on distributions of section lift-curve slope and local aerodynamic center calculated from three-dimensional steady-flow theory. these distributions are used in conjunction with the /effective/ angle-of-attack distribution resulting from each of the assumed vibration modes in order to obtain values of section lift and pitching moment. circulation functions modified on the basis of loadings for two-dimensional airfoils oscillating in a compressible flow are employed to account for the effects of oscillatory motion on the magnitudes and phase angles of the lift and moment vectors. flutter characteristics have been calculated by this method for 12 wings of varying sweep angle, aspect ratio, taper ratio, and center- of-gravity position at mach numbers from 0 to as high as 1.75. comparisons of the results with experimental flutter data indicate that this method gives generally good flutter results for a broad range of wings.
