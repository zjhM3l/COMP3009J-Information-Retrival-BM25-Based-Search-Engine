some effects of joint conductivity on the temperature and thermal stresses in aerodynamically heated skin-stiffener combinations. temperatures and thermal stresses in typical skin-stiffener combinations of winglike structures subjected to aerodynamic heating have been obtained with the aid of an electronic differential analyzer. variations were made in an aerodynamic heat-transfer parameter, in a joint conductivity parameter, and in the ratio of skin width to skin thickness. the results, which are presented in nondimensional form, indicate that decreasing the joint conductivity parameter lowers both the interior and the average temperature ratios, increases the peak thermal stress ratios in the skin, and may considerably increase the peak stiffener stress ratios,. increasing the aerodynamic heat-transfer parameter decreases the interior and average temperature ratios, increases the peak skin stress ratios somewhat, but greatly increases the peak stiffener stress ratios,. and increasing the ratio of skin width to skin thickness produces only moderate decreases in the peak skin stress ratios while moderately increasing the peak stiffener stress ratios.
