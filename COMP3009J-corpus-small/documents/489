on calculation of the laminar separation point and results of certain flows. paper studies compressible laminar boundary layer in adverse pressure gradient. after mentioning mathematical instabilities in howarth's and like solutions, authors quote equation from one of the references, based on the assumptions that zero heat transfer and y = 1.4. thence authors compute nondimensional distances to separation, comparing with solutions by other workers. results are interesting, though reviewer feels rather unhappy about approximations leading to eq. (4),. more detailed justifications should have been given. thus we have the statement ber, as./ surely a fuller discussion of effects of letting is warranted. typography in eqs. (2) and (3) is rather confusing and there is a typographical error in heading to table 2.
