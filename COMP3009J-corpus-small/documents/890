comments on 'thermal buckling of clamped cylindrical shells'. in the recent paper by zuk, an expression was presented for the critical buckling temperature of a clamped cylindrical shell in terms of the material and geometrical properties of the shell. restraint at the edges of the shell was assumed to be provided by rigid frames experiencing no temperature rise. the circumferential stress induced in the shell when it experienced a temperature rise, t, may be approximated by the function. in other words, there is a compressive circumferential stress along the entire length, l, of the shell. it is well known, however, that the discontinuity stresses introduced at the junction of a shell and a rigid frame (or bulk-head) are extremely localized, and the circumferential stresses induced in the shell decrease rapidly away from the joint.
