the supersonic boom of a projectile related to drag and volume. the whitham theory predicting the far-flow field around a projectile is used to derive body shapes which produce extreme bow shock-wave pressure jump or /boom,/ subject to constraining conditions regarding the drag due to the bow shock and fineness ratio of the bodies. it is found that the minimum drag body is also the minimum boom body. the body-volume effect and the effect of discontinuities in slope of the body meridian section on the boom intensity is investigated. as a general result of the investigation, it can be said that the boom of a projectile for given mach number and flight altitude is primarily determined by its length and fineness ratio. the maximum variation in the boom intensity for pointed bodies with given length and fineness ratio is of the order of 10 per cent. the geometry of the bodies is thus found to play a minor role.
