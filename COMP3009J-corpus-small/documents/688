tables of aerodynamic coefficients obtained from developed newtonian expressions for complete and partial conic and spheric bodies at combined angles of attack and sideslip with some comparisons with hypersonic experimental data. closed-form expressions and tables composed from these expressions are presented for complete and partial conic and spheric bodies at combined angles of attack and sideslip in newtonian flow. aerodynamic coefficients of these bodies are tabulated for various body segments over a range of angles of attack from 1degree to 85degree and angles of sideslip from 0degree to 15degree. some comparisons between newtonian predictions and hypersonic experimental aerodynamic characteristics were made for conic bodies having various surface slopes, nose bluntnesses, and body cross sections to indicate the range of validity of the theory. in general, the theory is shown to agree quite well with experimental results for sharp-nose complete cones and for configurations having large blunted noses and steep surface slopes. however, agreement between theory and experiment generally is poor for the more slender, slightly blunted complete or half conic bodies and also for sharp-nose half conic bodies where real-flow phenomena such as forebody interference, viscous forces, leeward surface contributions, or leading-edge pressure reductions may have significant effect. the agreement between theory and experiment for the bodies considered can be improved by using the stagnation pressure coefficient behind a normal shock rather than 2 as the newtonian coefficient, although for the sharp-nose half conic bodies there is no theoretical justification for this modification.
