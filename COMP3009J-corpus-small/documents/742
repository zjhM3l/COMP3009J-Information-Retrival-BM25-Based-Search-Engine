post-buckling behaviour of axially compressed circular cylinder shells. the postbuckling characteristics of an axially compressed thin-walled circular cylindrical shell loaded either by dead weights or by a rigid testing machine are determined. it is shown that for either loading condition the minimum applied stress in the postbuckling region is 0.182(er) and that the region of stable equilibrium corresponding to loading by the rigid testing machine includes and extends beyond that obtained with dead weight loading. the work here described is a continuation of work done earlier by von karman and tsien, by michielsen, and by leggett and jones.
