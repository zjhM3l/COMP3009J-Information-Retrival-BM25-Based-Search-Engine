bodt freedom flutter of ground launched rocket models at supersonic and high subsonic speeds. a theoretical investigation of symmetric body freedom flutter of a rocket model is described. the results confirm that structural failures of models were caused by this type of flutter, and an extension of the investigation indicates the parameters that are of importance. a high ratio of body to wing mass and a well forward position of the overall centre of gravity are conditions under which flutter may occur. increase of body pitching radius of gyration and tailplane volume are beneficial. it is concluded that this type of flutter may be significant in some aircraft designs, and that the canard has no advantage in this respect over the conventional lay-out of wing and tailplane.
