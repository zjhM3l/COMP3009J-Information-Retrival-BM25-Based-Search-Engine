the behaviour of a cylindrical shell under axial compression when the buckling load has been exceeded. the value of the compressive stress at which a thin circular cylindrical shell becomes unstable has been worked out theoretically by southwell (1914). subsequent experimental results, however, have indicated that this value is appreciably too high and that the form of distortion which occurs in practice differs from that assumed in theory. in recent years much work has been done on this problem in america. lundquist (1933) and donnell (1934) have concluded that the buckling of a cylindrical shell is greatly influenced by initial irregularities,. von karman and tsien (1941) have indicated that a thin cylindrical shell can be maintained in a buckled state by a compressive load considerably smaller than that previously predicted by theory. the present paper is an extension of the work of von karman and tsien. it shows that the smallest load which will keep a thin cylindrical shell in a buckled condition is about one-third of that given by southwell, a result in very fair agreement with experiment, and that once the cylinder has buckled, and so long as the stresses remain within the elastic range of the material, the cylinder has only about one-quarter of its original stiffness.
