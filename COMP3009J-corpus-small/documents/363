an alternative formulation of the problem of flutter in real fluids. it is well known, in steady flow, that the actual lift curve slope is somewhat less than that predicted by inviscid flow theory, even at small angles of attack. as the stall angle is approached, the lift curve slope continually decreases and thus deviates even more from the theoretical value. pinkerton employed the measured circulation to determine the pressure distribution and found that the resulting prediction of the moment is considerably improved over that given by the classical theory. this amounts to replacing the conventional kutta-joukowski condition with the condition that the total lift should agree with the measured value, and this, in turn, completely determines the flow pattern. practically, this is accomplished by giving a fictitious camber to the profile. since potential flow theory is valid outside of the boundary layer, once the boundary-layer thickness is known, the potential flow may be corrected for the displacement thickness and the viscous wake by appropriate source distributions. the boundary layer cannot be evaluated, of course, until the potential flow is known and the circulation is applied. a criterion to determine the circulation, by generalizing the kutta-joukowski condition, was proposed by preston and spence by assuming that the pressure at the trailing edge shall have the same value when determined from the potential-flow values above and below the airfoil. this procedure gives qualitative information concerning viscous effects in steady flow.
