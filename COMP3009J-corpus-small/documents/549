experimental study of the velocity and temperature distribution in a high-velocity vortex-type flow. the vortex tube represents a simple device in which a particular type of vortex motion may be studied in the laboratory in an attempt to obtain a better understanding of such flows. such an investigation has been pursued in the heat transfer laboratory of the university of minnesota. the present paper summarizes the major results of this vortex-tube investigation.
