a simple method of matric structural analysis, part iv, non-linear problems. the method presented in the previous parts is employed to solve various kinds of nonlinear problems, such as problems concerning large deflections or buckling, or thermal creep, or inelastic stress redistribution involving thermal gradients, or design. the procedure used in each case is one of direct iteration--i. e., after one assumes a starting point all subsequent cycles are self-generating. simple numerical examples are worked out.
