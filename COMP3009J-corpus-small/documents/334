influence of the leading-edge shock wave on the laminar boundary layer at hypersonic speeds. in order to bring out the importance of the leading-edge region at hypersonic speeds, the influence of the leading-edge shock wave on the laminar boundary layer is investigated in two simple cases of steady flow over a semi-infinite, insulated flat plate.. (1) sharp leading edge., (2) blunt leading edge, as approximated by a normal shock wave. the streamlines that enter the boundary layer over a large region of the plate surface has previously crossed the shock wave very near the leading-edge, where the shock is strong and highly curved. consequently, the temperature at the outer edge of the boundary layer is appreciably higher than free-stream temperature, and the vorticity there is not zero. the effects of this shock-wave larger than the usual /errors/ made in the boundary-layer theory, and an estimate of these effects can therefore be obtained within the framework of that theory. the numerical magnitude of the shock-wave influence is found to be appreciable. for the case of the blunt leading edge the slope of the curve of induced pressures plotted against the hypersonic interaction parameter closely approaches the experimental data of hammitt and bogdonoff obtained in helium at large values of this parameter. these approximate results show that the influence of the leading-edge region at hypersonic speeds requires careful theoretical and experimental study.
