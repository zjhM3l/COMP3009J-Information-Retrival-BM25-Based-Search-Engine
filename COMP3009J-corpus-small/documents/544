a theoretical and experimental study of oscillating wedge shaped aerofoils in hypersonic flow. aerodynamic stiffness and damping derivatives have been measured in a /hypersonic gun/ wind tunnel for sharp and blunt-nosed two dimensional single wedge shapes oscillating in the pitching mode in hypersonic flow. the results, which have been compared with theoretical prediction, modified to account for leading edge bluntness, show that this may increase the damping by up to 50 percent for certain axis positions. details of the experimental technique designed to measure the derivatives in the short running times available are described.
