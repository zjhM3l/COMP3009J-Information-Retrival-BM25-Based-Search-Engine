on combined free and forced convection laminar magnetohydrodynamic flow and heat transfer in channels with transverse magnetic field. combined free and forced convective heat transfer in vertical channels has been studied by many researchers. due to the need for engineering design information there have been many papers concerning cases of fully developed flow with varying wall temperature. forced flows in a channel of electrically conducting fluid with a transverse magnetic field have been studied and the large effects of a magnetic field on the flow pattern have been established. flows of combined free and forced convection in electrically conducting fluids in vertical channels with a transverse magnetic field are expected to attract attention in future engineering applications, for example, in a magneto-hydrodynamic generator or in plasma studies. however, except for a report by gershuni and zhukhovitskii (1) concerning a particular case, no general study has been published. this paper is a general treatment of fully developed, free and forced convective, laminar, magneto-hydrodynamic flow in a vertical channel with a transverse magnetic field. it includes combined free and forced convective flows in channels without a magnetic field reported by ostrach (2), tao (3), etc. as special cases. hartmann flow (4) is included in the other limit.
