similar solutions of a free convection boundary layer equation for an electrically conducting fluid. author investigates the existence of a class of similar solutions for free convection from a vertical flat plate, such as are known for free convection in a nonconducting fluid. the magnetic field acts transversely to the fluid motion and is assumed to remain constant in the direction perpendicular to the plate. this introduces into the momentum equation a retarding force which is a function only of x, the distance along the plate length. for similarity it is found that the magnetic inductance must vary as. if the plate temperature is constant. if n = 0, the magnetic inductance is constant while the plate temperature increases linearly with x.
