effect of jet pluming on the static stability of cone-cylinder-flare configurations at a mach number of 9. 65. the effects of jet pluming on normal force and pitching moment of have been measured at a free-stream mach number of 9.65 with reynolds numbers based on model length of 500,000 to 600,000. geometric variables included nose bluntness, flare half-angle, and nozzle geometry and exit displacement. two test nozzles with design mach numbers of 3.74 and 4.60 were operated with compressed air to simulate the initial jet-boundary shape of a particular solid-propellant rocket motor operating between altitudes of 165,000 and 215,000 feet. the ratio of the jet pressure to free-stream static pressure varied from a jet-off condition to approximately 1,300 for the nozzle with design mach number of 3.74, and from a jet-off condition to approximately 280 for the nozzle with design mach number of 4.60. the angle-of-attack range was from 0 to approximately 6. the results indicate that as the jet-pressure ratio was increased the size of the jet plume increased, and as a result the model static stability was decreased. increasing the angle of attack resulted in a reduction in static instability during the jet-on condition. increasing nose bluntness resulted in a more forward movement of the center of pressure when jet-plume interference was not present and a rearward movement in the center of pressure when jet interference was present. increasing the nozzle-area expansion ratio and displacing the nozzle exit downstream of the flare base resulted in a more rearward location of the center of pressure.
