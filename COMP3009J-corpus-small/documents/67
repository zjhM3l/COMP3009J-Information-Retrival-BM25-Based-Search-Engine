dynamic stability of vehicles traversing ascending or descending paths through the atmosphere. an analysis is given of the oscillatory motions of vehicles which traverse ascending and descending paths through the atmosphere at high speed. the specific case of a skip path is examined in detail, and this leads to a form of solution for the oscillatory motion which should recur over any trajectory. the distinguishing feature of this form is the appearance of the bessel rather than the trigonometric function as the characteristic mode of oscillation.
