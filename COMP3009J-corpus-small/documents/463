physical properties of plastics for photo-thermoelastic investigation. the optical and physical properties of paraplex p43, castolite, and epoxy resin hysol 6000-op, which are potentially of interest in photothermoelastic investigations, were investigated over a temperature range from +100 to -60 f. results on the thermal-expansion coefficient, the material fringe value, and the modulus of elasticity as functions of temperature are presented. also evaluated were thermal properties of importance in heat conduction. photothermoelastic figures of merit, which rate the optical sensitivity of materials in photothermoelastic applications, as well as a new method to determine this figure in a relative manner are presented.
