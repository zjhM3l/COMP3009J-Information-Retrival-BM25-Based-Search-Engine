calculation of potential flow about bodies of revolution having axes perpendicular to the free-stream direction. a general method is described for calculating, with the aid of an electronic computer, the potential flow about arbitrary bodies of revolution whose axes are perpendicular to the free-stream direction. when combined with the solution for the axisymmetric flow about these bodies, this method makes it possible to calculate the pressure distribution on any body of revolution at angle of attack forward of any separated region of the flow, and also to calculate the flow at points off the body surface. after the basic equations of the method have been derived, its accuracy is exhibited by comparison with analytic solutions for ellipsoids of revolution. calculated pressure distributions are then compared with experimental data for a variety of bodies. the agreement is quite satisfactory in all cases. the calculated velocities for other selected bodies are presented to exhibit certain properties of this type of flow.
