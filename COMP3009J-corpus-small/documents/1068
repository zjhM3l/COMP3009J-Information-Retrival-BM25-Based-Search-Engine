instability analysis of cylindrical shells under hydrostatic pressure. to determine the elastic buckling pressure of simply supported cylindrical shells subjected to lateral and axial hydrostatic forces, various versions of linear bending theories have been employed in the past. for certain shell dimensions, however, the expressions commonly used may yield substantially differing results. in what follows, recent work on this problem by a. e. armenakas and the writer is briefly reviewed. this work consisted primarily in employing a general bending theory of circular cylindrical shells under the influence of initial stress, developed earlier by the same authors, to re-examine the problem mentioned, and compare the results with those of previous investigations. the outcome was the establishment of a simple but accurate expression for the buckling pressure applicable to a wide range of shell dimensions.
