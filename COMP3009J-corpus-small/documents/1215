the effect of slip particularly for highly cooled walls. it is found that for boundary conditions on the velocity slip and on the temperature jump which are not oversimplified in an unrealistic way, the effect of these phenomena on the heat transfer and the shear at a stagnation point is of the order of the ratio of the mean free path outside the boundary layer to the boundary-layer thickness, even for highly cooled walls. a simplified theory of this effect is given, which puts the physical reasons for the results in evidence and agrees closely with the more accurate calculations. it is concluded that the effects of slip and jump are not negligible in comparison with other low-reynolds-number corrections, even for very cold walls.
