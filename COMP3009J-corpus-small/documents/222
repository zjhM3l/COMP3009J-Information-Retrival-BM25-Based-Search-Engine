the flow over delta wings at low speeds with leading edge separation. a low speed investigation of the flow over a 40 apex angle delta wing with sharp leading edges has been made in order to ascertain details of the flow in the viscous region near the leading edge of the suction surface of the wing. a physical picture of the flow was obtained from the surface flow and a smoke technique of flow visualization, combined with detailed measurements of total head, dynamic pressure, flow directions and vortex core positions in the flow above the wing. surface pressure distributions were also measured and integrated to give normal force coefficients. the results of this investigation were compared with those of other experimental investigations and also with various theoretical results. in particular, the normal force coefficients, vortex core positions and attachment line positions were compared with the theoretical results of mangler and smith, reference 19. it was found that.. exist on the upper surface of the wing outboard of and below the main vortices. these secondary vortices are formed as a result of separation of the boundary layers developing outboard of the top surface attachment lines.
