transition in the viscous wakes of blunt bodies at hypersonic speeds. transition from laminar to turbulent flow in the hypersonic wakes of spheres was detected in laboratory measurements of the radiation from the flow field. a hypervelocity gun facility was used to fire models, 0.22-in. in diameter, into a range at velocities from 10,000 to 17,000 ft sec. experiments were performed by changing.. (a) the material of the projectile ,. (b) the ambient gas in the range ,. and (c) the pressure in the range. three optical techniques were used to observe the wake radiation.. which show a turbulent viscous wake as the pressure in the range is decreased from one atmosphere to about 20 cm hg. which show the luminous flow field at pressures between 30 and ence of short luminous streaks, which disappear suddenly as the pressure is decreased below 3 cm hg for air, and below 0.8 cm hg for argon. both air and argon, which show the main features of the flow field. above the transition pressure, the intensity of radiation from the wake is always associated with fluctuations that appear to be the same phenomenon as the drum-camera streaks. the appearance of the streaks in the drum camera and photo-multiplier data is interpreted as transition from laminar to turbulent flow in the viscous wake, because experimental evidence shows that their appearance is not controlled by chemical, radiative, or ablative processes, but depends on aerodynamic effects. this conclusion is supported by other experiments based on optical and schlieren techniques. the transition in the wake at positions very close to the body is given by a local reynolds number of 10 for air, and 3 x 10 for argon. the results indicate a possible local-mach-number effect.
