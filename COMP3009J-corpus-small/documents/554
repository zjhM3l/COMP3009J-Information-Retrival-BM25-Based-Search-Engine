generalized heat transfer formulas and graphs. utilizing the research results of previously reported investigations of the laminar, turbulent and radiative heat transfer in dissociated air, some generalized formulas for calculating heat transfer are given. graphs for determining the laminar heat transfer, momentum thickness reynolds number, and turbulent heat transfer distributions around an axisymmetric body are also given. these heat transfer correlations are valid for velocities between 6000 and 26,000 fps and for altitudes up to 250,000 ft. this range of velocities and altitudes covers the important re-entry regime of practical re-entry trajectories having interest today. in the last section of this report these generalized results are specialized for icbm nose cone re-entry applications. these formulas and graphs may be found useful for making rapid engineering estimates and preliminary design evaluations of the heating problems associated with re-entry into earth's atmosphere.
