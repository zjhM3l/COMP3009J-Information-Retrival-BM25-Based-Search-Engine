thermal diffusion effects on energy transfer in a turbulent boundary layer with helium injection. a circular cylinder with two-inch diameter and with a porous wall fabricated out of woven wire material was aligned with its axis parallel to an air stream with approximately 100 ft sec velocity. helium gas was injected into the turbulent boundary layer through the cylinder walls at a uniform rate in the range 1.55 x 10 to 1.08 x 10 of the free stream mass velocity. the local energy transfer along the cylinder was measured at various values of the wall temperature level for the situation that the energy flows from the cylinder to the boundary layer and vice versa. the results showed clearly that the wall temperature for zero energy transfer - the adiabatic wall temperature - was larger than the free stream temperature by up to about 40 f, although viscous dissipation effects are negligible. this temperature excess increases with increasing injection rate and is independent of reynolds number. an analysis in which the laminar sublayer is treated as couette flow with helium injection and which includes thermal diffusion in this layer is formulated. the results show appreciable thermal diffusion effects on adiabatic wall temperature, increasing it over its value for zero injection by amounts of the same order of magnitude as found by measurements. thermal diffusion however has negligible effects on the heat transfer coefficient. its effects on the concentration and temperature distribution are discussed and are shown to produce appreciable modifications in the latter.
