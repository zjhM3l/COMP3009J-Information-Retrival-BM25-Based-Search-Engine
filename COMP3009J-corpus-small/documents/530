an aerodynamic analysis for flutter in oseen-type viscous flow. oseen's equations for unsteady flow are employed to obtain a linearized solution based on a discontinuous-wake model. the analysis is employed to estimate the viscous correction to unsteady lift and moment at large reynolds number. if the asymptotic solution is not too slowly convergent, the correction is of the order of the ratio of the logarithm of reynolds number to the reynolds number. the theory is preliminary in nature as it is limited by the accuracy of oseen's equations and is restricted to small angle of attack. however, it also shows that the generalized trailing-edge condition for potential flow is reasonable and might predict the essential correction in a real fluid.
