on the conservativeness of various distributed force systems. the necessity of determining the conservativeness of force systems in instability problems is discussed in reference 1. it is shown that, whereas kinetic methods are generally applicable for the determination of instability loads, the statical methods usually employed are valid only for conservative and nongyroscopic systems. small changes in the character of the loading could make an otherwise conservative system nonconservative and cause a large change in the magnitude of the buckling load. the buckling load of the cantilever column example in reference 1 is, for tangential end loading, eight times that for conservative, constant directional loading.
