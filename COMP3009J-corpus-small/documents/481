mass transfer cooling of a laminary boundary layer by injection of a light weight foreign gas. analytical predictions are given for the development of the velocity, temperature and concentration fields in a laminar air boundary layer on a flat plate in high-speed dissipative flow, the plate being considered porous and cooled by injection of hydrogen from its surface. the admixture of hydrogen, having a low density and high thermal capacity relative to air, is shown to greatly diminish the skin friction and to markedly relieve the adverse thermal effects of intense aerodynamic heating under conditions of hypersonic flow.
