free-flight measurements of the static and dynamic. the effects of contamination of helium by air upon static-pressure, total-pressure, heat-transfer, and temperature measurements have been investigated in the 2-inch helium tunnel at the langley research center. within the scope of the tests, even a small amount of air is shown to affect these measurements. the heat-transfer and temperature measurements were made on a 26.6 half-angle cone and demonstrated the effects of contamination qualitatively. the wall static and center-line pitot pressures show that if the contaminating air is held to less than about 0.2 percent by volume, the error in indicated mach number is less than 1 percent as calculated from the rayleigh pitot equation. the corresponding errors in wall static and center-line pitot pressures are about 1.7 and 0.4 percent, respectively.
