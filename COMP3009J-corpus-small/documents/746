aeroelastic problems in connection with high speed flight. a review is given of developments in the field of aeroelasticity during the past ten years. the effect of steadily increasing mach number has been two-fold.. on the one hand the aerodynamic derivatives have changed, and in some cases brought new problems, and on the other hand the design for higher mach numbers has led to thinner aerofoils and more slender fuselages for which the required stiffness is more difficult to provide. both these aspects are discussed, and various methods of attack on the problems are considered. the relative merits of stiffness, damping and massbalance for the prevention of control surface flutter are discussed. a brief mention is made of the recent problems of damage from jet efflux and of the possible aeroelastic effects of kinetic heating.
