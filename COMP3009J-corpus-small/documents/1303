air pressure on a cone moving at high speeds. the cone is considered to be moving at a velocity higher than that of sound, so that there is in front of it a shock wave, moving with the same speed as the cone itself. in the first part of the paper, the case is investigated mathematically where the flow is irrotational, and the pressure, velocity and density of the air stream are each constant over the surfaces of cones coaxial with the moving solid cone. the complete solution is obtained in numerical form, for cones of semi-vertical angle of the paper, the results are compared with experiment, both in respect of pressure distribution as measured in a wind tunnel, and also (for the 30 cone) by comparison with photographs of bullets in flight. in the latter case the theory should only be applicable if the speed is 1.46 or more times the velocity of sound, and it is in fact found in the photographs, that the nature of the wave alters at about this velocity. the exact solution found, is compared with an approximation given recently by v. karman and moore. this should be valid for thin spindle-shaped bodies, and does in fact agree well in the case of the cone of 10 semi-vertical angle, but diverges increasingly from the truth as the angle is increased.
