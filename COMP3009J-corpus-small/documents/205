a correlation of airfoil section data with the aerodynamic loads measured on a 45 sweptback wing at subsonic mach numbers. an investigation has been made of the possibility of correlating airfoil section data with measured pressure distributions over a 45 sweptback wing in the mach number range from 0.50 to 0.95 at a free-stream reynolds number of approximately 2 million. the wing had an aspect ratio of 5.5, a taper ratio of 0.53, naca 64a010 sections normal to the quarterchord line, and was mounted on a slender body of revolution. at mach numbers of 0.85 and below, and for wing normal-force coefficients below the maximum normal-force coefficient for an infinite-aspect-ratio wing yawed 45 to the flow (derived from airfoil section data by simple sweep relations), good correlation was obtained over most of the wing between wing-section and two-dimensional-airfoil pressure distributions. for greater normal-force coefficients lateral boundary-layer flow permitted the inboard wing sections to rise to high maximum section normal-force coefficients. the effectiveness of this lateral boundary-layer flow disappeared towards the tip. for all mach numbers, the influence of plan-form effects on the pressure distributions limited the quality of the correlation at the 20- and 95-percent-semispan stations. above a mach number of about 0.85 the shock waves originating at the juncture of the body and the wing trailing edge spread over the span, preventing further application of two-dimensional data. the spanwise load distributions at moderate normal-force coefficients could be predicted from span-loading theory for the entire mach number range of the tests.
