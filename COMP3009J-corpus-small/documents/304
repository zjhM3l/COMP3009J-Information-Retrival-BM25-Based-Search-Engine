first-order approach to a strong interaction problem in hypersonic flow over an insulated flat plate. the present paper concerns with the strong interaction phenomenon over an insulated semi-infinite flat plate with a sharp leading edge. in particular the main interest is in the consistent treatment in which the boundary-layer solution may be joined continuously with the inviscid solution regarding flow variables including pressure, normal velocity, temperature (or streamwise velocity) and density. it is shown that the behavior of the inviscid solution may be consistent with that of the boundary-layer solution to at least first-order approximation that is correct to the order of, where m is the mach number of undisturbed flow, r the reynolds number based on the distance from leading edge and the ratio of specific heats. then the first-order boundary-layer problem is formulated under such an external circumstance and an attempt is made for arriving at the solution. actual calculations are carried out for both cases of air and helium. from the solution it is found that the region in which the viscous effect plays a significant role is ranged over from 0 to a certain finite value of n, say n, in terms of the similarity coordinate n in the corresponding incompressible boundary layer. the numerical results moreover indicate that the induced pressure is considerably smaller than the estimate of lees (7) obtained by his approximate method in which the effect of the first-order induced pressure on the boundary layer is ignored and no survey of the first-order boundary-layer equation is made. the present results are also found to be in excellent agreement with experimental data recently obtained in helium flow by erickson (15).
