inviscid hypersonic flow past blunt bodies. two methods are shown for the calculation of the flow field between a blunt body and the shock associated with it for the case of hypersonic flow. real gas effects are included. the solutions consider only symmetric flows--that is, symmetric bodies at zero incidence. one method consists in tracing successive stream tubes around the body and leads to iterations on the initially assumed position of the shock. the second is an integral method closely analogous to the karman-pohlhausen procedure for boundary layers. a distinction is made between round-nosed and flat-nosed bodies, and both cases are discussed. a specific example corresponding to a re-entry missile situation is calculated,. the two methods agree within a few per cent. comparison is also made with other known solutions in the stagnation region.
