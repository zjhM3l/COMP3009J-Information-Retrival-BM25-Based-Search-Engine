a sensor for obtaining ablation rates. a variable-capacitance ablation-rate sensor which allows continuous measurements of ablation rates for teflon and similar polymers has been developed and tested in an ethylene-heated high-temperature jet at stagnation temperatures ranging from 2,400degree to 3,800degree f. the data /length changes/ were measured by using the same telemeter equipment as that used in rocket-propelled flight vehicles. test results indicate measurement error to be a maximum of 4 percent between the telemetered length changes and the length changes that were obtained from photographic records of the test.
