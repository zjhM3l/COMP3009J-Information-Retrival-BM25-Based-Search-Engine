recent studies on the effect of cooling on boundary layer transition at mach 4. the advent of high-speed flight has necessitated the study of boundary-layer transition on highly cooled bodies. investigations such as those of references 1-4 have concentrated on this problem and have indicated, contrary to the trends predicted by small-disturbance theory, that premature transition can be found with cooling. this phenomenon, commonly called detail in references 2-5. the purpose of this note is to report some recent transition data obtained on a cooled cone in a mach 4 wind tunnel. the model, a sharp-tip cone (included angle 13.5), was cooled by liquid nitrogen to a temperature of -340 f. the cooling method and the data analysis are similar to that described in reference 3.
