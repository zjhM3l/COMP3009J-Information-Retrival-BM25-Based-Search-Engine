calculated velocity distributions and force derivatives for a series of high-speed aerofoils. the polygon method of woods is used to calculate the velocity distribution over a number of two-dimensional aerofoils at low incidence, subcritical flows only being considered. lift slopes and aerodynamic centres at zero lift are also calculated. some comparisons with experimental results are made, and these show good agreement at zero incidence.
