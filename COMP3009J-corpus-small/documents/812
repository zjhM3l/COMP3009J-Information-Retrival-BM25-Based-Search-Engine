investigation of two bluff shapes in axial free flight over a mach number range from 0. 35 to 2. 15. a fineness-ratio-2.71 right circular cylinder and a fineness- ratio-been tested in free flight over a mach number range of 0.35 to 2.15 and a reynolds number range of 1 x 10 to 12 x 10. time histories, cross plots of force coefficients, rolling velocity, and longitudinal-force coefficient are presented for both cylinders. in addition, cross plots of moment coefficients and plots of the normal-force curve slope and the aerodynamic center are presented for the fineness-ratio-2.71 cylinder. the average aerodynamic center of the right circular cylinder moved rearward with decreasing speeds until at the subsonic mach numbers it remained approximately constant and comparisons of the drag data of this test with wind tunnel and other free-flight data show good agreement. an appreciable decrease in drag was observed when the data of the present test of the rounded nose cylinder were compared with data of a right circular cylinder of a similar configuration.
