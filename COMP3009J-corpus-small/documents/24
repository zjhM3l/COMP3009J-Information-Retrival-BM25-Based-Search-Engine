theory of stagnation point heat transfer in dissociated air. the boundary-layer equations are developed in general for the case of very high speed flight where the external flow is in a dissociated state. in particular the effects of diffusion and of atom recombination in the boundary layer are included. it is shown that at the stagnation point the equations can be reduced exactly to a set of nonlinear ordinary differential equations even when the chemical reactions proceed so slowly that the boundary layer is not in thermochemical equilibrium. two methods of numerical solution of these stagnation point equations are presented, one for the equilibrium case and the other for the nonequilibrium case. numerical results are correlated in terms of the parameters entering the numerical formulation so as not to depend critically on the physical assumptions made. for the nonequilibrium boundary layer, both catalytic (to atom recombination) and noncatalytic wall surfaces are considered. a solution is represented which shows the transition from the /frozen/ boundary layer (very slow recombination rates) to the equilibrium boundary layer (fast recombination rates). a recombination rate parameter is introduced to interpret the nonequilibrium results, and it is shown that a scale factor is involved in relating the equilibrium state of a boundary layer on bodies of different sizes. it is concluded that the heat transfer through the equilibrium stagnation point boundary layer can be computed accurately by a simple correlation formula and that the heat transfer is almost unaffected by a nonequilibrium state of the boundary layer provided the wall is catalytic and the lewis number near unity.
