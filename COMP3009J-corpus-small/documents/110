dynamics of a dissociating gas. this is a lucid introduction to the effects of dissociation in gas dynamics. the problem in view is that of air flow past a bluff body at speeds somewhat above 2 km sec. thermodynamic equilibrium is assumed,. theories of near equilibrium for transport properties and of large departures from equilibrium being promised in parts 2 and 3. following a survey of the equilibrium statistical thermodynamics of a pure dissociating diatomic gas, a new model is introduced. this /ideal dissociating gas/ is characterized by only three constants, the characteristic temperature, density and internal energy for dissociation. physically, it may be regarded as having its vibrational modes always just half excited (so that at low temperatures the ratio of specific heats approaches 4 3 rather then 7 5). thermodynamic properties of the ideal gas are derived, and the oblique shock wave relations deduced in the /strong-shock/ approximation (including an elegant relation between the principal curvatures of any bow shock and the subsequent vorticity). useful relations are given for the isentropic changes that take place along streamlines between shocks. various of these results are applied to the problem typified by a sphere flying at high mach number. the newtonian impact theory and its empirical modification are dismissed as lacking theoretical basis, in favor of the limit for large values of both mach number and density ratio across the shock. it is suggested that the zero surface pressure sometimes predicted by the latter theory corresponds to separation not of the flow but of the shock wave from the surface. an estimate is given for the subsequent shape of the shock. finally, another approximation is applied to the region near the stagnation streamline. the fluid is assumed incompressible, but rotational in accord with the shock relations,. and it is shown that a spherical shock corresponds to a concentric spherical body. the resulting surface pressure is within 1 per cent of that predicted by freeman's second approximation based on the newtonian-plus-centrifugal solution (same j. 1 (1956),
