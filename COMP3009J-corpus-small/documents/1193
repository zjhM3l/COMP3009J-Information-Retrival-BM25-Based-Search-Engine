some exact solutions for cavitating curvilinear bodies. a special case of cavitating flow solutions is postulated and transformed to a semi-infinite plane. the complete, exact solution then is synthesized by superposition of singularities. the solution is relevant to a general, two-parameter family of curvilinear bodies. the parameters are the flow angles at the two points of flow separation. the body reduces, in the special case, to the rayleigh solution for a flat plate. the equations of the cavity boundaries are given in explicit form. the body form and the stagnation streamline are given as the locus of the roots of a cubic equation. local static pressures and, hence, lift and drag, also may be calculated. the generated solutions constitute a technique involving simple computation for exact solutions of a special family of cavitating curvilinear bodies at finite angles of attack.
