wake of a satellite traversing the ionosphere. the particle treatment is applied to a study of the structure of the wake behind a charged body moving supersonically through a low-density plasma. for the case of a body whose dimensions are considerably smaller than a debye length, a solution is obtained which is very similar in structure to the solution obtained by using the linearized fluid dynamics equation. for the case of a disk whose radial dimensions are much larger than a debye length, two conical regions are found in the wake. at the surface of each of these cones, over thicknesses of the order of a debye length, the ion and electron densities are increased over their ambient values. formulae for the electrohydrodynamic drag on a wire, and on a large disk are obtained.
