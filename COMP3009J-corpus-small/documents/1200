hypersonic viscous flow over a sweat-cooled flat plate. this paper presents a theoretical analysis of the hypersonic viscous flow over a sweat-cooled flat plate. the physical system under consideration is the hypersonic laminar boundary layer over a porous flat plate with homogeneous, normal injection of a coolant into the external stream. a heat balance at the porous surface is made between the heat transferred to the surface and the heat absorbed by the coolant. the existence of similar solutions requires a nonuniform distribution of coolant injection. the method of solution consists of the integration of three simultaneous first-order equations, the momentum and the energy integral equations in the boundary layer, and the tangent-wedge approximation in the inviscid layer. first-order asymptotic formulas are given in both the strong and the weak pressure interaction regions for the induced surface pressure, the skin-friction coefficient, and the nusselt number. numerical results for three specific cases are presented and discussed.
