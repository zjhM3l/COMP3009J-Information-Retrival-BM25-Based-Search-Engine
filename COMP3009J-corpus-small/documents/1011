free-flight measurements of the static and dynamic. charts have been prepared relating the thermodynamic properties of air in chemical equilibrium for temperatures to 15,000 k and for pressures from 10 to 10 atmospheres. also included are charts showing the composition of air, the isentropic exponent, and the speed of sound. these charts are based on thermodynamic data calculated by the national bureau of standards.
