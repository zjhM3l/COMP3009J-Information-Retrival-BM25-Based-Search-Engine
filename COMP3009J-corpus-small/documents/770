the flow of a compressible fluid past a sphere. the flow of a compressible fluid past a sphere fixed in a uniform stream is calculated to the third order of approximation by means of the janzen-rayleigh method. the velocity and the pressure distributions over the surface of the sphere are computed and the terms involving the fourth power of the mach number, neglected in rayleigh's calculation, are shown to be of considerable importance as the local velocity of sound is approached on the sphere. the critical mach number, that is, the value of the mach number at which the maximum velocity of the fluid past the sphere is just equal to the local velocity of sound, is calculated for both the second and the third approximations and is found to be, respectively, and.
