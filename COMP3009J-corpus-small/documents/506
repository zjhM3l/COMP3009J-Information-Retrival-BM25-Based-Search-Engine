a note on havelock's shallow-water wave-resistance curves. in the continuous quest for improved means of transportation, attention is currently focused on the ground-effect machine. as there is no physical contact between the vehicle and the terrain over which it operates, its performance should be similar over land and water. however, over water there is an additional resistance to motion due to the gravity-wave system generated by the supporting or /cushion/ pressure acting on the water surface. estimates of this component can be made using the analysis of t. h. havelock. it is the purpose of this note to present an ibm 650 digital-computer solution of his equations. as shown below, these results differ from havelock's original results.
