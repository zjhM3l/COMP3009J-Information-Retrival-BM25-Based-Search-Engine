effects of extreme surface cooling on boundary layer transition. an investigation was made to determine the combined effects of surface cooling, pressure gradients, nose blunting, and surface finish on boundary-layer transition. data were obtained for various body shapes at a mach number of 3.12 and reynolds numbers per foot as high as 15x10. previous transition studies, with moderate cooling, have shown agreement with the predictions of stability theory. for surface roughnesses ranging from 4 to 1250 microinches the location of transition was unaffected with moderate cooling. with extreme cooling, an adverse effect was observed for each of the parameters investigated. in general, the transition reynolds number decreased with decreasing surface temperature. in particular, the beneficial effects of a favorable pressure gradient obtained with moderate cooling disappear with extreme cooling, and a transition reynolds number lower than that observed on a cone is obtained. further, an increase in the nose bluntness decreased the transition reynolds number under conditions of extreme cooling.
