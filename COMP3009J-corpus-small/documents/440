compilation of information on the transonic attachment of flows at the leading edge of airfoils. schlieren photographs have been compiled of the two-dimensional flow at transonic speeds past 37 airfoils having variously shaped profiles, some of which are related and vary in thickness and camber. the data for these airfoils were analyzed to provide basic information on the flow changes involved and to determine factors affecting transonic-flow attachment, which is a transition from separated to unseparated flow at the leading edges of two-dimensional airfoils at fixed angles of attack as the subsonic mach number is increased.
