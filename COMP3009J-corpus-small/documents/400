buckling stress of clamped rectangular plates in shear. by consideration of antisymmetrical, as well as symmetrical, buckling configurations, the theoretical shear buckling stresses of clamped rectangular flat plates are evaluated more correctly than in previous work. the results given, which represent the average of upper and lower-limit solutions obtained by the lagrangian multiplier method, are within percent of the true buckling stresses.
