some stall and surge phenomena in axial flow compressors. observations of rotating stall have shown that a wide variety of stall patterns is possible. hot-wire anemometer data on a multistage compressor have shown a progressive-type stall at low speeds. the amplitude of the flow fluctuations increases in magnitude through the first few stages and then diminishes rapidly to a small value in the latter stages. a stage-stacking analysis has shown that rotating stall will exist over a large portion of the compressor map at low speeds but will be instigated almost simultaneously with compressor surge at high speeds. blades failures attributable to resonant vibrations excited by rotating stall have been experienced in single and multistage compressors. in the stage-stacking analysis no deterioration of stage performance due to unsteady flow resulting from stall of adjacent stages was considered. in general, the pressure drop at the stall point is believed to be much larger than indicated by an analytical formulation of compressor performance. compressor surge is attributed to a limit cycle operation about the compressor stall point, and, as indicated in a few compressor tests and in jet-engine tests, a small compressor discharge receiver volume may result simply in stall of the compressor without the cyclic characteristics of compressor surge. in this event, engine operation will be limited because of the large drop in performance which accompanies compressor stall.
