convection of a pattern of vorticity through a shock wave. an arbitrary weak spatial distribution of vorticity can be represented in terms of plane sinusoidal shear waves of all orientations and wave lengths (fourier integral). the analysis treats the passage of a single representative weak shear wave through a plane shock and shows refraction and modification of the shear wave with simultaneous generation of an acoustically intense sound wave. applications to turbulence and to noise in supersonic wind tunnels are indicated.
