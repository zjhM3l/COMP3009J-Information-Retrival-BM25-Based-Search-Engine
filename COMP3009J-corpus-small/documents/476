the blasius equation with three-point boundary conditions. the blasius equation subject to three-point boundary conditions, describing the interaction between two parallel streams, is solved by way of a series in terms of ascending powers of the ratio equals /u1 -dash u2//u1, where the u1's are the outer streams' velocities. the first three terms of the series are analytically expressed in terms of the repeated integrals of the complementary error function /im erfc / and of the repeated integrals of the square of the successive integrals of the complementary error function /jmin erfc n/. these functions often appear in problems leading to extended heat-conduction type of equations. a recurrence formula for jmin erfc n is established and formulae relating the functions in erfc /-dashn/ and jmjn erfc to available tabulated values of the functions in erfc /n/ are derived. the first three approximations to the blasius function and to its first two derivatives are also presented in tabulated form with four significant figures. test on the convergence of the series has been made by comparison with some exact solutions obtained by high speed computing machine. the comparison, extended to the physically essential quantities, shows that.. second and first derivatives. yield extremely accurate results. the errors in the first two derivatives of the blasius functions are always contained within less than one per cent.
