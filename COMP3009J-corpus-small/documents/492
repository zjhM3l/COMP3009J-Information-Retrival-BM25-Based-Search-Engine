prediction of ogive-forebody pressures at angles of attack. various approximations are being suggested for obtaining surface pressures on arbitrary bodies at angle of attack. this not presents a method for obtaining an approximate pressure distribution over the lower surface of an ogive forebody at angle of attack by utilizing the calculated pressures for zero angle of attack.
