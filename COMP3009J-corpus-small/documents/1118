elastic stability of orthotropic shells. a small-deflection theory for general instability of orthotropic circular cylindrical shells has been derived for external pressure, torsion, and axial compression. for the first two types of loading, comparison of the theory with experimental data for orthotropic cylinders reveals agreement comparable with that obtained for isotropic shells. for axial compression, experimental data have been found to agree reasonably well with theory for orthotropic cylinders, in contrast to the agreement usually obtained for isotropic cylinders.
