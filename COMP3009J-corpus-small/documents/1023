note on creep buckling of columns. a theory of creep buckling is presented in which the instantaneous elastic and plastic deformations following the application of a load, as well as the steady creep deformations, are considered in an approximate manner. equations are given from which the critical time, that is, the time elapsing between load application and the collapse of the column, can be computed.
