an investigation of wing-aileron flutter using ground launched rocket models. control surface flutter of the wing torsion-control rotation type has been investigated for an unswept wing with an under-massbalanced, half span, outboard aileron. thirteen pairs of wings were tested, using ground launched rocket driven vehicles, and a range of values of aileron natural frequency was covered. the test results showed considerable scatter, but enabled upper and lower limits of a flutter boundary to be determined approximately. it was established that aileron flutter could be eliminated on the models tested provided the aileron frequency exceeded the wing torsional frequency by 20 per cent or more. in this condition the models were also free from single degree of freedom flutter
