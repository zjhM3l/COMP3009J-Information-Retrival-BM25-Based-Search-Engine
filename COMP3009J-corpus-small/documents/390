some panel-flutter studies using piston theory. the use of piston theory was recently advocated for supersonic aeroelastic analyses, including the problem of panel flutter, and this has stimulated the investigation reported here. linear piston theory is mainly considered, but some effects of introducing higher order terms are discussed. flutter of rectangular simply supported panels and of elliptically shaped clamped-edge panels is considered, and some justification is provided for the use of /static/ aerodynamic forces and the neglect of aerodynamic damping. hence, it is concluded that ackeret loading gives more exact results than piston theory. solution of the flutter equations is made by applying galerkin's method to a rayleigh-type analysis using assumed modes of deformation.
