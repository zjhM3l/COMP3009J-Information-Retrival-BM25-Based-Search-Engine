turbulent heat transfer on blunt-nosed bodies in two-dimensional and general three-dimensional hypersonic flow. recent results obtained for three-dimensional laminar boundary layers are extended to the turbulent case. it is shown that in the presence of highly cooled surfaces and of moderate mach numbers of the outer stream, the crossflow and the pertaining reynolds stresses in a general three-dimensional turbulent boundary layer are negligible even for large transverse pressure gradients. a correlation due to mager between two- dimensional compressible and incompressible turbulent boundary layers is extended to the problem in question. from a study of the transformation and of its implications, a rapid method for the analysis of the boundary-layer flow under the subject conditions is established. in the absence of general three- dimensional data, a comparison with experiments and with the predictions of other known analyses is carried out for several axisymmetric configurations,. the results of the method presented here exhibit good agreement with the data. the range of validity of the cold wall approximation for general three-dimensional problems is estimated qualitatively on the basis of recent measurements in laminar flow, the argument being that, for either zero or favorable streamwise pressure gradients, smaller three-dimensional effects are to be expected in a turbulent boundary layer, as compared to a laminar layer.
