joule heating in magnetohydrodynamic free-convection flows. the steady, fully developed, laminar, free-convection flow of an electrically conducting fluid between two fully submerged open-ended, constant-temperature vertical plates located in a constant, uniformly distributed, transverse magnetic field has been analyzed with the joule heating term retained in the energy equation. analytic results are obtained. such analytic results are useful in estimating the actual magnitude of the influence of joule heating as well as a qualitative description of the manner in which it alters the temperature and flow fields. the present result confirms the usual practice that the influence of joule heating is negligibly small.
