some structural and aerelastic considerations of high speed flight. the dominating factors in structural design of high-speed aircraft are thermal and aeroelastic in origin. the subject matter is concerned largely with a discussion of these factors and their interrelation with one another. a summary is presented of some of the analytical and experimental tools available to aeronautical engineers to meet the demands of high-speed flight upon aircraft structures. the state of the art with respect to heat transfer from the boundary layer into the structure, modes of failure under combined load as well as thermal inputs and acrothermoelasticity is discussed. methods of attacking and alleviating structural and aeroelastic problems of high-speed flight are summarized. finally, some avenues of fundamental research are suggested.
