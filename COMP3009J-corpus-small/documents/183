properties of impact pressure probes in free molecule flow. an expression has been derived for the mass flow through a circular tube in free molecule flow when the tube and gas are in relative motion. the gas entering the tube is assumed to have a maxwellian distribution function and the molecular reflection process at the wall is assumed to be diffuse. the theory has been used to determine the pressure read by an impact probe in free molecule flow. although the general expressions derived apply to any value of gas velocity and tube size, the detailed calculations for the pressure probe are difficult except for the case of low speeds and long tubes. an experimental check of the theory has been carried out using impact probes in a whirling arm apparatus and in the utia low density wind tunnel. agreement between theory and experiment is quite satisfactory.
