on magnetohydrodynamic shock waves. in the earlier attempts at finding the jump conditions across a hydromagnetic shock wave (1, 2, 3) various simplifying assumptions regarding the shape of the shock and the dimensions and the character of the motion are made. from that analysis it is possible to write down the jump conditions in a higher degree of generality (4). the shock conditions for magnetohydrodynamic flows can, however, be derived in their full generality with the help of the transport equation as used by thomas (5) in the derivation of shock conditions in conventional gas dynamics. the purposes of this paper are.. cover the present more general case. that every flow and field quantity downstream from the shock wave is expressible separately in terms of the known values of these quantities upstream from the shock wave. in this rearranged form of the equations, various effects of the shock wave can be easily read off. the shock conditions along the same lines as in conventional gas dynamics.
