theoretical damping in roll and rolling moment due to differential wing incidence for slender cruciform wings and wing-body combinations. a method of analysis based on slender-wing theory is developed to investigate the characteristics in roll of slender cruciform wings and wing-body combinations. the method makes use of the conformal mapping processes of classical hydrodynamics which transform the region outside a circle and the region outside an arbitrary arrangement of line segments intersecting at the origin. the method of analysis may be utilized to solve other slender cruciform wing-body problems involving arbitrarily assigned boundary conditions. in the present report, the application of the method has shown.. differential incidence of both pairs of opposite surfaces of the cruciform wing-body combinations are practically independent of the body-diameter-maximum-span ratio up to a value of this ratio of 0.3. arrangement is only 62 percent greater than that for a corresponding planar wing-body combination. dence of both pairs of the opposing surfaces of the cruciform wing-body arrangement, is only 52 percent greater than that for a corresponding planar wing-body combination. unit surface deflection) of the cruciform wing-body arrangement having four equally deflected panels is therefore 94 percent of the corresponding planar wing-body combination.
