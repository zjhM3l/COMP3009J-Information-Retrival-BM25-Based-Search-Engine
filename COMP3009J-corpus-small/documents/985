a rapid approximate method for the design of hub shroud profiles of centrifugal impellers of given blade shape. a rapid approximate method for the design of centrifugal compressors of given blade shape with compressible nonviscous flow characteristics has been developed using techniques based upon stream-filament theory. axial symmetry is assumed, but meridional-plane forces derived from tangential pressure gradients are included. the method was applied to the design of an impeller in order to determine the approximate maximum meridional streamline spacing that could be used. three numerical solutions for different streamline spacings were made using the same hub profile, blade shape, and prescribed velocity distribution along the hub. the shroud profiles obtained from the three solutions, which utilized 3, 5, and 9 stream-tubes, were negligibly different. the approximate computing time required was 15 hours per streamtube.
