plastic stability theory of thin shells. considerable interest is currently centered on the role of deformation and flow types of plasticity theories in the solution of stability problems. for thin flat plates, deformation theory combined with classical stability theory appears to yield results which are in substantially good agreement with test data. on the other hand, flow or incremental theories appear to require the introduction of initial imperfections in order to obtain a satisfactory degree of correlation with tests. thus, in view of the current state of development of plastic stability theory, it appears fruitful to exploit the mathematical simplicity inherent in deformation theory in the investigation of the plastic stability of thin shells. although there may be theoretical objections to deformation theories as a class, test data on flat plates do suggest the predictive value of the results obtained from this theory. in this paper, a set of equilibrium differential equations for the plastic buckling of thin shells of constant unequal radii is derived. this set of three equations applies to flat plates, cylinders, and spheres under any loading system leading to buckling. for particular problems such as buckling of cylinders under axial compression, torsion or lateral pressure, and spheres under external pressure, the set of equations can be reduced to a single eighth-order partial differential equation of the donnell type in terms of the radial displacement only. these donnell-type equations are used to obtain solutions for plastic buckling of spheres under external pressure and long and moderate length cylinders under lateral pressure or torsion loads. the limiting cases of a simply supported flat plate under compression or shear, represent the solutions for short cylinders under lateral pressure or torsion, respectively.
