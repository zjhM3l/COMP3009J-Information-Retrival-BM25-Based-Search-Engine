a guide to the use of the m. i. t. cone tables. the second and third volumes of the m.i.t. cone tables have been found to be unsatisfactory in two respects. they have been criticized because of their inconvenient tabulation and because the theory on which they are based is inadequate near the cone surface. the former is climinated by means of a coordinate transformation. empirical evidence is presented to show that the latter may be ignored in practice. the exact nature of certain numerical errors in the table is also pointed out.
