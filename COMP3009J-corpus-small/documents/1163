force-test investigation of the stability and control characteristics of a scale model of a tilt-wing vertical take-off and landing aircraft. a wind-tunnel investigation has been made to determine the aerodynamic characteristics of a scale model of a tilt-wing vertical- take-off-and-landing aircraft. the model had two 3-blade single-rotation propellers with hinged (flapping) blades mounted on the wing, which could be tilted from an incidence of 4 for forward flight to 86 for hovering flight. the investigation included measurements of both the longitudinal and lateral stability and control characteristics in both the normal forward flight and the transition ranges. tests in the forward-flight condition were made for several values of thrust coefficient, and tests in the transition condition were made at several values of wing incidence with the power varied to cover a range of flight conditions from forward-acceleration (or climb) conditions to deceleration (or descent) conditions the control effectiveness of the all-movable horizontal tail, the ailerons and the differential propeller pitch control was also determined. the data are presented without analysis.
