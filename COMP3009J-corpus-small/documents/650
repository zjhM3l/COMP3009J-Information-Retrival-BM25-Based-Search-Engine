some design problems of hovercraft. analysis of the influence various aerodynamic parameters have on the performance of a simple peripheral jet system. power weight ratio, lift drag ratio, and effect of jet angles and thickness are each considered. structural requirements, optimum cushion pressure, and dynamic stability over waves are examined and then related to the economics of ground-effect machine operation.
