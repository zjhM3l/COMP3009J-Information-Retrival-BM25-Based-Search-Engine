propeller in yaw. it was realized as early as 1909 that a propeller in yaw develops a side force like that of a fin. in 1917, r. g. harris expressed this force in terms of the torque coefficient for the unyawed propeller. of several attempts to express the side force directly in terms of the shape of the blades, however, none has been completely satisfactory. an analysis that incorporates induction effects not adequately covered in previous work and that gives good agreement with experiment over a wide range of operating conditions is presented herein. the present analysis shows that the fin analogy may be extended to the form of the side-force expression and that the effective fin area may be taken as the projected side area of the propeller. the effective aspect ratio is of the order of 8 and the appropriate dynamic pressure is roughly that at the propeller disk as augmented by the inflow. the variation of the inflow velocity, for a fixed-pitch propeller, accounts for most of the variation of side force with advance-diameter ratio v nd. the propeller forces due to an angular velocity of pitch are also analyzed and are shown to be very small for the pitching velocities that may actually be realized in maneuvers, with the exception of the spin. further conclusions are.. a dual-rotating propeller in yaw develops up to one-third more side force than a single-rotating propeller. a yawed single-rotating propeller experiences a pitching moment in addition to the side force. the pitching moment is of the order of the moment produced by a force equal to the side force, acting at the end of a lever arm equal to the propeller radius. this cross-coupling between pitch and yaw is small but possibly not negligible. the formulas for propellers in yaw derived herein (with the exception of the compressibility correction) and a series of charts of the side-force derivative calculated therefrom have been presented without derivation in an earlier report.
