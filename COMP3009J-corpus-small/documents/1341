investigation of wing flutter at transonic speeds for six systematically varied wing plan forms. an investigation of the effects of systematic variations in wing plan form on the flutter speed at mach numbers between 0.73 and 1.43 has been conducted in the 26-inch langley transonic blowdown tunnel. the angle of sweepback was varied from 0degree to 60degree on wings of aspect ratio 4, and the aspect ratio was varied from 2 to 6 on wings with experimental flutter speed and the reference flutter speed calculated on the basis of incompressible two-dimensional flow. this ratio, designated as the flutter-speed ratio, is plotted as a function of mach number for the various wings. it is found that the flutter-speed ratio increased rapidly past sonic speed for sweep angles of 45degree and less, indicating a favorable effect of mach number. for sweepback of mach number range of the tests. reducing the aspect ratio had a favorable effect on the flutter-speed ratio which was of the order of 100 percent higher for the aspect-ratio-2 wing than for the aspect-ratio-6 wing. this percentage difference was nearly constant throughout the mach number range, indicating that the effect of mach number was about the same for all aspect ratios tested.
