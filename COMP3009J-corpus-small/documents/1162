force-test investigation of the stability and control characteristics of a 1/8 scale model of a tilt-wing vertical take-off and landing airplane. a force-test investigation has been made to determine the aerodynamic characteristics of a scale model of a tilt-wing vertical-take-off-and-landing airplane in the short- and long-wing configurations. the model had two 6-blade dual-rotating propellers that were not interconnected mounted on a wing that could be tilted up to an incidence angle of about 90 for vertical take-off and landing. the investigation included measurements of both the longitudinal and lateral stability and control characteristics in the normal- forward-flight, transition, and hovering ranges. tests in the forward-flight and transition conditions were made at various wing incidences and power conditions. tests in the hovering condition were made in the presence of the ground. the data are presented without analysis.
