two-dimensional jet mixing of a compressible fluid. the mixing and divergence of a supersonic jet exhausting into a supersonic stream are investigated theoretically. in the first part of this paper, the flow is assumed to be laminar. when the velocity and temperature in the jet are different slightly from those of the surrounding stream, by the method of small perturbations and under ordinary boundary layer assumptions, the equation of motion of two-dimensional flow will be reduced to a form of the well-known equation of heat conduction, whose solution is known for any given boundary conditions. it has also been shown that the exact solution of the two dimensional jet mixing of viscous compressible fluids can be obtained by successive approximations starting with the solution of small perturbations. velocity and temperature distributions for two cases--one is the mixing of two-uniform flows and the other is the mixing of a jet of compressible fluid from a two-dimensional nozzle with full expansion exhausting into a supersonic stream--have been calculated. the properties of the jet mixing depend mainly on the momentum of the jet regardless of whether the change of momentum is due to the change of velocity or the change of temperature--i.e., the change of density. compressibility has a considerable effect on the properties of the jet. in the second part, the cases of turbulent flow are investigated. by means of reichardt's theory of free turbulence, the turbulent shearing stress may be expressed as it has been shown in this paper that where is a constant that can be determined experimentally. the value of n lies between 0 and 1. the exact value of n depends on the condition of mixing. when the expression of turbulent shearing stress given above is used instead of the viscous stress in the equation of motion, by suitable transformation of variables, it has been shown that the equation of two-dimensional turbulent jet mixing is identical to that of the laminar case. hence, the solution of the first part of this paper can be applied to the turbulent case, provided that the characteristic constants and n have been properly chosen.
