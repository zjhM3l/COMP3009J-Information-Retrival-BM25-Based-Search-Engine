a study of second-order supersonic flow theory. an attempt is made to develop a second approximation to the solution of problems of supersonic flow which can be solved by existing first-order theory. the method of attack adopted is an iteration process using the linearized solution as the first step. for plane flow it is found that a particular integral of the iteration equation can be written down at once in terms of the first-order solution. the second-order problem is thereby reduced to an equivalent first-order problem and can be readily solved. at the surface of an isolated body, the solution reduces to the well-known result of busemann. the plane case is considered in some detail insofar as it gives insight into the nature of the iteration process. again, for axially symmetric flow the problem is reduced to a first-order problem by the discovery of a particular integral. for smooth bodies, the second-order solution can then be calculated by the method of von karman and moore. bodies with corners are also treated by a slight modification of the method. the second-order solution for cones represents a considerable improvement over the linearized result. second-order theory also agrees well with several solutions for other bodies of revolution calculated by the numerical method of characteristics. for full three-dimensional flow, only a partial particular integral has been found. as an example of a more general problem, the solution is derived for an inclined cone. the possibility of treating other inclined bodies of revolution and three-dimensional wings is discussed briefly.
