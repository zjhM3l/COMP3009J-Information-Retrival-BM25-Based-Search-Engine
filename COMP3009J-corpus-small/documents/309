on the motion of a flat plate at high speed in a viscous compressible fluid, ii, steady motion. the theory of the steady flow of a viscous compressible fluid past a flat plate at high mach number due to lees and probstein is extended by a more complete discussion of the flow in the inviscid layer between the shock wave and the boundary layer. it is shown that similar solutions exist in this layer, analogously to those found by li and nagamatsu in the boundary layer, and that the two may be joined to give, allowing one minor assumption, a full account of the flow. it is shown that the boundary-layer equations may be reduced to those for an incompressible fluid and that the von karman-pohlhausen method describes the flow in it with good accuracy. the tangent wedge approximation for the pressure on the plate, used by lees and his collaborators, is found to be in deficit by 10 per cent for air. finally, it is shown that the theory for weak interaction cannot be extended further without a complete knowledge of the flow.
