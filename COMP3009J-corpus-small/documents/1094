investigation of the effects of ground proximity and propeller position on the effectiveness of a wing with large chord slotted flaps in redirecting propeller slipstream downward for vertical take-off. an investigation of the effects of ground proximity and propeller position on the effectiveness of a wing equipped with large-chord slotted flaps in redirecting the slipstreams from large-diameter propellers downward for vertical take-off has been conducted in a static-thrust facility at the langley aeronautical laboratory. the results indicate that, with the propeller thrust axis on the wing chord plane, both the angle through which the slipstream is deflected and the ratio of resultant force to thrust are reduced as the ground is approached. at positions nearest the ground some of the loss in resultant force is regained. lowering the thrust axis below the wing chord plane reduces the adverse effects of the ground and also reduces the large diving moments associated with the slotted-flap arrangement. the static-thrust efficiency of the propellers is slightly reduced by the ground effect.
