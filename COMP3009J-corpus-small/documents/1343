formulas for the supersonic loading, lift and drag of flat swept back wings with leading edges behind the mach lines. the method of superposition of linearized conical flows has been applied to the calculation of the aerodynamic properties, in supersonic flight, of thin flat, swept-back wings at an angle of attack. the wings are assumed to have rectilinear plan forms, with tips parallel to the stream, and to taper in the conventional sense. the investigation covers the moderately supersonic speed range where the mach lines from the leading-edge apex lie ahead of the wing. the trailing edge may lie ahead of or behind the mach lines from its apex. the case in which the mach cone from one tip intersects the other tip is not treated. formulas are obtained for the load distribution, the total lift, and the drag due to lift. for the cases in which the trailing edge is outside the mach cone from its apex (supersonic trailing edge), the formulas are complete. for the wing with both leading and trailing edges behind their respective mach lines, a degree of approximation is necessary. it has been found possible to give practical formulas which permit the total lift and drag to be calculated to within 2 or 3 percent of the accurate linearized-theory value. the local lift can be determined accurately over most of the wing, but the trailing-edge-tip region is treated only approximately. charts of some of the functions derived are included to facilitate computing, and several examples are worked out in outline.
