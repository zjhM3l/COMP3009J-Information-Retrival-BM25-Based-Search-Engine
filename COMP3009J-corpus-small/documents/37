a new technique for investigating heat transfer and surface phenomena under hypersonic flow conditions. on the forebody of many practically interesting hypersonic vehicles, there is little interaction between the inviscid flow field and the boundary layer. therefore, inviscid flow theory can be used to determine, independent of surface phenomena, the physically interesting quantities such as shock shape, shock detachment distance, sonic line shape, and pressure distribution. furthermore, the pressure distribution so determined can then be used for the study of heat transfer, materials behavior, and other surface phenomena. thus, for these bodies, the prandtl boundary-layer concept can be utilized for the calculation of both the inviscid flow and the boundary-layer behavior. it is the purpose of this note to point out that this concept can also be applied experimentally in order to provide, in conjunction with a conventional hypersonic wind-tunnel air supply, a means for investigating hypersonic heat transfer and surface phenomena under conditions of flight reynolds numbers.
