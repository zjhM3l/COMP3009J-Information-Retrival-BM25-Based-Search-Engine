linearized flow of a dissociating gas. the equations for planar two-dimensional steady flow of an ideal dissociating gas are linearized, assuming small disturbances to a free stream in chemical equilibrium. as an example of their solution, the flow past a sharp corner in a supersonic stream is evaluated and the variations of flow properties in the relaxation zone are found. numerical illustrations are provided using an 'oxygen-like' ideal gas and comparisons made with a characteristics solution. the flow past a sharp corner can be studied in a conventional shock tube and it may be possible to verify the present theory experimentally. in particular it may prove feasible to use the results to obtain a measure of the reaction rates in the gas mixture.
