free-flight measurements of the dynamic longitudinal stability characteristics of a wind tunnel interference model (m=0.92 to 1. 35). the dynamic longitudinal-stability characteristics of a standard wind tunnel interference model have been investigated in free flight over a mach number range of 0.92 to 1.35. measurements of lift-curve slope and manoeuvre margin were obtained, and are compared with results from transonic-tunnel tests under low blockage conditions. the analysis was extended to obtain damping derivatives to allow comparison to be made with possible future dynamic tests in wind tunnels on the standard shape.
