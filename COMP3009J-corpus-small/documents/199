measurement of two dimensional derivatives on a wing-aileron-tab system. measurements have been made of the direct two-dimensional damping and stiffness derivatives for a in incompressible flow. corrections arising from the apparatus are discussed and reference is made to an attempt to measure the direct tab derivatives. the effects are shown of frequency parameter, amplitude of oscillation, reynolds number, aileron angle and position of transition on the wing. variation with frequency parameter is substantially the same as for vortex-sheet theory and variation of amplitude produces little change in both derivatives. at the lowest reynolds number there is little change in both derivatives with variation of aileron angle for the condition of natural transition, but at higher reynolds numbers the stiffness derivatives increase at. a forward movement of transition reduces the stiffness derivatives at the smaller aileron angles, but at, at the lowest reynolds number, an increase results. similar trends are observed for the damping derivatives above. comparison with vortex-sheet theory shows that the measured values of the stiffness and damping derivatives are approximately 0.6 of the theoretical values. measurements have been made of the direct tab derivatives and cross aileron-tab derivatives for a per cent aileron and 4 per cent (approx.) tab. in addition some measurements of the direct aileron derivatives have been made for comparison with earlier results together with a number of static derivatives for the wing and controls. the influence is shown of frequency parameter, reynolds number, position of transition, mean tab angle and sealing of the control hinge gaps. some tests have been made with the ailcron set at minus 8 deg and the tab at plus 12 deg for which condition the hinge moment on the aileron was zero. reasonable agreement with the values given by the /equivalent profile/ theory is shown for both direct damping derivatives and for the direct tab stiffness derivative. the direct aileron stiffness derivative shows some departure from the theoretical value when. at and the natural transition, comparison with the values given by flat-plate theory gives the following approximate factors, where suffix denotes the theoretical values..
