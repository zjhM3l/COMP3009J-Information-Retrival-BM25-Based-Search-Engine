effects of simulated rocket jet exhaust on stability and control of a research type airplane configuration at a mach number of 6. 86. an investigation has been undertaken in the langley 11-inch hypersonic tunnel at a free-stream mach number of 6.86 to determine the jet-interference effects at high jet-static-pressure ratios on the stability and control of a research-type airplane configuration. compressed-air tests with a jet exhausting from the base of the fuselage were conducted over a reynolds number range of 0.57 x 10 to and over a jet-static- pressure-ratio range of 0 to 1460. the results of these tests indicated that the operation of the jet induced a sizable separated-flow region over the vertical- and horizontal-tail surfaces which could be approximately duplicated at low angles of attack by use of metal jet-boundary simulators. the results of force tests, during which these metal jet-boundary simulators were used, indicated that this separated-flow region caused a large reduction in the longitudinal stability and control and a smaller reduction in the lateral and directional stability and control. by extending the divergent section of the nozzle and thus reducing the jet-static-pressure ratio, these losses were diminished.
