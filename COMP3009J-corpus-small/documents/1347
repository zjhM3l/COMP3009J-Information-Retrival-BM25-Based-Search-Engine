approximate analysis of atmospheric entry corridors and angles. a simple closed-form solution for the achievable corridor depths and entry angles as a function of g-load limit, entry velocity, and vehicle aerodynamics and thermodynamics is developed for two modes of vehicle operation, constant angle of attack and modulated angle of attack. for constant angle of attack, operation at maximum negative lift coefficient on the overshoot bound, and at an angle of attack between zero and that for maximum lift-drag ratio on the undershoot bound, gives the deepest corridor. for modulated angle of attack, operating at maximum negative lift coefficient on the overshoot bound and modulating the angle of attack from maximum positive lift coefficient to zero on the undershoot bound give the deepest corridor. the modulated angle of attack gives corridor depths two to four times larger than the fixed angle of attack. for both cases the corridor depth is increased by increasing maximum lift-drag ratio, increasing g limit, and decreasing entry velocity. consideration of hot-gas radiation places a limit on the maximum angle of attack for either mode of operation. if a maximum free-stream reynolds number limit must be placed on the vehicle to ensure a laminar boundary layer, the deep atmospheric penetrations associated with configurations with high lift-drag ratio may be ruled out. both of these thermodynamic considerations reduce the acceptable corridor depth below the value calculated from aerodynamic considerations alone.
