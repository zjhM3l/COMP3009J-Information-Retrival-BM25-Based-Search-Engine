theoretical and experimental investigation of thermal stresses in hypersonic aircraft wing structures. a simple and relatively accurate analytic approximation is developed to determine the temperature and thermal-stress distribution in aircraft wing structures. theoretical investigations show that the results of the existing thermal-stress theories which neglect the temperature gradient through the skin thickness may exceed, in the range of higher biot numbers, the true values by more than 30 percent. refined photothermoelastic experiments verify these results and add another significant conclusion. they indicate that thermal stresses in wing structures generated by a variable heat-transfer coefficient coincide with the theoretical predictions which are based on a constant heat-transfer coefficient, as long as the latter represents the arithmetic average over the heating cycle and the variation is in the order of 10 percent. however, even much greater variations in the order of 100 percent produce only relatively small differences.
