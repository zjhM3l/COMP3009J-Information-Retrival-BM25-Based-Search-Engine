on transition experiments at moderate supersonic speeds. studies of transition over a flat plate at mach number 1.76 were carried out using a hot-wire anemometer as one of the principal tools. the nature and measurements of free-stream disturbances at supersonic speeds are analyzed. the experimental results are interpreted in the light of present overall information on transition at supersonic speeds and conclusions as to further fruitful experiments are drawn.
