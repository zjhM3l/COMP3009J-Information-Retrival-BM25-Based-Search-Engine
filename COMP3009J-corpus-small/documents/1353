investigation of a two-step nozzle in the langley 11in. hypersonic tunnel. flow surveys have been made in the first of several nozzles to be investigated in the langley 11-inch hypersonic tunnel. the nozzle was designed by the method of characteristics for a mach number of 6.98. two step expanded the air in the horizontal plane to a mach number of 4.36 and the second in the vertical plane to a mach number of 6.98. the test results showed that, although a maximum mach number of about 6.5 was obtained, the flow in the test section was not sufficiently uniform for quantitative wind-tunnel test purposes. deviations from the design flow were traced to the presence of a thick boundary layer which developed in the first step along the parallel walls.
