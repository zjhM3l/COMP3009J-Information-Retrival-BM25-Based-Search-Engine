an analytic extension of the shock-expansion method. the problem is considered of calculating approximately the inviscid rotational flow field and pressure distribution about a smooth two-dimensional airfoil with sharp leading and trailing edges in a uniform supersonic or hypersonic stream. the assumption of a perfect gas is made, and the basic flow pattern for the analysis is taken to be given by the simple isentropic shock-expansion method with straight characteristics. an elementary characteristics treatment is discussed to show when the simple shock-expansion method should be satisfactory for computing the surface pressure distribution, and under what circumstances it may be expected to break down. by utilizing characteristic variables the isentropic shock-expansion method is then formulated analytically, and an analytic result is obtained for the shock shape corresponding to this zero-order approximation. in the special case where hypersonic similitude is applicable, that is, for slender bodies and high mach numbers, the shock-shape expression for large distances is found to reduce to the result previously given by mahony, which for weak shocks and slender bodies in turn reduces to the simple-wave result first given by friedrichs. employing the analytic form of the isentropic shock-expansion method as a zero-order approximation, an analytically consistent perturbation method is developed by expanding the dependent flow variables in the exact partial differential equations in powers of the reflection coefficient for simple waves interacting with an oblique shock. the scheme by its nature helps to define those regions in which shock expansion can be used, in addition to taking into account in a perturbation sense the factors neglected in simple shock-expansion theory, namely, the curvature and reflection of the mach waves and the correct boundary conditions at the shock wave. analytic solutions are obtained for the first-order corrections, including the surface pressure distribution. the necessary numerical computation of the integrals involved is considerably simpler than a direct application of the method of characteristics. to illustrate the method and its accuracy, the zero-order shock shape and first-order pressure distribution are calculated for a family of parabolic arc airfoils at an infinite free-stream mach number. these results are compared with rotational characteristic solutions where available, and the present method is found to be in excellent agreement.
