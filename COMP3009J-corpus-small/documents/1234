direct calculation of pressure distribution on blunt hypersonic nose shapes with sharp corners. the method of belotserkovskii for calculating hypersonic flow fields past a circular cylinder is extended to deal with axially-symmetric flow past sharp-cornered nose shapes, in particular, spherical segments and flat-headed cylinders. results on spheres are also included. in the present paper belotserkovskii's first approximation is considered, and comparison of calculated pressure distribution and shock shape with experimental results shows very good agreement.
