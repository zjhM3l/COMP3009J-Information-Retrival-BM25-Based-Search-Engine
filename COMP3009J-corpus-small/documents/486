similarity laws for aerothermoelastic testing. the similarity laws for aerothermoelastic testing are presented in the range. these are obtained by making nondimensional the appropriate governing equations of the individual external aerodynamic flow, heat conduction to the interior, and stress-deflection problems which make up the combined aerothermoelastic problem. for the general aerothermoelastic model, where the model is placed in a high-stagnation-temperature wind tunnel, similitude is shown to be very difficult to achieve for a scale ratio other than unity. the primary conflict occurs between the free-stream mach number reynolds number aeroelastic parameter heat conduction parameter and thermal expansion parameter. means of dealing with this basic conflict are presented. these include (1) looking at more specialized situations, such as the behavior of wing structures and of thin solid plate lifting surfaces, and panel flutter, where the aerothermoelastic similarity parameters assume less restrictive forms, (2) the use of /incomplete aerothermoelastic/ testing in which the pressure and/or heating rates are estimated in advance and applied artificially to the model, and (3) the use of /restricted purpose/ models investigating separately one or another facet of the complete aerothermoelastic problem. some numerical examples of modeling for the general aerothermoelastic case as well as for the specialized situations mentioned in (1) above are given. finally, extension of the aerothermoelastic similarity laws to higher speeds and temperatures is discussed.
