hypersonic strong viscous interaction on a flat plate with surface mass transfer. the present report gives an account of the development of an approximate theory to the problem of hypersonic strong viscous interaction on a flat plate with mass-transfer at the plate surface. the disturbance flow region is divided into inviscid and viscous flow regions. the hypersonic small perturbation theory is applied to the solution of the inviscid flow region. the method of similar solutions of compressible laminar boundary layer equations is applied to the treatment of the viscous flow region. the law of surface mass-transfer for similar solutions is derived. the pressure and the normal velocity are matched between the inviscid and viscous flow solutions. formulas for induced surface pressure, boundary layer thickness, skin friction coefficient, and heat transfer coefficient are obtained. numerical results and their significance are discussed. future improvements are indicated.
