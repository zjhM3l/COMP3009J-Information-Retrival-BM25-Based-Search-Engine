aircraft flutter. the term flutter is used here to denote maintained or violent oscillations of a structure due to aerodynamic forces acting in conjunction with both elastic and inertial forces. attention is restricted to this particular branch of the more general field of aeroelasticity, which embraces buffeting, divergence, and reversal of control, as well as flutter,. airscrew flutter is not specifically considered. the monograph is divided into three main parts, each of which has been made self-contained for the convenience of readers. in the first part, general methods for the investigation of aircraft flutter, by theoretical analysis and by experiments on flutter models, are set out and discussed. a detailed account of the aerodynamic theory of wings in non-uniform motion is not included, since this has already been provided elsewhere, but methods for the evaluation of the aerodynamic forces required in a theoretical flutter analysis are logically developed, and a bibliography of researches on the aerodynamic theory is given in the appendix. investigations on specific types of aircraft flutter--namely wing flutter, control surface flutter, and tab flutter--are discussed in part these various types of flutter are considered, but the practical details of flutter-prevention devices are omitted. finally, in part 3, methods for the experimental determination of airloads on oscillating aerofoil systems are described, and available airload measurements are analysed and compared with theoretical results. an attempt has been made to refer in the text to all relevant british work reported by the early part of 1947. foreign work has been mentioned in parts 1 and 2 only where necessary for the sake of completeness, but in part 3 and the appendix all relevant foreign references known to the author have been included. matrix notation has been used for the theoretical treatment in part 1, but otherwise its use has been avoided.
