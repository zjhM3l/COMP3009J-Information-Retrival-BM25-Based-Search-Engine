analysis of quartz and teflon shields for a particular re-entry mission. the transient performance of ablation type heat protection shields is treated herein for the surface of a vehicle returning from outer space to the earth. the vehicle weighs 8640 kg, has a ballistic factor of 500 lb ft, re-enters with a speed of 11 km sec at ratio of 0.5, and is subjected to a maximum deceleration of 7.7 times the gravity constant. by use of well known equations for the heat transfer and the mass transfer at a heated surface, a numerical calculation method is derived which, for the investigated ablation processes, yields exact transient solutions of the fundamental system of partial differential equations. the method is applied to various quartz shields and to one teflon shield, which all evaporate so readily under the conditions of the problem at hand that practically no flow of molten shield material exists. the solutions also show comparatively small temperature changes parallel to the surface. the results show that the nose of the vehicle is cooled predominantly by the evaporation of the quartz or the teflon,. the rest of the vehicle's surface is cooled by radiation of the quartz or evaporation of the teflon. the large mass transfer effects on the nose of the vehicle are detrimental since the resulting low surface temperatures prevent the radiative heat transfer out of the shield, which does not involve any mass loss, from being the desirable governing cooling factor.
