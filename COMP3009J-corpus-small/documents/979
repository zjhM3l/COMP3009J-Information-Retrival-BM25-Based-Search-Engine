correlation of base pressure and wake structure of sharp and blunt-nose cones with reynolds number based on boundary layer momentum thickness. it has been established in the past that there is a certain relationship between base pressure and boundary-layer behavior. the base-pressure and wake-flow conditions were found to be dependent upon the local flow characteristics at the surface of supersonic vehicles directly upstream of the base or of the region of wake-flow separation. in order to use existing data on cones and other shapes to predict wake angle and base pressure on blunt bodies, an attempt was made recently at the naval ordnance laboratory to establish a unique relationship between given local flow conditions at the downstream end of sharp and blunt cones at supersonic speeds and the corresponding wake-flow conditions with zero heat transfer.
