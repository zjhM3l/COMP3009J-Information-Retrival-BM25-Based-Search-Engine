an extension of donnell's equation for a circular cylindrical shell. in 1933, donnell succeeded in simplifying the equations of equilibrium for a circular cylindrical shell he obtained simple relations between the critical buckling shearing stress and the physical properties of a thin circular cylinder under pure torsion. his approach reduces the tedious computations involved in the classical solutions and is still in good agreement with them. furthermore, it is easy to show that the well-known classical solution for critical compressive stress of the cylinder under axial compression can readily be obtained from donnell's equation.
