estimation forces and moments due to rolling for several slender tail configurations at supersonic speeds. the velocity potentials, span loadings, and corresponding force and moment derivatives have been theoretically evaluated for a number of slender-tail arrangements performing a steady rolling motion at supersonic speeds. the method of analysis is based upon an application of conformal-transformation techniques. the utilization of these techniques allows the simple determination of the complex potentials for various types of two-dimensional boundary-value problems. in addition, two simple and often-used approximations to the rolling derivatives have been compared with the corresponding exact values determined by the method presented in this report. in order to show the importance of wing-tail interference, the effect of the flow field behind a rolling wing on the tail characteristics has been illustrated for a simple wing-tail arrangement.
