on the use of side-jets as control devices. wind tunnel experiments with side-jets, issuing laterally near the base of slender bodies in a supersonic stream, have suggested the existence of a sizable and usable interaction. with this interaction force, the use of jet reaction controls may be as attractive for flight within the atmosphere as it obviously is for flight outside the atmosphere. this note indicates the altitude regime of interest and the order of magnitude of the interaction bonus for a lateral control jet located near the base of a body of revolution.
