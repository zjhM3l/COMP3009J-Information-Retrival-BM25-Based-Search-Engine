a theoretical analysis of heat transfer in regions of separated flow. the flow field analyzed consists of a thin, constant pressure viscous mixing layer separated from a solid surface by an enclosed region of low-velocity air (/dead air/). the law of conservation of energy is employed to relate calculated conditions within the separated mixing layer to the rate of heat transfer at the solid surface. this physical speed is app ied to alminar separations in compressible flow for various prandtl numbers, including consideration of the case where air is injected into the separated region..A application to turbulent separations is made for a prandtl number of.B unity in low-speed flow without injection. all calculations are for the case of zero boundary-layer thickness at the position of separation. for alminar separations the differential equations for viscous flow at arbitrary mach number are solved for the enthalpy and velocity profiles within the thin layer where mixing with dead air takes place. results are presented in tabular form for prandtl numbers between 0.1 and 10. the rate of heat transfer to a separated laminar region in air laminar boundary layer having the same constant pressure. injection of gas into the separated region is calculated to have a powerful effect in reducing the rate of heat transfn to the wall. it is calculated that a moderate quantity of gas injection reduces to zero the heat transfer in a laminar separated flow.
