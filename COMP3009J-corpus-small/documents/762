allowable axial loads and bending moments for inelastic structures under nonuniform temperature distribution. a strain-analysis method is derived and demonstrated for the calculation of design allowable load-strain curves for the cross section of a structure supporting axial loads and bending moments. the temperature effects of thermal stresses and changed material properties and all inelastic effects are included in the calculations so that the final curve is a design curve for the applied stresses as calculated by room-temperature elastic procedures. the method allows for sequence application and removal of load and temperature, as well as cycling of load and/or temperature. applications are shown for a rectangular bar under temperature cycling with axial loads and/or bending moments and for a box beam with one bending-moment temperature cycle. interaction curves beyween axial load and bending moment with inelastic effects included are given, the calculations being done on a digital computer. a procedure is given for using the method to construct design curves.
