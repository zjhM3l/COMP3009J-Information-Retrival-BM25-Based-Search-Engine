simplified formulas for boundary value problems of the thin-- walled circular cylinder. n. j. hoff has presented formulas which can be used in the solution of boundary-value problems of circular cylinders. the purpose of this note is to express these results in exact simplified form,. a more detailed investigation appears elsewhere. the notation will be that of hoff unless otherwise stated.
