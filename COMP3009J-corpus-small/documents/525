on hypersonic viscous flow over an insulated flat plate with surface mass transfer. hypersonic viscous flow over an insulated flat plate with surface mass transfer is studied. the tangent-wedge approximation is used in the inviscid-flow region, and the integral method is applied to the treatment of the laminar boundary layer. the law of surface mass transfer for the present analysis is derived. a continuous transition of the pressure variation is achieved from the strong to the weak pressure-interaction region. first-order formulas for the induced surface pressure and the skin-friction coefficient are obtained for both the strong and weak pressure-interaction regions. results are compared with those calculated from other analyses.
