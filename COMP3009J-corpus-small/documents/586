an approximate treatment of unsteady heat conduction in semi-infinite solids with variable thermal properties. this very short paper presents an approximate procedure for the calculation of unsteady heat conduction in semi-infinite solids with variable thermal properties. it is claimed to be an improvement over previous efforts in this area since it yields physically sensible results for cases where thermal properties have a large dependence on temperature. instead of using polynomials to represent an unsteady temperature profile an exponential form is used. good agreement is shown for several cases where the method of the paper is compared with exact solutions.
