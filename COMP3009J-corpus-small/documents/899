aerodynamic effects on boundary layer unsteadiness. with a view to the study of aerodynamic problems, a review is made of boundary layer theory for a flat plate moving with a time-dependent velocity. unsteady effects are shown to enter according to the magnitude of the ratio of time for diffusion to act throughout the boundary layer to the characteristic time of the imposed unsteadiness. it is concluded that a boundary layer may be considered quasi-steady even during extreme flight manocuvres. generation of acoustic noise purely by boundary layer unsteadiness is generally small. thermal and heat-transfer effects are cited. unsteady boundary layer considerations are important in damping or amplifying certain instabilities, such as flutter of panels and stalling flutter of aerofoils. in connection with the aerofoil problem, laminar separation concepts and the stagnation-point boundary layer are described for unsteady flow. an analysis of aerofoil lift hysteresis is described, using unsteady laminar boundary layer considerations, which leads to a prediction of counter-clockwise hysteresis at maximum lift.
