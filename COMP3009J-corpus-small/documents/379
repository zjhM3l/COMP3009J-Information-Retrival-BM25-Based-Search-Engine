reverse flow and variational theorems for lifting surfaces in nonstationary compressible flow. a reverse-flow theorem for compressible nonsteady flow, valid within the limits of linearized theory, is derived. this theorem gives a general class of relations between linearized solutions for lifting surfaces in direct and reverse flow. based on the same considerations used to establish the theorem, an adjoint variational principle, which may be useful in approximate solutions of non-steady lifting surface problems, is obtained. to illustrate the uses of the reverse-flow theorem, it is applied to the determination of relations between aerodynamic coefficients in direct and reverse flow and to the obtaining of influence functions for total lift, pitching moment, and rolling moment for a wing oscillating with arbitrary motion and surface deformation, in terms of the pressure distributions for simpler cases in reverse flow.
