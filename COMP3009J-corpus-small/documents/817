loading paths and the incremental stress law. this paper will be concerned with some properties of the stress-strain law for work hardening materials introduced by w. prager incremental strain or plastic flow law by which it is meant that the differentials of strain are expressed as functions of the stresses, strains, and differentials of the stress. we shall also have occasion to refer to total strain or plastic deformation laws, in which the strains are given directly as functions of the stress.
