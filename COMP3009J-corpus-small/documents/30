photo-thermoelastic investigation of transient thermal stresses in a multiweb wing structure. photothermoelastic experiments were performed on a long multiweb wing model for which a theoretical analysis is available in the literature. the experimental procedures utilized to simulate the conditions prescribed in the theory are fully described. correlation of theory and experiment in terms of dimensionless temperature, stress, time, and biot number revealed that the theory predicted values higher than the experimentally observed maximum thermal stresses at the center of the web. detailed temperature measurements in the flange suggested that the major source of this discrepancy can be traced to the one-dimensional heat conduction analysis of the flange employed in the theory.
