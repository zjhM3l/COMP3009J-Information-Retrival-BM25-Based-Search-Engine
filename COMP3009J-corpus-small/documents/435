application of similar solutions to calculations of laminar heat transfer on bodies with yaw and large pressure gradients in high speed flow. an integral method for the rapid calculation of heat-transfer distributions on yawed cylinders of arbitrary cross-sectional shape and on bodies of revolution in high-speed flows is developed for laminar boundary layers. the method involves the quadrature of a function of the pressure distribution (assumed given) and satisfies the integral energy equation with the assumption of local similarity, wherein the actual boundary-layer profiles at every station are replaced by corresponding profiles from a family of similar solutions. the method is compared with other local similarity methods and with experimental heat-transfer data on a circular cylinder and on a body of revolution designed for large axial pressure gradients. good agreement between theory and data is obtained and it is shown that the present integral method, in both its complete and simplified form, gives generally better agreement with the data than certain other local similarity methods. numerical examples are presented showing that the effect of sweep and gas properties on heat-transfer distribution is small.
