viscous and inviscid nonequilibrium gas flows. the condition of immediate freezing of the mass fraction of dissociated species of air at the equilibrium value behind the shock envelope prevails over a major portion of the flight spectrum associated with lifting re-entry vehicles. this is observed by means of order-of-magnitude considerations within the limits of the present knowledge of chemical reaction rates for the constituents of air. accordingly, investigations of the viscous and inviscid hypersonic flow about blunt and sharp leading edge slender bodies are made. the investigations are generalized to consider an arbitrary degree of dissociation in the ambient free stream. this condition is included in order to allow comparison with the flow field about a model in the test section of a hypersonic facility with dissociated air species present in the free stream. inviscid frozen flow investigations are made for blunt and sharp leading edge slender body power-law geometries. the results indicate that the influence of a finite leading edge, in inducing a pressure field far downstream (/blast-wave/ analogy), is considerably diminished for this model. this conclusion is verified numerically by a characteristics solution for the hypersonic flow about a /sonic-wedge/ slab. the viscous investigations consider the boundary-layer interaction problem with a frozen degree of dissociation. in this case, as in the inviscid analysis, the governing parameter is observed to be the ratio of the dissociation energy to the free-stream kinetic energy. the influence of this parameter on the boundary-layer interaction mechanism for a highly cooled, noncatalytic wall is presented. the influence of a frozen flow field on skin friction and heat transfer is also discussed. finally, since higher mach number gas flows may be generated in wind tunnel nozzles where dissociation nonequilibrium effects are present, the possibility of employing expansions with a controlled degree of dissociation as a technique for aerodynamic simulation is presented.
