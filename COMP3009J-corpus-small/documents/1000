free-flight measurements of the static and dynamic stability and drag of a 10 blunted cone at mach numbers 3. 5 and 8.5. tests were made of a short blunt-nosed without a 50 half-angle conical afterbody in a pressurized ballistic range at nominal mach numbers of 3.5 and of 90,000 and 220,000, respectively. it was found that the models were statically stable about the center- of-gravity location tested but exhibited neutral dynamic stability for flight at constant altitude. the static stability was not affected by the but was nonlinear with angle of attack and varied with mach number. the nonlinear variation of the pitching moment with angle of attack was accurately approximated by a cubic polynomial. the static stability was only qualitatively predicted by modified newtonian theory. the drag characteristics were in good agreement with values calculated by use of modified newtonian theory. calculations of the oscillatory behavior of the configurations flying an example entry trajectory through the martian atmosphere indicated the configurations to be dynamically satisfactory. pitching motions should converge to a small fraction of the amplitude at entry, provided the initial angle of attack and pitch rate are not large enough to cause tumbling.
