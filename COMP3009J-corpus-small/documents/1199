theoretical investigations of a supersonic laminar boundary layer with foreign-gas injection. the phenomena arising from the uniform injection of helium, air, argon, and iodine into the laminar boundary layer of a supersonic stream of air in a tube were investigated theoretically. the partial differential equations describing the energy, mass, and momentum transfers through the boundary layer were obtained, and a series solution was found for the case of uniform injection through the tube wall. the results of the analysis are in the form of axial distributions of wall temperature and recovery factor and of radial distribution of concentration, velocity, static, and stagnation temperatures. the gas mixture was assumed to be a perfect gas. properties of the mixture were calculated in accordance with the gibbs-dalton rule and the mixing rules based on the kinetic theory of dilute gases. transport properties for pure air were taken from the n.b.s. tabulations. transport properties for the other gases were calculated by kinetic-theory methods, employing a lennard-jones 6-12 model for the interaction potential. the theoretical predictions for the recovery factor along the tube with air or argon injection agree with experimental data to within one percent. the theoretical predictions for helium injection indicate an 8-percent rise in the recovery factor along the tube, while experiments have shown only a 1-percent rise. these differences between theory and experiment are attributed to inaccuracies in the approximations to the transport properties of the binary mixtures.
