experiments with static tubes in a supersonic airstream. systematic tests have been made at a mach number of 1.6 on a family of static tubes. the variables which have been investigated are the shape of the nose, the distance of the holes downstream, and the inclination of the tube to the flow. pressure measurements have also been made in the vicinity of a shock wave and close to a wall.
