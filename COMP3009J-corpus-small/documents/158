temperature charts for induction and constant temperature heating. charts are presented for determining complete temperature historics in spheres, cylinders, and plates. it is shown that for values of the dimensionless time ratio x greater than 0.2 the heating equations reduce to such a simple form that for each shape two charts which give temperatures at any position within the heated or cooled bodies can be plotted. it is also shown that the usual simple heating and cooling charts can also be used for the determination of temperatures and heating times in bodies heated by a constant rate of heat generation at the surface (induction heating). finally, a two dimensional chart is given for finding heating times in short cylinders, thereby eliminating the trial-and-error solution that is necessary when heating times are found from the present one-dimensional charts.
