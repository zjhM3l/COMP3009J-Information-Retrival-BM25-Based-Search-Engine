the design of tubes under uniform external pressure on the basis of assumed inaccuracies. since the failure of tubes under uniform external pressure depends very much upon the various kinds of imperfections in them, it seems logical to derive a design formula for such tubes in which the quantities depending on imperfections will appear explicitly. the most common imperfection in tubes is an initial ellipticity, the limiting value of which in each type of tube is usually well-known from numerous inspection measurements. the deviation of the shape of the tube from a perfect circular form can be defined by the initial radial deflections w'.
