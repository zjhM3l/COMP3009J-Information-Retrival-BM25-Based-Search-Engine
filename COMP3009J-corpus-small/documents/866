regularities in creep and hot fatigue data. published experimental results are assembled to support a previously-given theory of uniaxial deformation, and the theory is then used to analyse published data on the creep-rupture and hot-fatigue of engineering materials. the theory enables data for different times and temperatures to be classed together, thereby providing information over a much greater range of times than could practicably be covered by experiments at a single temperature. an underlying numerical pattern common to all the widely different group 8 materials considered then shows through the experimental scatter. data for further engineering materials is considered in these terms in part 2.
