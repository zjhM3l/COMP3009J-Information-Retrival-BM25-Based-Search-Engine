calculation and compilation of the unsteady lift functions for a rigid wing subjected to sinusoidal gusts and to sinusoidal sinking oscillations. the total lift responses of wings to sinusoidal gusts and to sinusoidal vertical oscillations are calculated from the response to gust penetration and to a sudden change in sinking velocity through use of the well-established reciprocal relations for unsteady flow. the cases considered are two-dimensional wings in incompressible, subsonic compressible, sonic, and supersonic flow,. elliptical and rectangular wings in incompressible flow,. wide rectangular and delta wings in supersonic flow,. and delta wings of vanishingly low aspect ratio in incompressible and compressible flow. for most of the cases considered, closed-form expressions are given and the final results are presented in the form of plots of the square of the modulus of the lift coefficient for wings in a sinusoidally oscillating gust and in the form of the real and imaginary parts of the lift component for wings undergoing sinusoidal sinking oscillations. a summary table is presented as a guide to the scope and results of this paper,. this table contains the figure and equation numbers for the types of flow and plan forms considered.
