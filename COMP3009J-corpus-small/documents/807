ground measurements of the shock wave noise from supersonic bomber airplanes in the altitude range from 30,000 to 50,000 feet. shock-wave ground-pressure measurements have been made for supersonic bomber airplanes in the mach number range from 1.24 to 1.52, for altitudes from about 30,000 to 50,000 feet, and for a gross-weight range from about 83,000 to 120,000 pounds. the measured overpressures were generally higher than would be predicted by the theory which accounts only for volume effects. there is thus a suggestion that lift effects on sonic-boom intensity may be significant for this type of airplane for the altitude range of the present tests.
