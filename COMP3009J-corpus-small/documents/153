on the steady motion of viscous, incompressible fluids, with particular reference to a variation principle. except in exceptional cases, it is not possible to represent the motion of a viscous incompressible liquid by means of a variation principle, but all cases of such motion that have yet been discovered belong to this class of /exceptional cases./ the appropriate functions are given.
