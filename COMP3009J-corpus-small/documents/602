the 7 x 7 in. hypersonic wind tunnel at rae farnborough, part 1, design, instrumentation and flow visualization techniques. this is the first of three parts of the calibration report on the r.a.e. some details of the design and lay-out of the plant are given, together with the calculated performance figures, and the major components of the facility are briefly described. the instrumentation provided for the wind-tunnel is described in some detail, including the optical and other methods of flow visualization used in the tunnel. later parts will describe the calibration of the flow in the working-section, including temperature measurements. a discussion of the heater performance will also be included as well as the results of tests to determine starting and running pressure ratios, blockage effects, model starting loads, and humidity of the air flow.
