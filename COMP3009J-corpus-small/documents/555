closing reply to comments on generalized heat transfer formulas and graphs for nose cone re-entry into the atmosphere. in a recent paper (1), detra and hidalgo have shown that, when the boundary layer is turbulent, the heat flux per unit area at the sonic point of a nose cone may exceed the corresponding laminar heat flux per unit area at the stagnation point. the ratio of turbulent sonic-point to laminar stagnation-point heat flux per unit area has been estimated (2) to vary from about 1.0 to 10 for a hemispherical nose as the reynolds number (based on nose diameter) increases from 10 to 10. since for an axisymmetric body the surface area in the vicinity of the sonic point greatly exceeds the area in the vicinity of the stagnation point, the ratio of turbulent to laminar heat fluxes to the entire body will be much greater than the above quoted ratios of heat fluxes per unit area.
