numerical solution of the boundary layer equations without similarity assumptions. the crocco transformation combined with a mangler transformation is used to carry the boundary-layer problem for axially symmetric blunt bodies into a form suitable for direct numerical computation without introduction of similarity assumptions. conditions which in the original problem appear at infinity now are brought to a finite straight line, and the body is transformed to a parallel line. data can be generated on the stagnation line the equations are a parabolic system of two second-order equations, the boundary-value problem is analogous to the slab problem for the heat equation. an implicit difference equation is used to reduce stability difficulties. special techniques in forming the difference equation result in a linear system of algebraic equations to be solved on any given line of integration, and these solutions are computed from recursion relations generated by back substitution. for bluntnosed bodies with approach flow mach numbers greater than 8 (approximately), large temperature gradients occur across a thin boundary layer of dissociated gas, and it is necessary to use real-gas effects, approximated here by certain fits to the gas tables. a case is computed, however, for a lower mach number approach flow using perfect-gas theory to provide a standard against which similarity solutions may be tested.
