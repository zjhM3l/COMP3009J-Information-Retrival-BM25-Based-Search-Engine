on the mixing of two parallel streams. using the techniques of boundary-layer theory, the proper third boundary condition for the mixing of two parallel streams is derived from the compatibility condition of the higher order approximation. it is shown that the commonly adopted third boundary condition of balancing of transverse momentum is correct only for the mixing problem of two semi-infinite incompressible streams. for the fulfillment of the proper third boundary condition, the possibility of introducing the similar solution of blasius type is examined for various cases.
