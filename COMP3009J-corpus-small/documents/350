laminar jet mixing of two compressible fluids with heat release. the laminar jet mixing problems with heat release have been formulated. a general discussion of the solution of these problems is also given. the important parameters of these problems are brought out. some specific cases of the jet mixing problem, such as jet mixing of one compressible fluid, isothermal jet mixing of two compressible fluids, and isovel jet mixing of two compressible fluids with heat release, are discussed in detail.
