incompressible nonviscous blade-to-blade flow through a pump rotor with splitter vanes. the nonviscous flow through a mixed-flow pump impeller having one splitter vane between adjacent main blades has been analyzed on a blade-to-blade surface of revolution using a previously reported analysis method. solutions were obtained for a variety of flow conditions including several cases in which whirl is imparted to the flow upstream of the impeller. the velocity distributions on the main-blade surfaces and on the splitter-vane surfaces in the region of the splitter vane were strongly dependent on the assumed location of the rear stagnation points. solutions were obtained by assuming values of slip factor and of division of flow around the splitter in addition to assuming the location of the rear stagnation points. these solutions indicated that the velocity distributions in the splitter-vane region are largely determined by the division of flow around the splitter vane and that only the region in the immediate vicinity of the trailing edge is affected by the slip factor. blade surface velocities were obtained from two approximate methods by specifying flow division and slip factor, and these results are compared with the more exact solutions of the analysis.
