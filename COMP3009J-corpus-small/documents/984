method of analysis for compressible flow through mixed-flow centrifugal impellers of arbitrary design. a method is presented for analysis of the compressible flow between the hub and the shroud of mixed-flow impellers of arbitrary design. axial symmetry was assumed, but the forces in the meridional /hub to shroud/ plane, which are derived from tangential pressure gradients, were taken into account. the method was applied to an experimental mixed-flow impeller. the analysis of the flow in the meridional plane of the impeller showed that the rotational forces, the blade curvature, and the hub-shroud profile can introduce severe velocity gradients along the hub and the shroud surfaces. choked flow at the impeller inlet as determined by the analysis was verified by experimental results.
