leading edge attachment in transonic flow with laminar or turbulent boundary layers. the transonic flow round a two-dimensional airfoil at incidence is often determined by the type of flow in the leading-edge region. if the flow separates at the leading edge at low speeds it is liable to attach as the speed increases, often quite suddenly. a review of this change with laminar or with turbulent boundary layers re-emphasizes the importance of fixing transition when making model tests at transonic speeds in order to obtain flows closest to full-scale conditions. it is shown that similar airfoils with attached leading-edge flow show transonic similarity upstream of the terminal shock.
