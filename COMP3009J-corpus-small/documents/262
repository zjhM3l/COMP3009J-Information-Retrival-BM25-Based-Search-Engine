the formation of a blast wave by a very intense explosion. this paper was written early in 1941 and circulated to the civil defence research committee of the ministry of home security in june of that year. the present writer had been told that it might be possible to produce a bomb in which a very large amount of energy would be released by nuclear fission--the name atomic bomb had not then been used--and the work here described represents his first attempt to form an idea of what mechanical effects might be expected if such an explosion could occur. in the then common explosive bomb mechanical effects were produced by the sudden generation of a large amount of gas at a high temperature in a confined space. the practical question which required an answer was.. would similar effects be produced if energy could be released in a highly concentrated form unaccompanied by the generation of gas.qm this paper has now been declassified, and though it has been superseded by more complete calculations, it seems appropriate to publish it as it was first written, without alteration, except for the omission of a few lines, the addition of this summary, and a comparison with some more recent experimental work, so that the writings of later workers in this field may be appreciated. an ideal problem is here discussed. a finite amount of energy is suddenly released in an infinitely concentrated form. the motion and pressure of the surrounding air is calculated. it is found that a spherical shock wave is propagated outwards whose radius r is related to the time t since the explosion started by the equation where is the atmospheric density, e is the energy released and s a calculated function of, the ratio of the specific heats of air. the effect of the explosion is to force most of the air within the shock front into a thin shell just inside that front. as the front expands, the maximum pressure decreases till, at about 10 atm., the analysis ceases to be accurate. at 20 atm. 45 of the energy has been degraded into heat which is not available for doing work and used up in expanding against atmospheric pressure. this leads to the prediction that an atomic bomb would be only half as efficient, as a blast-producer, as a high explosive releasing the same amount of energy. in the ideal problem the maximum pressure is proportional to r, and comparison with the measured pressures near high explosives, in the range of radii where the two might be expected to be comparable, shows that these conclusions are borne out by experiment.
