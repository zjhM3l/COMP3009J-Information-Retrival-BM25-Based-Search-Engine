theory of mixing and chemical reaction in the opposed jet diffusion flame. an idealization of the flow system used by potter and butler is analyzed. the differential equation of mixing is solved exactly, to give the location of, and burning rate in, the flame. the solutions to the chemical kinetic differential equation are discussed, relations being derived between the jet flow rate at extinction, the chemical kinetic constants and the laminar flame speed in premixed gases. it is shown that the jet flow rate at extinction is independent of the transport properties. comparison is made with the experimental data of potter, heimel and butler. it is argued that experiments must be carried out at higher reynolds numbers if the measurements are to be quantitatively analyzable.
