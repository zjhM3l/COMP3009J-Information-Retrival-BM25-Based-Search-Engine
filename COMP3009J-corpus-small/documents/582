the melting of finite slabs. an approximate method, known as the heat-balance integral, is used to determine the melting rate of a finite slab which is initially at a uniform temperature below the melting point. the slab is acted upon by a constant heat input at one face and has its other face either insulated or kept at its initial temperature. the first three terms of series solutions in an intrinsically small parameter are obtained for the time histories of melting and the temperature distribution in the slab.
