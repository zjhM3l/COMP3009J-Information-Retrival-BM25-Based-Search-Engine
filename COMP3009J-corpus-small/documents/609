on three dimensional bodies of delta planform which can support plane attached shock waves. this note collects together in one report available theoretical work on bodies which can support attached plane shock waves, discusses some of the possible merits of such shapes, and includes some calculations illustrating their properties. also, some preliminary results from wind tunnel tests are given, together with details of proposed future tests.
