a theory of transonic aileron buzz, neglecting viscous effects. usaf-sponsored analysis of the unsteady perturbations of two-dimensional transonic flow around an airfoil, where local supersonic regions terminated by shock waves are present in the vicinity of the airfoil. viscous effects are neglected, and a linearized theory of the perturbations due to harmonic oscillations of an aileron is developed. a series solution for the pressure distribution is obtained, and numerical results for the nonsteady hinge moment, from the first approximation to the solution, are presented. as a result of flutter analysis a stability boundary for transonic aileron buzz is obtained. comparison of the theoretical results with experimental observations shows satisfactory agreement.
