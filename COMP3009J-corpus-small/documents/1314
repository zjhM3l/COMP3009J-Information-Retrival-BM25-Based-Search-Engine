production of high temperature gases in shock tubes. this paper is intended to set forth aerodynamic and thermodynamic calculations which are useful in the production of strong shock waves. the experimental production of strong shock waves is discussed. comparison of the experimental shock strengths with the theoretical calcualtions is made, and finally, some preliminary results of shock tube studies in high temperature gases (up to 18,000k) are briefly surveyed.
