modified cross-lees mixing theory for supersonic separated and reattaching flows. re-examination of the crocco-lees method has shown that the previous quantitative disagreement between theory and experiment in the region of flow up to separation was caused primarily by the improper c(k) relation assumed. a new c(k) correlation, based on low-speed theoretical and experimental data and on supersonic experimental results has been developed and found to be satisfactory for accurate calculation of two-dimensional, laminar, supersonic flows up to separation. a physical model which incorporates the concept of the /dividing/ streamline and the results of experiment. according to this physical model, viscous momentum transport is the essential mechanism in the zone between separation and the beginning of reattachment, while the reattachment process is, on the contrary, an essentially inviscid process. this physical model has been translated into crocco-lees languages using a semiempirical approach, and approximate c(k) and f(k) relations have been determined for the separated and reattaching regions. the results of this analysis have been applied to the problem of shockwave, laminar-boundary-layer interaction, and satisfactory a study of separated and reattaching regions of flow has led to quantitative agreement with experiment has been achieved.
