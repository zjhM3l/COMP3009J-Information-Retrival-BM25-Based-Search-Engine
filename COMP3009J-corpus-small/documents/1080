viscous flow round a sphere at low reynolds numbers. /l40/. relaxation methods are outlined, and the present problem formulated in modified spherical polar co-ordinates. the results of calculations made for r 5, 10, 20, 40 are presented in the form of stream function and vorticity distributions,. and further results of pressure distributions, velocity distributions, and drag coefficients, calculated from them. these results are shown to compare favourably with experimental work, showing a steady trend from symmetrical stokes's flow, towards boundary layer flow. the phenomenon of separation of the forward flow and development of a circulating wake, is explained and illustrated, the first formation of a wake being at r 17.
