normal-shock relations in magnetohydrodynamics. the magnetic-field vector is perpendicular to the flow direction,. thus for normal shocks there is no change of flow direction through the shock front. this class of shocks is included in investigations by several authors (five are referred to here), but the presentation here is thought to be especially convenient. all downstream quantities are given in terms of upstream flow conditions, including the upstream ratio of alfven speed to sound speed, and the shock strength (density ratio).
