pressure measurements at supersonic speeds on three uncambered conical wings of unit aspect ratio. pressure measurements were made at mach numbers between 1.3 and 2.8 over a range of incidences on three simple models representing thick conical uncambered wings with sharp leading edges. these tests form part of an investigation into the effects of thickness and camber on slender wings. the aspect ratio of the models was unity in each case, and the spanwise cross sections were bounded by.. the measured pressure distributions are presented, along with overall lift and drag (excluding skin friction and base drag) obtained by integration.
