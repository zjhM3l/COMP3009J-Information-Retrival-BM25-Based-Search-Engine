flutter tests of some simple models at a mach number of 7. 2 in helium flow. results of hypersonic flutter tests on some simple models are presented. the models had rectangular plan forms of panel aspect ratio 1.0, no sweepback, and bending-to-torsion frequency ratios of about. two airfoil sections were included in the tests ,. double wedges of 5-, 10-, and 15-percent thickness and flat plates with straight, parallel sides and beveled leading and trailing edges. the models were supported by a cantilevered shaft. the double-wedge wings were tested in helium at a mach number of 7.2. an effect of airfoil thickness on flutter speed was found, thicker wings requiring more stiffness to avoid flutter. a few tests in air at a mach number of 6.9 showed the same thickness effect and also indicated that tests in helium would predict conservative flutter boundaries in air. the data in air and helium seemed to be correlated by piston-theory calculations. piston-theory calculations agreed well with experiment for the thinner models but began to deviate as the thickness parameter approached and exceeded 1.0. a few tests on flat-plate models with various elastic-axis locations were made. piston-theory calculations would not satisfactorily predict the flutter of these models, probably because of their blunt leading edges.
