free-flight measurements of the static and dynamic. the real-gas hypersonic flow parameters for helium have been calculated for stagnation temperatures from 0 f to 600 f and stagnation pressures up to 6,000 pounds per square inch absolute. the results of these calculations are presented in the form of simple correction factors which must be applied to the tabulated ideal-gas parameters. it has been shown that the deviations from the ideal-gas law which exist at high pressures may cause a corresponding significant error in the hypersonic flow parameters when calculated as an ideal gas. for example, the ratio of the free-stream static to stagnation pressure as calculated from the thermodynamic properties of helium for a stagnation temperature of 80 f and pressure of 4,000 pounds per square inch absolute was found to be approximately 13 percent greater than that determined from the ideal-gas tabulation with a specific heat ratio of
