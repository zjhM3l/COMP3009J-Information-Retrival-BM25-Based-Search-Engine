exploratory tests of the effects of jet plumes on the flow over cone- cylinder flare bodies. schlieren photographs have been taken of the flow over cone-cylinder-flare bodies to study the extent of boundary-layer separation due to the presence of rocket jet plumes. tests were made of three cone-cylinder-flare configurations in the langley 11-inch hypersonic tunnel at a mach number of 9.65 and in the langley unitary plan wind tunnel at a mach number of 4.65 with two additional configurations. the stream reynolds number varied from approximately 317,000 to 582,000 based on model length. the conical flares had half-angles of 7 or 13 and contained one of two test nozzles with a design mach number of 3.72 or 4.53. the test nozzles were operated with compressed air and were designed to simulate a solid-propellant rocket motor operating at altitudes between to free-stream static-pressure ratio varied from jet off to 1,150 for the test nozzle with a design mach number of 3.72 and from jet off to mach number of 4.53. for most of the tests the angle-of-attack range was 0 to -4,. some additional tests were made at 2 and 4. measurements taken from flow pictures indicated that at zero angle of attack on all configurations tested with jet on the boundary layer separates ahead of the flare-cylinder juncture and the separation point moves toward the cone-cylinder juncture with an increase in pressure ratio. increasing angle of attack reduced the extent of boundary-layer separation on the windward side as did increasing the stream mach number from 4.65 to 9.65. other parameters which tended to reduce the extent of boundary-layer separation were.. number, (b) decreasing stream reynolds number, and (c) displacing nozzle exit rearward.
