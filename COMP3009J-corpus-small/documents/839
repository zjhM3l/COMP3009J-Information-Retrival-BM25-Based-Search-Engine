the bending stability of thin-- walled unstiffened circular cylinders including the effects of internal pressure. in a recent paper, the authors presented a statistical, semiempirical design procedure for the determination of the buckling strength of unpressurized and pressurized cylinders under axial compression. this procedure has been extended in the present paper to the bending of unpressurized and pressurized cylindrical shells and allows the calculation of the critical bending stress with a knowledge of the cylinder geometry and the internal pressure only. because no published data could be found, an extensive series of bending tests of pressurized cylinders has been performed. these new data for pressurized cylinders are treated semiempirically together with all of the other known test data for unpressurized cylinders. best-fit curves are presented using applicable theoretical parameters. design curves for determining the critical buckling stress for unpressurized and pressurized cylinders in bending are then developed as 90 per cent probability curves from the test data.
