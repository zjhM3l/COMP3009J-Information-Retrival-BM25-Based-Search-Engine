boundary layer displacement and leading edge bluntness effects in high temperature hypersonic flow. two important features of hypersonic flow over slender or thin bodies are the displacement effect of the boundary layer and the large down-stream influence of leading-edge bluntness. the present paper contributes new theoretical and experimental results on this problem. the interaction of the two effects is treated theoretically by extending the basic shock-layer concept. in the outer inviscid flow, a model consisting of a detached shock layer and an entropy layer is introduced to account for bluntness. in the boundary layer, the approximate solution is found to be governed by a local flat-plate similarity. under the assumption of a strong bow shock and a specific heat ratio close to unity, a theory is developed for an arbitrary thin body. for flat-plate afterbodies, the theory yields a solution agreeing with blast-wave theory at one limit and strong-interaction theory at the other. within the framework of the present theory, the problems involving angle of attack are also analyzed. complementary to the above study, a hypersonic similitude involving strong shocks, but not requiring close to one a natural comparison with experimental data correlated on the basis of this similitude. flat-plate experiments in air, conducted in the c.a.l. 11 x 15-dashin. hypersonic shock tunnel under cold-wall conditions, included measurement of surface heat-transfer distributions and schlieren studies for zero and nonzero angle of attack. steady laminar heat-transfer rates were measured by means of thin-film resistance thermometers at air test-flow mach numbers around 12, free-stream reynolds numbers from 1.4 x 10 to 1. for most of the experiments, airflow stagnation temperatures ranged from ratios of about 0.15. the range of test conditions at this stagnation temperature encompassed the limiting cases of dominant bluntness and dominant viscous-interaction effects. heat-transfer distributions were also measured on a sharp plate for air stagnation temperatures ranging from 2,000degreek up to 4,000degreek. the experimental data are quite well correlated in terms of the foregoing theoretical similitude variables characterizing combined effects of boundary-layer displacement and bluntness. the correlations obtained suggest that for the present experimental conditions, at least, the hypersonic viscous similitude is valid even with leading-edge bluntness in the paper, is generally fair.
