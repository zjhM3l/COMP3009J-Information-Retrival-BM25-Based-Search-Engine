a survey of buckling theory and experiment for circular conical shells of constant thickness. a survey of the state-of-the-art for the stability of thin-walled conical shells is presented. known theoretical results are summarized and compared with experiment. the shortcomings of present knowledge and recommended work for the future are discussed.
