a simple extension of southwell's method for determining the elastic general instability pressure of ring-stiffened cylinders subject to external hydrostatic pressure. a simple extension of southwell's method is presented whereby the elastic general instability pressure of ring-stiffened cylindrical shells subject to external hydrostatic pressure may be determined. an actual application of the method is illustrated in the paper and the results of several other examples are summarized.
