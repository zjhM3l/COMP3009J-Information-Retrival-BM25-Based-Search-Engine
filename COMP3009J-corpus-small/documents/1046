the bending strength of pressurized cylinders. a theoretical solution is given for the critical stress of thin-walled cylinders loaded in torsion. the results are presented in terms of a few simple formulas and curves which are applicable to a wide range of cylinder dimensions from very short cylinders of large radius to long cylinders of small radius. theoretical results are found to be in somewhat better agreement with experimental results than previous theoretical work for the same range of cylinder dimensions.
