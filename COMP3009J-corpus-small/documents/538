the conpressibility transformation and the turbulent boundary layer equations. the compressibility transformation first introduced by dorod-nitzyn has been applied in this paper to the equations of the turbulent boundary layer on a flat plate, considering heat transfer and arbitrary prandtl numbers. assuming the shear distribution to be invariant under the transformation, the stream function and the momentum equation take the proper form for incompressible flow, allowing the use of incompressible velocity profiles in the transformed coordinates. application of crocco's method to the transformed energy equation permits integration of the energy equation resulting in a formulism remarkably similar to that proposed by eckert. finally, the reference condition was chosen to correspond to the edge of the sublayer from considerations of the assumptions made regarding the shear-stress distribution. with this choice, the reference enthalpy is in good agreement with eckert's formula over the ordinary range of test conditions. in view of these results, the analysis may be considered to provide a theoretical basis for the reference-enthalpy method.
