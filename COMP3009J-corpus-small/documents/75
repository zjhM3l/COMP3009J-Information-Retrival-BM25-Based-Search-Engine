studies of structural failure due to acoustic loading. some discussion of the acoustic fatigue problem of aircraft structures is given along with data pertaining to the acoustic inputs from some powerplants in common use. comparisons are given for results of some fatigue tests of flat panels and cantilever beams exposed to both random- and discrete-type inputs. in this regard it appears that both the stress level of the test and the type of model are significant,. hence, no generalization can be made at this time. with regard to increasing the fatigue life, it was noted that increased stiffening of a panel due to curvature and pressure differential is particularly beneficial.
