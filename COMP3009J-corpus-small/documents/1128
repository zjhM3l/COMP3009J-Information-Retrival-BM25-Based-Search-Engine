face wrinkling and core strength in sandwich construction. the effect of initial waviness on the wrinkling of faces in sandwich construction is studied. formulae are derived to determine the failing stress when the faces wrinkle due to failure of the core in tension, compression or shear. the importance of core strength requirements in maintaining surface smoothness is noted. a comparison of theory with experiments is made, and the agreement between the two is found to be reasonably good. the strength of the core. williams has related the strength of the core in tension and shear to an arbitrarily assumed initial irregularity which, to ensure laminar flow in a wing is assumed to have a maximum admissible value (initial wave amplitude critical wavelength=0.0005 to 0.001).
