the viscous flow near a stagnation point when the external flow has uniform vorticity. in view of the recent controversy between li and glauert on the nature of the solution of the boundary-layer equations when the external flow is rotational, it seems worthwhile to draw attention to a certain exact solution of the navier-stokes equations which lends support to glauert's point of view.
