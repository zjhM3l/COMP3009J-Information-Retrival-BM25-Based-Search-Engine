laminar boundary layer oscillations and transition on a flat plate. this is an account of an investigation in which oscillations were discovered in the laminar boundary layer along a flat plate. these oscillations were found during the course of an experiment in which transition from laminar to turbulent flow was being studied on the plate as the turbulence in the wind stream was being reduced to unusually low values by means of damping screens. the first part of the paper deals with experimental methods and apparatus, measurements of turbulence and sound, and studies of transition. a description is then given of the manner in which oscillations were discovered and how they were found to be related to transition, and then how controlled oscillations were produced and studied in detail. the oscillations are shown to be the velocity variations accompanying a wave motion in the boundary layer, this wave motion having all the characteristics predicted by a stability theory based on the exponential growth of small disturbances. a review of this theory is given. the work is thus experimental confirmation of a mathematical theory of stability which had been in the process of development for a period of approximately 40 years, mainly by german investigators.
