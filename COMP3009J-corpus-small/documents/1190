flow of a gas near a solid surface. the state of a gas near a solid surface is investigated. it is assumed that at a sufficiently large distance from the surface the particle distribution function is of the chapman-enskog form. the half-range analysis previously employed for parallel plate geometrics (symmetric problems) can be adapted to the single-plate problem. although the mathematical analysis differs, the slip coefficients are essentially identical with those obtained from the parallel plate problem (e.g., couette flow). detailed calculations are presented for both hard sphere and maxwellian molecules. the recent work of bakanov and deryagin for hard sphere molecules, which is based on incorrect approximations, is discussed.
