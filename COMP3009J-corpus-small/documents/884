the estimation of fatigue damage on structural elements. a method is presented for the estimation of fatigue damage to aircraft structural elements. the gust spectrum to which the aircraft is subjected is analysed in terms of infinitesimal loading intervals. gust data supplied by j. taylor for flying below 15,000 ft are used to study fatigue damage in a number of aircraft structural joints and one whole structure.
