thermal buckling of clamped cylindrical shells. the problem of thermal buckling of shells arises in connection with air-frame bodies subject to aerodynamic heating at supersonic speeds. the case of the shell with clamped edges is presented, as this case typifies all structures with a tubular shell stiffened at intervals with stiffening rings. the shell is assumed to be unrestrained longitudinally and fully restrained laterally at the edges.
