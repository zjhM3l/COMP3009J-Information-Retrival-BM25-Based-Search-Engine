laminar boundary layers at the interface of co-current parallel streams. the approximate solution of keulegan(1) for the steady flow of a stream of viscous incompressible fluid over another at rest is extended to the case where both fluids are moving co-current but at different velocities. this solution utilizes a sextic polynomial for the velocity distribution in the boundary layers. the solutions depend only on the ratio of the velocities of the two streams and on the product of the corresponding viscosity and density ratios. numerical results are given for seven values of at one value of. lock(2) has published an exact solution with a numerical result for and the sextic polynomial solution is evaluated f40umerical result for and the sextic indicates that in general the sextic polynomial is more accurate than the quartic polynomial but that the advantage is not great.
