on similar solutions for strong blast waves and their application to steady hypersonic flow. the general solution of the strong blast wave is found in the newtonian approximation--i.e., neglecting terms of order the expressions obtained for the pressure, temperature, density, and velocity profiles are simple. the results are applied to power-law bodies in hypersonic flow using the equivalence principle. higher-order approximations for strong blast waves are investigated for the cases in which the shock layer is thin. a simple pressure formula is found, which constitutes an improvement upon the newton-busemann formula, and some of its applications are shown.
