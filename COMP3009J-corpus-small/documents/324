vorticity effect on the stagnation point flow of a viscous incompressible fluid. the effect of vorticity on axisymmetric stagnation point boundary layer calculations is investigated by calculating a perturbation to the stagnation point flow. the shear caused by the vorticity effect is found to be surprisingly large,.the slope of the shear curve /at zero vorticity/ as calculated by kemp agrees perfectly with the value deduced in this note.
