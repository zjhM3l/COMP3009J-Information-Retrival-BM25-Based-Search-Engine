nose drag in free-molecule flow and its minimization. the superaerodynamic nose drag of a body in a free-molecule flow involves two parameters.. the speed ratio s between ordered and random molecular motions (modified mach number), and the temperature ratio between the solid surface and undisturbed gas. simplifications of the drag formula are obtained at hypersonic as well as low-subsonic extremes. to minimize the drag on a nose of specified length and base radius, the ordinary method of calculus of variation was found inadequate. a generalized approach has, accordingly, been developed, and the specification of end conditions is discussed at length. results of the present investigation indicate that in all cases an optimum nose requires a flat tip. the optimum nose curve for the hypersonic extreme does not depend on the temperature ratio, but that for the low-subsonic extreme varies in the following manner.. for a hot body the curve is convex,. for a cold body, concave. an optimum solution exists in a restricted range of specification only. with prescribed tip and base radii the admissible nose length is bounded below for the cases of hypersonic and low-subsonic hot body and bounded above for the case of low-subsonic cold body. a vanishing tip radius leads to an infinitely long nose in the former and a vanishing nose in the latter case. optimum nose curves for several temperature ratios at the low-subsonic extreme, as well as the one for hypersonic extreme, are presented. it is observed that at the low-subsonic extreme, with, the hot-body solution asymptotically approaches the hypersonic solution--i.e., a slender conventional warhead with a flat tip,. whereas with, the cold-body solution asymptotically approaches the minimal-surface solution--i.e., tip radius, a flat disc.
