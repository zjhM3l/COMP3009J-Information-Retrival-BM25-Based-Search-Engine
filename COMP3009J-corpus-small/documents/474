laminar mixing of a compressible fluid. a theoretical investigation of the velocity profiles for laminar mixing of a high-velocity stream with a region of fluid at rest has been made assuming that the prandtl number is unity. a method which involves only quadratures is presented for calculating the velocity profile in the mixing layer for an arbitrary value of the free-stream mach number. detailed velocity profiles have been calculated for free-stream mach numbers of 0, 1, 2, 3, and 5. for each mach number, velocity profiles are presented for both a linear and a 0.76-power variation of viscosity with absolute temperature. the calculations for a linear variation are much simpler than those for a 0.76-power variation. it is shown that by selecting the constant of proportionality in the linear approximation such that it gives the correct value for the viscosity in the high-temperature part of the mixing layer, the resulting velocity profiles are in excellent agreement with those calculated by a 0.76-power variation.
