investigation of several blunt bodies to determine trans- onic aerodynamic characteristics including effects of spinning and of extendible afterbody flaps and some measurements of unsteady base pressures. several blunt bodies having shapes that may be suitable for atmospheric reentry vehicles were tested to determine the aerodynamic characteristics of such shapes for angles of attack up to 34. the tests were conducted through the transonic mach number range and at reynolds numbers from 1.74 x 10 to 2.78 x 10, based on body diameter. a full-skirted rather than a short-skirted type of shape developed the greatest amount of static stability and the largest lift-curve slopes. the angle of attack for maximum lift for such bodies appears to be subject to mach number effects. spinning a full-skirted body about its longitudinal axis generally increased the lift and reduced the pitching moment at angles of attack and reduced the aerodynamic static stability parameter through the transonic mach number range. the extension of segmented clamshell-shaped flaps from the afterbody of a short-skirted model served to increase the lift and static stability only if the flaps extended into the airstream. some evidence was found of oscillatory base pressures on two dissimilar shapes at certain high angles of attack and the highest mach number in these tests. there is doubt, however, that these pressures can induce any significant oscillatory motion for a reentry vehicle because of their small amplitude and phasing.
