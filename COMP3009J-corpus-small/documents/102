advantages and limitations of models. summary.. the use of models for structural test investigations in the presence of kinetic heating effects is examined. the principal features of the complex process to be represented are discussed under the classifications external air flow, internal heat transfer, elastic response. of these the second is found to influence most model design, and an analysis of a typical structure is included to illustrate the various contributions to internal heat transfer.
