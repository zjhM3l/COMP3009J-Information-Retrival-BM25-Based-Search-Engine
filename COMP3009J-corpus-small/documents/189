experimental investigation of base pressure on blunt-trailing-edge wings of supersonic velocities. measurements of base pressure are presented for 29 blunt-trailing-edge wings having an aspect ratio of 3.0 and various airfoil profiles. the different profiles comprised thickness ratios between 0.05 and 0.10, boattail angles between --2.9 and 20, and ratios of trailing-edge thickness to airfoil thickness between 0.2 and 1.0. the tests were conducted at mach numbers of 1.25, 1.5, 2.0, and 3.1. for each mach number, the reynolds number and angle of attack were varied. the lowest reynolds number investigated was 0.2 x 10 and the highest was 3.5 x 10. measurements on each wing were obtained separately with turbulent flow and laminar flow in the boundary layer. span-wise surveys of the base pressure were conducted on several wings. the results with turbulent boundary-layer flow showed only small effects on base pressure of variations in reynolds number, airfoil profile shape, boattail angle, and angle of attack. the principal variable affecting the base pressure for turbulent flow was the mach number. at the highest mach number investigated (3.1), the ratio of boundary-layer thickness to trailing-edge thickness also affected the base pressure significantly. the results obtained with laminar boundary-layer flow to the trailing edge showed that the effect of reynolds number on base pressure was large. in all but a few exceptional cases the effects on base pressure of variations in angle of attack and in profile shape upstream of the base were appreciable though not large. the principal variable affecting the base pressure for laminar flow was the ratio of boundary-layer thickness to trailing-edge thickness. for a few exceptional cases involving laminar flow to the trailing edge, the effects on base pressure of variations in profile shape, boattail angle, and angle of attack were found to be unusually large. in such cases the variation of base pressure with angle of attack was discontinuous and exhibited a hysteresis. stroboscopic schlieren observations at a mach number of 1.5 indicated that these apparently special phenomena were associated with a vortex trail of relatively high frequency.
