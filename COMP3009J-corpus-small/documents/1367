a theoretical investigation of the effects of mach number, reynolds number, wall temperature and surface curvature on laminar separation in supersonic flow. laminar separation in supersonic flow is investigated by an extension of stratford's method. it is assumed that separation is of the usual practical type, taking place upstream of the shock wave or other agency provoking it. the results of the analysis agree well in most respects with experiment.
