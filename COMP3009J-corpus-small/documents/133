some effects of surface curvature on laminar boundary layer flow. the laminar flow of a viscous incompressible fluid over a two-dimensional curved surface is investigated for two cases, one in which the curvature is /large/ and the other in which it is cases are obtained as approximations from the exact equations of motion by an order-of-magnitude analysis. these equations are solved for flow over a particular surface with zero surface pressure gradient. in this analysis, the pressure gradient normal to the surface is included, and the outer boundary conditions are modified in accordance with the requirements of flow over a curved surface. the results indicate that for equal reynolds numbers, the stress on convex surfaces is less than the flat-plate value, while the stress on concave surfaces is greater than for a flat plate. the most important effect of surface curvature, for the cases considered, is the modification of the shape of the velocity profile near the /outer edge/ of the boundary layer. the requirement that a smooth transition exist between the viscous flow and the potential flow at the outer edge of the layer causes the profile to have a negative slope near the outer edge for convex surface curvature and a positive slope for concave surface curvature.
