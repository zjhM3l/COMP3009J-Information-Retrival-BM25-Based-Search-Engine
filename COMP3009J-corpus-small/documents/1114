steady and fluctuating pressures at transonic speeds on two space-vehicle payload shapes. steady and fluctuating pressures have been measured at mach numbers which were varied from 0.6 to 1.2 on two bodies of revolution typical of two space-vehicle payload shapes, the centaur and the able v. the results of the investigation showed that significant fluctuations of pressure occurred on both bodies between mach numbers of 0.75 and 1.00. the maximum fluctuations measured at any mach number and angle of attack occurred in the region of the normal shock wave as a result of shock-wave motion. large regions of unsteady pressure also occurred as a result of separation on the converging afterbody of the able-v model. the maximum pressure fluctuations occurring on the bodies increased with increasing angle of attack. for angles other than are indicated since pressure fluctuations were larger on the upper half of the bodies than on the lower half. no definite conclusions could be drawn regarding the form of the spectral densities of pressure fluctuations in the region of the shock wave. the spectral densities in regions of separation following the shock wave appeared flat except for some increase in energy level below due to slight model motions.
