laminar heat-transfer and pressure measurements at a mach number of 6 on sharp and blunt 15 half-angle cones at angles of attack up to 90. two circular conical configurations having 15 half-angles were tested in laminar boundary layer at a mach number of 6 and angles of attack up to 90. one cone had a sharp nose and a fineness ratio of blunted nose with a bluntness ratio of 0.1428 and a fineness ratio of 1.66. pressure measurements and schlieren pictures of the flow showed that near-conical flow existed up to an angle of attack of approximately near the base and the bow shock wave was considerably curved. comparison of the results with simply applied theories showed that on the stagnation line pressures may be predicted by newtonian theory, and heat transfer by local yawed-cylinder theory based on the yaw angle of the windward generator and the local radius of the cone. base effects increased the heat transfer in a region extending forward approximately circumferential pressure distributions were higher than the corresponding newtonian distribution and a better prediction was obtained by modifying the theory to match the pressure at 90 from the windward generator to that on the surface of the cone at an angle of attack of 0. circumferential heat-transfer distributions were predicted satisfactorily up to about 60 from the stagnation line by using lees' heat-flux distribution based on the newtonian pressure. the effects of nose bluntness at large angles of attack were very small in the region beyond two nose radii from the point of tangency.
