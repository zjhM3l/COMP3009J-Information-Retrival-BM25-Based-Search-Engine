departure from dissociation equilibrium in a hypersonic nozzle. the equations of motion for the flow of an ideal dissociating gas through a nearly conical nozzle have been solved numerically, assuming a simple equation for the rate of dissociation, and a number of different values of the rate constant. the results of these calculations suggest that deviations from dissociation equilibrium will occur in the nozzle if the rate constant lies within a very wide range of values. they also suggest that once such a deviation has begun the gas will very rapidly/freeze/, so that the dissociation fraction will remain almost constant if the flow is expanded further, or even if it passes through a constant area test section. an approximate method of solution, making use of this property of sudden/freezing/of the flow, has been developed and applied to the problem of estimating the deviations from equilibrium under a wide range of conditions. if all the assumptions made in this report are accepted, then lack of dissociation equilibrium may be expected in the working sections of hypersonic wind tunnels and hypersonic shock tubes. it is shown, however, that the flow behind a normal shock wave in such a wind tunnel will not be greatly affected by any freezing that may take place in the nozzle upstream of the shock wave. even so, the stand-off distance of a shock wave in front of a blunt model may be quite sensitive to deviations from equilibrium.
