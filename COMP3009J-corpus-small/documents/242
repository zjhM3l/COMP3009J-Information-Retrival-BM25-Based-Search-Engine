an approximate theory of base pressure in two dimensional flow at supersonic speeds. an approximate theory of the base pressure in two-dimensional flow at supersonic speeds is presented using asimplified representation of the flow and some of the findings of tollmien's work on turbulent mixing in incompressible flow. good qualitative predictions of the effects of a boundary layer, of bleed air and of boat-tailing are obtained.
