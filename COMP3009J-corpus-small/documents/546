measurements of aerodynamic heating on a 15 cone of graded wall thickness at a mach number of 6. 8. this note describes transient wall temperature measurements made on a in an airstream of mach number 6.8. the skin of the model was sufficiently thin to allow it to reach zero heat transfer conditions within a running time of one minute. in order to reduce effects of longitudinal heat conduction during a run the electroformed-nickel skin of the model was made with graded thickness, and as a result fairly uniform temperature distributions along the surface were obtained at all times in both the laminar and turbulent regions. values of heat transfer, calculated from the wall temperature-time histories using the thin-wall temperature are compared to theoretical estimates using the intermediate enthalpy method 10, 11.
