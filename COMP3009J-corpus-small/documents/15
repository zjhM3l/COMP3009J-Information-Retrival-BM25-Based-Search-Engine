on two-dimensional panel flutter. theory and experiments of the flutter of a buckled plate are discussed. it is shown that an increase in the initial deviation from flatness or a static pressure differential across the plate raises the critical value of the /reduced velocity./ the applicability of the galerkin method to the linearized problem of flutter of an unbuckled plate has been questioned by several authors. in this paper the flutter condition was formulated in the form of an integral equation and solved numerically by the method of iteration and the method of matrix approximations, thus avoiding the constraint of assumed modes. for a plate (with finite bending rigidity) the results confirm those given by the galerkin method. an approximate analysis of the limiting form and amplitude of the flutter motion for a buckled plate is presented.
