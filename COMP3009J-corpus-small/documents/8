measurements of the effect of two-dimensional and three-dimensional roughness elements on boundary layer transition. in his study of the effect of roughness on transition, h. l. dryden found, on the basis of available data, that the effect of a two-dimensional roughness element such as a /trip wire/ could be represented reasonably well in terms of a functional relation between and, where is the reynolds number of transition based on distance from the leading edge, is the height of the roughness element, and is the boundary-layer displacement thickness at the position of the element. at his suggestion some additional data were obtained, primarily to extend the range to higher values of, during the course of an investigation of transition on a flat plate conducted at the national bureau of standards. after the results on the two- dimensional roughness elements were obtained, it appeared to be desirable to see whether a row of three-dimensional roughness elements would behave in the same way.
