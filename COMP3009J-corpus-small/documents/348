turbulent boundary layer in compressible fluids. the continuity, momentum, and energy differential equations for turbulent flow of a compressible fluid are derived, and the apparent turbulent stresses and dissipation function are identified. a general formula for skin friction, including heat transfer to a flat plate, is developed for a thin turbulent boundary layer in compressible fluids with zero pressure gradient. curves are presented giving skin-friction coefficients and heat-transfer coefficients for air for various wall-to-free-stream temperature ratios and free-stream mach numbers. in the special case when the boundary layer is insulated, this general formula yields skin-friction coefficients higher than those given by the von karman wall-property compressible-fluid formula but lower than those given by the von karman incompressible-fluid formula. heat transfer from the boundary layer to the plate generally increases the friction and heat-transfer coefficients.
