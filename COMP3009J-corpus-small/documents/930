general theory of large deflections of thin shells with special applications to conical shells. a general theory is developed for the case of large deflections but with rotations of the elements negligible compared to unity. the derivation is carried out in tensor form and therefore any coordinate system on the surface of the shell can be used. the effect of initial imperfections is included. it is shown that for shells of negligible gaussian curvature (shallow shells and developable surfaces), the problem can be reduced to the solution of two fourth-order partial differential equations in a stress function and the deflection normal to the shell. for shells forming a surface of revolution the results are indicated in terms of the equation of the generating curve. the differential equations for the conical shell are then listed.
