a theoretical calculation of the laminar boundary layer around an elliptic cylinder and its comparison with experiment. the author, in conjunction with th. von karman, has recently given a new method of approximate integration of the prandtl boundary layer equations, which was developed in order to treat cases in which separation of a laminar boundary layer might be expected. the method was developed because some doubt was felt as to the accuracy with which the well-known pohlhausen analysis would describe conditions in the neighborhood of such a separation point. numerical calculations were carried out for certain cases involving theoretical simplifications, and very considerable discrepancies were found between the results of the new and pohlhausen methods. the method was also used in developing a theory for the maximum lift coefficient of certain classes of airfoils. this theory gave satisfactory agreement with experiment but no direct experimental check on the boundary layer analysis itself has been given up to the present.
