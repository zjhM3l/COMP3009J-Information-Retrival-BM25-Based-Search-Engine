the use of aerodynamic lift during entry into the earth's atmosphere. by employing aerodynamic lift during entry into the earth's atmosphere at either orbital or /escape/ velocity, the range of allowable entry angles for a prescribed peak deceleration is greatly increased, while the total heat energy transferred to the vehicle can be held to about the same value as for a nonlifting vehicle. only modest lift-drag ratios are required beyond peak g to prevent the deceleration from exceeding the peak value, or to prevent the vehicle from skipping out of the earth's atmosphere. thus, the difficult guidance and control problem is greatly alleviated,. in particular, for return from the moon or other planets the necessity for multiple-pass drag braking is eliminated.
