charts for equilibrium flow properties of air in hyper-velocity nozzles. for initial stagnation pressures up to 1,000 atmospheres and stagnation enthalpies up to 10,000 btu per pound, nozzle-flow properties for equilibrium air have been computed and plotted on charts. the work of nasa tn d-693 has been extended to include flow properties for closer intervals of specified stagnation enthalpies. properties which have been charted as a function of mach number are as follows.. temperature, pressure, density, velocity, area ratio, dynamic pressure, reynolds number, isentropic exponent, and molecular weight ratio. ratios of temperature, pressure, and density across normal shock waves are also charted, and weight-flow rate is plotted as a function of stagnation enthalpy.
