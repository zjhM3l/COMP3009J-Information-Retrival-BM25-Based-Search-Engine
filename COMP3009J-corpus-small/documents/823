plastic torsional buckling strength of cylinders including the effects of imperfections. the torsional buckling strength of a cylinder in the plastic range has been determined. an energy solution and a more exact solution, both based on a plastic stress-strain relationship given by the simple deformation theory, are presented. close agreement between the two solutions is found. the effects of large deflections and imperfections on buckling strength are analyzed. for two groups of experimental results used for comparison, the effects of geometrical imperfections in the plastic range are negligible. the theoretical results are found to be in good agreement with the experimental results.
