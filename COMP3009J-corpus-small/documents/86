inviscid-incompressible flow theory of static peripheral jets in proximity to the ground. an /exact/ flow theory of peripheral jets issuing symmetrically from a hovering aerial-ground vehicle is presented. the theory is exact insofar as no simplifying assumptions have been made in obtaining a solution of the governing inviscid, two-dimensional hydrodynamical flow equations. the results are valid for all jet thickness vehicle height ratios. the limit of applicability of existing theories (very low thickness height ratios) are defined. jet reaction, lift, and power coefficients for static conditions are introduced and computed. lift augmentation and lift power ratios are also calculated. applications to three-dimensional vehicles with rotational symmetry are indicated.
