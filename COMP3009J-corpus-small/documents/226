aerofoil theory of a flat delta wing at supersonic speeds. lift, drag, and pressure distribution of a triangular flat plate moving at a small incidence at supersonic speeds are given for arbitrary mach number and aspect ratio. the values obtained for lift and drag are compared with the corresponding values obtained by strip theory. the possibility of further applications of the analysis leading up to the above results is indicated.
