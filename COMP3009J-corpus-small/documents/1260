on the response of the laminar boundary layer to small fluctuations of the free-stream velocity. the linearized treatment of small time-dependent disturbances of a laminar boundary layer, initiated by lighthill, is extended in several ways. in particular, the high-frequency expansion is continued beyond the leading (stokes) term. several interesting questions of /joining/ occur, which are discussed but left unresolved. in addition, a practical method for obtaining the response to the laminar boundary layer to an impulsive change in velocity is presented. the methods are applied to the case in which the basic steady flow belongs to the falkner and skan family of similarity solutions.
