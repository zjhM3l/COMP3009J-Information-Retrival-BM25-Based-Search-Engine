stability equations for conical shells. the author rewrites v. s. vlasov's equations for (linear) stability theory of shells (prikl. mat. meh. 8(1944), 109-placements. the result is a single eighth-order equation for normal deflection, and two fourth-order equations relating the displacement components in the shell middle surface to the normal displacement.
