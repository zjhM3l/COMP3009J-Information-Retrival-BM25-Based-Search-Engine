some possibilities of using gas mixtures other than in aerodynamic research. a study is made of the advantages that can be realized in compressible-flow research by employing a substitute heavy gas in place of air. most heavy gases considered in previous investigations are either toxic, chemically active, or (as in the case of the freons) have a ratio of specific heats greatly different from air. the present report is based on the idea that by properly mixing a heavy monatomic gas with a suitable heavy polyatomic gas, it is possible to obtain a heavy gas mixture which has the correct ratio of specific heats and which is nontoxic, nonflammable, thermally stable, chemically inert, and comprised of commercially available components. calculations were made of wind-tunnel characteristics for 63 gas pairs comprising 21 different polyatomic gases properly mixed with each of three monatomic gases (argon, krypton, and xenon). for a given mach number, reynolds number, and tunnel pressure, a gas-mixture wind tunnel having the same specific-heat ratio as air would be appreciably smaller and would require much less power than a corresponding air wind tunnel. analogous though different advantages can be realized in compressor research and in firing-range research. the most significant applications, perhaps, arise through selecting and proportioning a gas mixture so as to have at ordinary wind-tunnel temperatures certain dimensionless characteristics which air at flight temperatures possesses but which air at ordinary wind-tunnel temperatures does not possess. characteristics which involve the relaxation time (or bulk viscosity), the variation of viscosity with temperature, and the variation of specific heat with temperature fall within this category. other applications arise in heat-transfer research since certain gas mixtures can be concocted to have any prandtl number in the range at least between 0.2 and 0.8.
