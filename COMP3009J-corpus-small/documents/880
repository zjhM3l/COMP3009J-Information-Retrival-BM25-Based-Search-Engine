the design and testing of supersonic flutter models. the basic problems of flutter testing in the low supersonic speed range simulate full-scale airplanes when mach number is included as a parameter are reviewed and are compared with those where velocity is scaled when the leading edges become transonic,. these are compared with results given elsewhere and serve as a check on the results of tables i and ii.
