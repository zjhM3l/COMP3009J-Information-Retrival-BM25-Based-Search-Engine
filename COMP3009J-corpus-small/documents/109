the production of uniform shear flow in a wind tunnel. a nearly uniform shear flow was obtained in the working section of a wind tunnel by inserting a grid of parallel rods with varying spacing. the function of such a grid is to impose a resistance to the flow, so graded across the working section as to produce a linear variation in the total pressure at large distances downstream without introducing an appreciable gradient in static pressure near the grid. a method of calculating a suitable arrangement of the rods is described. although this method is strictly applicable only to weakly sheared flows, an experiment made with a grid designed for a shear parameter as large as 0.45 gave results in close agreement with the theory. there was no evidence from the experiment of any large-scale secondary flow accompanying the shear--a danger inherent in an empirical attempt to grade the resistance of the grid--nor was any tendency observed for the shear to decay with increasing distance from the grid.
