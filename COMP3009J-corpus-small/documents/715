motion of a ballistic missile angularly misaligned with the flight path upon entering the atmosphere and its effect upon aerodynamic heating, aerodynamic loads and miss distance. an analysis is given of the oscillating motion of a ballistic missile which upon entering the atmosphere is angularly misaligned with respect to the flight path. the history of the motion for some example missiles is discussed from the point of view of the effect of the motion on the aerodynamic heating and loading. the miss distance at the target due to misalignment and to small accidental trim angles is treated. the stability problem is also discussed for the case where the missile is tumbling prior to atmospheric entry.
