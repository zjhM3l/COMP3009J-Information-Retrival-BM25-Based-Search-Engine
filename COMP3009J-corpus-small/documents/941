viscous compressible and incompressible flow in slender channels. an analytical study is made of viscous flow in slender channels. similar solutions to the approximate equations of motion, valid for flow at moderate or high reynolds numbers in slender channels, are found for incompressible two-dimensional and axisymmetric flows and for compressible flows through two-dimensional channels with adiabatic walls. a study of compressible flows in convergent-divergent channels yields results regarding the effect of viscosity on the location of the sonic line, on the pressure ratio at the geometric throat and on the discharge coefficient for such channels.
