an investigation of the use of an auxiliary slot to re-establish laminar flow on low drag aerofoils. the use of an auxiliary slot on a laminar-flow aerofoil has been investigated to check whether laminar flow can be re-established by suction at the rear of the region of deposited dirt, flies, etc. results indicate that in the absence of unfavourable pressure gradients, it is possible to re-establish a laminar boundary layer by removing a little more than the whole turbulent layer reaching the slot, and preliminary estimates suggest that with efficient ducting it should be possible to achieve a reduction in overall effective drag coefficient by this means.
