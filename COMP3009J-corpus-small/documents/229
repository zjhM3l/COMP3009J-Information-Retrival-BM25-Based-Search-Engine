interference between the wings and tail surfaces of a combination of slender body, cruciform wings and cruciform tail set at both incidence and yaw. the interference between the wings and the tail surfaces of a combination of circular body, low aspect ratio cruciform wings and cruciform tail in an inviscid flow is analysed using the slender body theory. the system may be subjected to both incidence and yaw and, in general, the tail fins may be staggered angularly with respect to the main wings. the method is a development of that used by owen and maskell in r.a.e. report no. aero.2441 to analyse similar effects on a system set at zero yaw. simple expressions to determine the strengths and positions of the trailing vortices (supposed to be rolled-up) downstream of the main wings are given, and from them the forces on the tail are deduced. when the tail surfaces are triangular and of low aspect ratio an exact solution is obtained from slender body theory.. but for rectangular tail surfaces of moderate or high aspect ratio, it is suggested that the changes in lift and sideforce on the tail caused by the wing vortex field can be estimated approximately from the mean upwash and sidewash angles evaluated over the respective tail spans. formulae for these means angles are presented.
