new developments in the nonlinear theories of the buckling of thin cylindrical shells. in the present paper a short survey will be given first of the buckling and postbuckling behavior of isotropic cylindrical shells subjected to different loading conditions as obtained by the nonlinear theory of finite deflections of shells during the last twenty years. next a report will be given on new investigations carried out in the structures department of the dvl concerning the elastic stability of isotropic and orthotropic cylindrical shells loaded in axial compression and internal pressure. these studies are based on the nonlinear theory of finite deformations. the theoretical rsults will be compared with new experimental results obtained with a series of axially loaded pressurized isotropic and orthotropic cylindrical shells.
