a refinement of the linearised transonic flow theory. a new method is proposed to calculate the velocity and pressure distributions around a thin symmetrical aerofoil or a slender body of revolution flying at transonic speed. it is essentially a refinement of the linearized transonic flow theory due to oswatitsch and maeder, such that a correction term is introduced to take account of the nonlinear character of the transonic flow. as examples of application, a symmetrical circular-arc aerofoil and a circular-arc body of revolution in the sonic flow are dealt with, and the results are found to be in good agreement with experiments, except for the rear portion in the latter case.
