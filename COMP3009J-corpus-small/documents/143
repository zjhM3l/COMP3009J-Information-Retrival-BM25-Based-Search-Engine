interplanetary orbits. the basic equations under simplified conditions for interplanetary flight are derived. for a voyage from planet to planet an unlimited number of orbits is possible. in order to give a clear survey of these possible orbits a diagram is developed from which the approximate energy-requirement, the duration, and other particulars of a voyage can be easily found.
