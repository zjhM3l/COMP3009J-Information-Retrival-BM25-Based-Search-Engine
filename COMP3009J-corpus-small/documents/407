stationary convection flow of an electrically conducting liquid between parallel plates in a magnetic field. a study is made of the stationary convection of an electrically conducting liquid in the space between two parallel plates, heated to different temperatures, in the presence of a magnetic field. the distribution of velocity, temperature, and induced fields are found, and the convective heat flow is calculated.
