similar temperature boundary layers. conditions for the existence of similar solutions are known for (a) two-dimensional, incompressible, steady and nonsteady laminar boundary layers and (b) three-dimensional, incompressible, steady, laminar boundary layers for a body of revolution rotating in a fluid at rest or a body of revolution in a rotating fluid flow. corresponding conditions for the existence of similar temperature boundary layers in both cases are given for constant and variable wall temperatures. the general conclusion is that, in all these cases, with or without viscous heating, and with constant wall temperature, conditions for the existence of similar velocity boundary layers are at the same time the conditions for the existence of similar temperature boundary layers. if the wall temperature is variable, the conditions for the existence of similar velocity boundary layers are at the same time the conditions for the existence of similar temperature boundary layers if the wall temperature varies as a power of the local free-stream velocity or surface velocity. numberical solutions are given for the nondimensional temprature distributions function and the nondimensional temperature gradient at the wall for several prandtl numbers in the case of a rotating flow over an infinite plate at rest.
