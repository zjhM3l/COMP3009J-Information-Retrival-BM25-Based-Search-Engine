low speed wind tunnel tests on a two dimensional aerofoil with split flap near the ground. pressure distributions have been measured on a 10 thick two-dimensional aerofoil of r.a.e.101 section fitted with split flaps deflected at 15 and 55. measurements were made at two distances above a ground plate, and also without the ground plate. the results have been integrated to give the sectional lift, drag and pitching-moment coefficients.
