recent advances in the buckling of thin shells. the importance of the field of shell analysis is evidenced by the fact that in august, 1959, the international union of theoretical and applied mechanics conducted a symposium on the theory of thin elastic shells in delft, holland. this special meeting was attened by approximately 65 scientists in this field from 14 countries. this symposium indicated that considerable interest currently exists in such relatively new topics as the buckling of bimetallic shells, pressurized shells, creep buckling, and dynamic buckling, as well as in the more traditional problems involving isotropic shells of various geometries.
