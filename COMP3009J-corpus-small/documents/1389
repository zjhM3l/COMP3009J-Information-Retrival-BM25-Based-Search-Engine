numerical construction of detached shock waves. this article proposes a new method for solving the problem of the detached shock wave. if the shock wave is assumed known, a cauchy problem for a system of partial differential equations arises. this has been solved by several authors in the region where the system is elliptic (near the peak of the shock wave). considering the plane stationary case, the author seeks an analytic continuation of the propagation function (x,y) in the complex plane y = y1 + y2, x real. in the plane (x, y2) the propagation function satisfies a hyperbolic equation (near the peak of the shock wave). a new cauchy problem is solved and the solution of the original problem obtained by analytic continuation. a numerical example is treated with many details.
