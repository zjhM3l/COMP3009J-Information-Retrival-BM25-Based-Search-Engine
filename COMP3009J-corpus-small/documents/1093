induced interference effects on jet and buried-fan vtol configurations in transition. recent investigations of some jet and buried-fan configurations have indicated that in the transition speed range, configurations with considerable area surrounding the jet or buried fan can encounter large losses in lift and nose-up pitching moments due to the pressures induced on the lower surfaces by the interaction of the jet and free-stream flow. the obvious way of minimizing these effects is to reduce the surface area surrounding the jets or buried fans, that is, to consider these effects in the preliminary stages of the airplane design.
