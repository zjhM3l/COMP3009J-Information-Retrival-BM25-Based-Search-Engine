incompressible wedge flows of an electrically conducting viscous fluid in the presence of a magnetic field. the purpose of this note is to discuss the two-dimensional flow of an electrically conducting viscous fluid past a wedge in the presence of a magnetic field. the governing differential equations and boundary conditions are given and analyzed.
