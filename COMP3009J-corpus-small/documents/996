extension of boundary layer separation criteria to a m=6.5 utilizing flat plates with forward-facing steps. an experimental investigation has been made of the separation phenomena on a flat plate to which forward-facing steps were attached to force separation. both laminar and turbulent flows were investigated over a mach number range of approximately distributions, shadowgraph and chemical film techniques, the pressure rise at separation, the laminar plateau pressure, and the turbulent peak pressure were determined. boundary-layer surveys were made on a smooth flat plate and on a flat plate with roughness to force transition. examinations of the separated flow showed that the predominant variable in the determination of the pressure distribution was the location of transition relative to the separation point and reattachment. pure laminar, transitional, and turbulent types of separation were found in this mach number range. the peak static-pressure-rise ratios for identical forward-facing steps at a mach number of 6.25 were approximately 1.5 and 5.0, respectively, for pure laminar and turbulent separation. the effect of reynolds number on the peak pressure rise for turbulent separation for the lower mach number range was found to be very minor provided the step height was of the order of the boundary-layer thickness. as the mach number is increased, the peak pressure coefficient for turbulent separation decreased from approximately 0.18 at a mach number of 4 to about 0.13 at a mach number of 6.25. the pressure coefficient at the separation point for laminar separation decreases from approximately 0.014 at a mach number of value at a mach number of 6.5. the results obtained with forward-facing steps agree with the trends predicted, based upon lower mach number studies.
