recent advances in gaseous detonation. a review of recent work in gaseous detonation is presented. early work is briefly mentioned and treatises listed. theoretical calculations of chapman-jouguet detonations are reviewed, compared and the ambiguity concerning the speed of sound in a reacting gas mixture discussed. experimental chapman-jouguet measurements are reviewed. recent studies of the interior of a detonation wave are presented. standing detonation wave research, detonation limits, two-dimensional detonations, spectra, ionization and magnetohydrodynamic treatments are brought to the reader's attention. a qualitative description of the development of a flame to a detonation is presented. experimental observations are examined and recent theoretical attempts to explain these observations are reviewed.
