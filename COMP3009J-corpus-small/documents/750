transonic flow in two dimensional and axially symmetrical nozzles. by means of suitable expansions in inverse powers of r, the radius of curvature of the nozzle profile at the throat measured in throat half-heights, the velocity components in the throat region of a convergent-divergent nozzle can be calculated. the first three terms of the series solution have been obtained both for two-dimensional and for axially-symmetric nozzles. the numerical accuracy of the solution is confirmed by comparison with the known exact solution along the branchline.
