the temperature history in a thick skin subjected to laminar heating during entry into the atmosphere. during high speed entry into the earth's atmosphere, a vehicle can be afforded thermal protection for the short period of entry heating by a thick outer skin, sometimes called a /heat sink/. the temperature distribution in such a heat sink has been found by integrating the product of the laminar aerodynamic heating rate and the appropriate green's function for a finite-thickness wall over the generalized trajectory for a vehicle entering the earth's atmosphere at high speeds dimensional heat conduction problem for laminar heating. the maximum surface temperature that occurs during the generalized entry trajectory for any combination of wall thickness and thermal properties is obtained from which the performance of any material can be found, provided that the average thermal properties may be used. as an example of the use of the solution, the performance of copper, graphite, molybdenum and tungsten are compared.
