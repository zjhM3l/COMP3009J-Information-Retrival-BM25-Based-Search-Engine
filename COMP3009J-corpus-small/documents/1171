the stability under axial compression and lateral pressure of circular cylindrical shells with a soft elastic core. the stability under axial compression and lateral pressure of a finite circular-cylindrical shell with an elastic core is treated by means of donnell's equations. the stability criterion is investigated in detail for the general cylinder under axial compression or lateral pressure and for a particular cylinder under combined loading. comparisons are made with available experimental data.
