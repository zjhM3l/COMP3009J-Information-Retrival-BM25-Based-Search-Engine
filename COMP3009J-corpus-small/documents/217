flow pattern in a converging-diverging nozzle. the present report describes a new method for the prediction of the flow pattern of a gas in the two-dimensional and axially symmetrical case. it is assumed that the expansion of the gas is adiabatic and the flow stationary. the several assumptions necessary on the nozzle shape effect, in general, no essential limitation on the conventional nozzles. the method is applicable throughout the entire speed range,. the velocity of sound itself plays no singular part. the principal weight is placed on the treatment of the flow near the throat of a converging-diverging nozzle. for slender nozzles formulas are derived for the calculation of the velocity components as function of the location.
