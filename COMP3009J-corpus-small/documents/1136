design of thin walled torispherical and toriconical pressure - vessel heads. the failure under hydrostatic test of a large storage vessel designed in accordance with current practice stimulated earlier analytical studies. this paper gives curves and a table useful for the design and analysis of the knuckle region of a thin torispherical or toriconical head of an unfired cylindrical vessel. a simple but surprisingly adequate approximate formula is presented for the limit pressure, np, at which appreciable plastic deformations occur.. where p is the design pressure, is the yield stress of the material, and n is the factor of safety. the thickness t of the knuckle region is assumed uniform. upper and lower bound calculations were made for ratios of knuckle radius r to cylinder diameter d of 0.06, 0.08, 0.10, 0.12, 0.14, and 0.16, and ratios of spherical cap radius l to d of 1.0, 0.9, 0.8, 0.7, and 0.6. toriconic1a heads may be designed or analyzed closely enough by interpreting in table 1 as the complement of the half angle of the cone.
