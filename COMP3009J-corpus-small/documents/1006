free-flight measurements of the static and dynamic. the inviscid flow of a perfect gas over blunt-nosed axisymmetric and two-dimensional bodies at zero angle of attack has been calculated numerically on an ibm 7090 computer. the computation consisted of the fuller blunt-body solution for the subsonic and transonic regions and the method of characteristics for the supersonic region. the flow fields about a number of blunt bodies were studied, and the calculated results showed good agreement with experimental shock-wave shapes, surface-pressure distributions, and flow-field surveys.
