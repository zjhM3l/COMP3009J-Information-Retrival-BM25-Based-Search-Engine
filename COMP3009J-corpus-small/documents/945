method for design of pump impellers using a high speed digital computer. a method of designing pump impellers is derived from the equations of motion and continuity for incompressible nonviscous relative flow. the flow is assumed to follow a known stream surface (representing blade shape) that extends from hub to shroud. equations are also derived for approximate blade-surface velocities and pressures. a detailed numerical procedure and block diagram are given for use on a digital computer. a numerical example that illustrates limited use of the method is presented and further uses are indicated.
