principles of creep buckling weight-strength analysis. published work on creep buckling has implied that failure of columns after a critical time is caused by initial imperfections. such analyses are relatively complex and ultimately leave the choice of selecting the proper value of the initial imperfection to the designer. furthermore, recent test results on creep buckling of columns have indicated that there is a random and relatively unimportant effect of small initial imperfections on the critical time. to avoid the difficulties associated with initial imperfections, a formulation of the creep buckling phenomenon in terms of classical stability theory is presented. the theory permits the extension of known solutions for plastic buckling of certain thin plates and shells to creep buckling problems.
