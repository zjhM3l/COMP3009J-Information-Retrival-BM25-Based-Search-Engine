a study of the thermal fatigue behaviour of metals. the effect of test conditions on nickel-base high temperature alloys. an attempt has been made to identify the significant factors governing the thermal-fatigue behaviour of nickel-base high-temperature alloys, mainly by using a laboratory technique with hot and cold fluidized beds as the heating and cooling media. a succession of heating shocks is generally more damaging than a succession of cooling shocks between the same temperature limits. the duration of the heating shock and the upper temperature of the cycle are dominant factors. the thermal-fatigue cracks are initiated at the surface and are intercrystalline in origin and propagation. surface oxidation, which is intergranular in nature for nickel-base alloys, has a significant effect on thermal-fatigue life.
