force measurements on square and dodecagonal sectional cylinders at high reynolds numbers. results are given of measurements in the compressed air tunnel of the forces on two cylinders, one of square cross-section and the other dodecagonal. the tests were carried out at various reynolds numbers ranging from approximately 0.1 x 10 to 5.5 x 10, based on the distance between parallel faces.
