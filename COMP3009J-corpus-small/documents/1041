analysis of stresses in the elements of shell structure. the love-meissner analysis for thin shells has previously been applied to cones of uniform wall thickness, and solutions for the stress resultants were given in terms of kelvin's functions. since tabulation of these functions for large arguments is not practical, considerable computation was still required. in the present paper, the authors define special functions which eliminate the necessity of evaluating kelvin/s functions and which may be used with simple algebraic and trigonometric functions to compute the boundary forces and displacements for cones for various loading conditions. these special functions also make clear the magnitude of errors which result from geckeler/s and other approximate solutions.
