on transverse vibrations of thin, shallow elastic shells. the report presents information on the stress problems in the analysis of pressurized cabins of high-altitude aircraft not met with in other fields of stress analysis relating to aircraft. the material may be roughly divided into shell problems and plate problems, the former being concerned with the curved walls of the cabin or pressure vessel and the latter being concerned with small rectangular panels of its walls, framed by stiffeners, but not necessarily plane.
