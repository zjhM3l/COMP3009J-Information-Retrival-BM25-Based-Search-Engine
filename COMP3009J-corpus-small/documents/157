the hodographic transformation in transonic flow. the author studies the problem of finding the shape of a symmetrical nozzle with the velocity along the axis (x-axis) specified. the velocity along each streamline is assumed to increase steadily. the singularity at the sonic velocity and to the axis of the nozzle) is first studied in the physical plane by using a power series in. in the hodograph plane, the two characteristics of the hodograph differential equation passing through the sonic point and are lines of branch points. the region between these lines is a region of triple-valuedness for the stream function. outside this region is single-valued. there are also singularities at the sonic point and the point corresponding to the specified condition at the exit of the nozzle. the author then proposes to construct in the hodograph plane by at the exit velocity and (3) a finite sum regular throughout.. sin, where r is the square of the velocity and the are hypergeometric functions. the a's are fixed by the required approximation to the specified velocity distribution along the axis. this solution is single-valued, convergent and represents except a region near the sonic point in the nozzle. for this excluded region, the author inverts the solution to obtain a power series in for 0. this is shown to be convergent for the region of interest. the type of solution considered by the author gives a nozzle having an infinitely long supersonic part.
