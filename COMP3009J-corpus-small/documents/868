design and operation of the n. g. t. e. thermal shock analogue. a description is given of the n.g.t.e. thermal shock analogue which is suitable for estimating the temperature in a turbine blade section as a function of position and time when the blade is subjected to a step change in gas temperature. the method of operating the analogue and obtaining results has also been described. the limitations of the analogue have been stated, but they are considered a small penalty in view of the essential simplicity of the design.
