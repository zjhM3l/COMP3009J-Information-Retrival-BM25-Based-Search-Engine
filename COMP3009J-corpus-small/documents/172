some aerodynamic considerations of nozzle afterbody combination. the aerodynamic problems associated with propulsion-system installations have assumed a role of vital importance in the development of supersonic aircraft. although air-induction systems have received moderate attention in the literature, considerably less information can be found on the design and installation of turbojet exit nozzles. this condition should not be interpreted to indicate a lack of problems in jet-exit design. as flight speeds reach supersonic levels, it becomes increasingly difficult to achieve nozzle installations which are efficient over the entire speed range. the difficulties largely stem from the fact that the goals of high jet thrust and low afterbody drag are not always compatible. in many of the compromise solutions, it is generally unsatisfactory to examine isolated nozzle and afterbody performance. rather they must be treated as a unit, and the complex effects of jet interaction with the external stream must be taken into account. to accomplish this, the nozzle and air-frame designers must closely coordinate their efforts. some of the aerodynamic problems of nozzle afterbody combinations are outlined in this report. particular attention is devoted to the influence of the jet-stream interaction on both nozzle thrust and after-body drag. for this purpose, use is made of shock- boundary-layer-interaction concepts. this approach, although not precise, correctly predicts many trends and is generally enlightening.
