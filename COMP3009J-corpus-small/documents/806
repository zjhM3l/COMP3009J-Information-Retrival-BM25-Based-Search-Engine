ground measurements of airplane shock wave noise at mach numbers to 2, and at altitudes of 60,000 feet. the intensity of shock-wave noise at the ground resulting from flights at mach numbers to 2.0 and altitudes to 60,000 feet was measured. measurements near the ground track for flights of a supersonic fighter and one flight of a supersonic bomber are presented. level cruising flight at an altitude of 60,000 feet and a mach number of 2.0 produced sonic booms which were considered to be tolerable, and it is reasonable to expect that cruising flight at higher altitudes will produce booms of tolerable intensity for airplanes of the size and weight of the test airplanes. the measured variation of sonic-boom intensity with altitude was in good agreement with the variation calculated by an equation given in nasa technical note d-48. the effect of mach number on the ground overpressure is small between mach numbers of 1.4 and 2.0, a result in agreement with the theory. no amplification of the shock-wave overpressures due to refraction effects was apparent near the cutoff mach number. a method for estimating the effect of flight-path angle on cutoff mach number is shown. experimental results indicate agreement with the method, since a climb maneuver produced booms of a much decreased intensity as compared with the intensity of those measured in level flight at about the same altitude and mach number. comparison of sound pressure levels for the fighter and bomber airplanes indicated little effect of either airplane size or weight at an altitude of 40,000 feet.
