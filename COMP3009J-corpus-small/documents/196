pressure distributions. axially symmetric bodies in oblique flow. a simple picture, known from the work of i. lotz, of the flow over the forward part of a body of revolution in oblique flow is derived here from entirely elementary considerations. the pressure at any point of the (forward part of the) body at any angle of incidence depends on three parameters whose values vary along the body. the variation of these parameters along the body can be determined from a relatively small number of wind tunnel or water tunnel measurements. the necessary water tunnel measurements have been made for four axially symmetric head shapes. additional measurements have been made to illustrate the theoretical conclusions. the data for each head shape are adequate for a determination of the pressure coefficient at any point on the head shapes at any angle of incidence (up to 6, say). in particular they can be used to determine the peak suction at any angle of incidence and so the conditions for the onset of cavitation on the head.
