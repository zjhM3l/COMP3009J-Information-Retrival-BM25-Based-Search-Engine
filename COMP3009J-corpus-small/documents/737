on the analysis of elastic plates of variable thickness. the extensional and flexural equations governing the elastic behaviour of a plate of variable thickness are expressed in terms of the laplacian operator. temperature variations in the plane of the plate and across the thickness of the plate are taken into account. general solutions are given for a rectangular plate whose thickness varies exponentially along the length, and for a circular, or annular, plate whose thickness varies as a power of the radius. the large-deflexion equations, including effects of initial irregularities, are also discussed.
