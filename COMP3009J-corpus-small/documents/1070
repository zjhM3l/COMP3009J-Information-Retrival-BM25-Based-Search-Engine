buckling of orthotropic and stiffened conical shells. donnell type stability equations for thin circular orthotropic conical shells are presented and solved for external pressure, axial compression and combined loading. the solution is likewise applied to stiffened conical shells. correlation with equivalent cylindrical shells yields a simple approximate stability analysis for orthotropic or ring-stiffened conical shells under hydrostatic pressure. the general instability of stiffened conical shells under hydrostatic pressure is also analysed by a more accurate approach. preliminary experimental results for buckling of ring-stiffened conical shells under hydrostatic pressure are presented and discussed.
