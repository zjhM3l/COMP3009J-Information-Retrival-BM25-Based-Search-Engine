factors affecting lift-drag ratios at mach numbers from 5 to 20. yawed-cone working charts and an engineering method are presented and used to calculate lift-drag ratios of flat-top conical wing-body arrangements at mach numbers from 5 to 20. viscous interaction effects are considered, but bluntness effects are neglected. correlations of wind-tunnel data in the range show that boundary layer displacement corrections to surface pressure and skin friction are required to calculate lift-drag ratios by this method whenever is greater than 0.2. is the freestream mach number and is the freestream reynolds number based on body length. double- and single-type shock patterns, transition from one pattern to the other, and the variation of inner-shock position with angle of attack are described. lift-drag ratios are calculated at selected flight design points for flat-top, conical body arrangements with triangular and hyperbolic wing planforms. the hyperbolic wing arrangement offers a potential l d benefit at mach 5 but not at mach 10 or above.
