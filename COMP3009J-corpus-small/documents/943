compressible free shear layer with finite initial thickness. the momentum equation was uncoupled from the other conservation equations for the case of a finite initial profile in a laminar free shear layer. the equation was solved numerically, in the crocco coordinate system, using an implicit finite difference method. profiles of velocity and shear function were obtained as a function of streamwise distance. the initial profiles as the flow separates from the rear of the body correspond to the blasius profile in transformed coordinates. for large distances downstream, the profiles approach the chapman distribution, corresponding to the case of zero initial free shear layer thickness. the effect of these results on calculations of base pressure and wake angle is discussed. a method for the calculation of finite chemical kinetic effects on the profiles of temperature and chemical composition in the free shear layer with finite initial thickness is outlined.
