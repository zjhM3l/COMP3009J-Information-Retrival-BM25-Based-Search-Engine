intensity, scale and spectra of turbulence in mixing region of free subsonic jet. the intensity of turbulence, the longitudinal and lateral correlation coefficients, and the spectra of turbulence in a 3.5 inch-diameter free jet were measured with hot-wire anemometers at exit mach numbers from 0.2 to 0.7 and reynolds numbers from the results of these measurements show the following.. (1) near the nozzle (distances less than 4 or 5 jet diam downstream of the nozzle) the intensity of turbulence, expressed as percent of core velocity, is a maximum at a distance of approximately increasing mach and or reynolds number. at distances greater than 8 jet diameters downstream of the nozzle, however, the maximum intensity moves out and decreases in magnitude until the turbulence-intensity profiles are quite flat and approaching similarity. (2) the lateral and longitudinal scales of turbulence are nearly independent of mach and or reynolds number and in the mixing zone near the jet vary proportionally with distance from the jet nozzle. (3) farther downstream of the jet the longitudinal scale reaches a maximum and then decreases approximately linearly with distance. (4) near the nozzle the lateral scale is much smaller than the longitudinal and does not vary with distance from the centerline, while the longitudinal scale is a maximum at a distance from the centerline of about mum moves out from the centerline. (6) a statistical analysis of the correlograms and spectra yields a /scale/ which, although different in magnitude from the conventional, varies similarly to the ordinary scale and is easier to evaluate.
