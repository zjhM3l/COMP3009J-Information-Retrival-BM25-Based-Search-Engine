interaction effects produced by jet exhausting laterally near base of ogive-cylinder model in supersonic main stream. the experimentally determined interaction effects of a side jet exhausting near the base of an ogive-cylinder model are presented and discussed. the interaction force appears to be independent of main-stream mach number, boundary-layer condition /laminar or turbulent/, angle of attack, and forebody length. the ratio of interaction force to jet force is found to be inversely proportional to the square root of the product of jet stagnation-to-free-stream pressure ratio and jet-to- body diameter ratio.
