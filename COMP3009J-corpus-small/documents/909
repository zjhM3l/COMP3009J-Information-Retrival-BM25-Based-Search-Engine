the effect of jet noise on aircraft structures. the present state of knowledge on the problem of fatigue failure due to vibrations excited by jet noise is reviewed. it is concluded that it should currently be possible to make reasonable estimates of the stress levels set up in a structure by jet noise but, in general, the resultant fatigue life of the components cannot be estimated with any confidence.
