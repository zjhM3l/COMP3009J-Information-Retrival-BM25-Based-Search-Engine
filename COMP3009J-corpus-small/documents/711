an investigation at subsonic speeds of aerodynamic characteristics at angles of attack from -dash 4degrees to 100degrees of a delta-wing reentry configuration having folding wingtip panels. an investigation was made at subsonic speeds in the langley highspeed lifting reentry configuration having folding wingtip panels. the configuration is of the type used in a high angle-of-attack /near 90degree/ reentry to minimize aerodynamic heating. by unfolding the wingtip panels into the airstream, a moderate angle-of-attack glide is used for a controlled landing. the basic configuration tested utilized a whose area was 25 percent of the total wing area. the effects of varying the plan form and size of the wingtip panels was studied as well as the effects of unfolding the wingtip panels in a high angle- of-attack attitude. tests were made at mach numbers of 0.40, 0.60, and
