pressure distributions at zero lift for delta wings with rhombic cross sections. the linearised theory of thin wings is used to calculate pressure distributions over delta wings with rhombic cross sections. a deuce programme has been written for the calculation and some of the results are compared with those of slender thin wing theory.
