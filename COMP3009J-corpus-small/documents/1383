on the theory of laminar boundary layer involving separation. the paper presents a mathematical discussion of the laminar boundary layer, which was developed with a view of facilitating the investigation of those boundary layers in particular for which the phenomenon of separation occurs. the treatment starts with a slight modification of the form of the boundary layer equation first published by von mises. two approximate solutions of this equation are found, one of which is exact at the outer edge of the boundary layer while the other is exact at the wall. the final solution is obtained by joining these two solutions at the inflection points of the velocity profiles. the final solution is given in terms of a series of universal functions for a fairly broad class of potential velocity distributions outside of the boundary layer. detailed calculations of the boundary layer characteristics are worked out for the case in which the potential velocity is a linear function of the distance from the upstream stagnation point. finally the complete separation point characteristics are determined for the boundary layer associated with a potential velocity distribution made up of two linear functions of the distance from the stagnation point. it appears that extensions of the detailed calculations to more complex potential flows can be fairly easily carried out by using the explicit formulae given in the paper.
