experimental investigation at a mach number of 3. 11 of the lift, drag and pitching moment characteristics of a number of blunt low-fineness-ratio bodies. a number of blunt bodies having shapes that may be suitable for atmospheric reentry were tested to determine the lift, drag, and pitching-moment characteristics at a mach number of 3.11 and a reynolds number of 6 x 10 based on maximum body diameter of 2 inches. the results of the tests showed that all the bodies were statically stable about a point located one-third of the body length from the nose. the results also showed that high-drag bodies which have a large portion of their afterbodies negatively sloped (decrease in cross-sectional area from nose to base) may have a negative lift-curve slope. this negative slope results from the large negative lift component of the axial force obtained with those bodies and the fact that with negatively sloped afterbodies only small normal forces are developed.
