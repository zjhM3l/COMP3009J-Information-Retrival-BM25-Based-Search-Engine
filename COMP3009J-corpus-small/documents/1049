elastic constants for corrugated core sandwich plates. the sandwich plate consisting of corrugated sheet fastened between two face sheets is considered. application of existing theories to the analysis of such a sandwich plate requires the knowledge of certain elastic constants. formulas and charts are presented for the evaluation of these constants. the formulas for three of these constants were checked experimentally and found to give values in close agreement with the experimental values.
