a theory of asymmetric hypersonic blunt-body flows. two-dimensional asymmetric and three-dimensional inviscid blunt-body flows are analyzed using a new method. the method is inverse, that is, the shock-wave shape and freestream conditions are taken as known, and the body shape and flow field are to be determined. results at zero angle of attack are obtained as a special case of the general problem. solutions at zero angle are calculated for a variety of body shapes at freestream mach numbers ranging from infinity to 1.85. the ratio of specific heats, is taken as 1.4. comparison with results obtained using van dyke's and garabedian's numerical solutions indicates that the method under consideration is more accurate than the van dyke method for determining stand-off distance. solutions are obtained for parabolic and paraboloidal shock waves at small angle of attack and infinite freestream mach number,. assumes the values 1.4, 1.2, 1.1, and 1.05. for all cases, the streamline that wets the body passes through the shock wave slightly above the point where the shock is normal and thus does not possess maximum entropy. these results provide counter examples to the conjecture that any isolated convex body in a supersonic stream is wetted by the streamline of maximum entropy.
