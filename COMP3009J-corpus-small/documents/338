mass transfer cooling at mach number 4. 8. mass-transfer experiments on a 5 mil wire porous cone of 20 total angle have been conducted at using air and helium injection. details of the experimental technique are described in references 1 and 2. in the laminar boundary layer the recovery factors and heat-transfer coefficients measured with zero injection agreed within per cent with theory. transition reynolds numbers observed on the porous cone with zero injection were half as large as observed on a smooth, impermeable model of identical geometry in the same channel, but injection of large amounts of air or helium did not cause transition to move forward from its zero-injection position on the porous cone. distributed roughness of this type apparently does not disturb impermeable wall theory, but it masks whatever effective roughness may be caused by discrete pore injection.
