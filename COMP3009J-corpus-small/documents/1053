spherical cap snapping. a nonlinear boundary value problem for the determination of the rotationally symmetric deformations of a clamped spherical cap under external pressure is solved by finite differences. the numerical solutions are obtained by employing a previously developed iteration procedure. a special case of the difference equations is solved explicitly and yields a justification of the iteration method as well as insight into the properties of the more accurate numerical solutions. buckled and unbuckled equilibrium states are obtained and the shape of the pressure-deflection curve which is usually assumed for these states is verified for a large class of caps. close estimates are given for the upper and lower buckling loads and an intermediate buckling load--i.e., the /dead-weight/ load. the stresses and deflections in the buckled and unbuckled states are examined and compared with an asymptotic solution valid in the interior of very thin shells. boundary layers are found to develop in the buckled states both as the loading increases and as the thickness of the shell decreases.
