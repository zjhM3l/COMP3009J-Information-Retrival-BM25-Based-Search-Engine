an approximate solution for the axisymmetric jet of a laminar compressible fluid. an extension of the modified-oseen method of carrier, based on the linearization of the viscous term of the von mises transformation, is presented. the method is employed to determine the velocity field associated with the laminar axisymmetric jet flow of a compressible gas with an arbitrary but constant external flow. the approximate solution is shown to be in good agreement with the exact numerical calculation of pai. in many boundary layer problems it is not possible to make the assumption of flow similarity. the solution in these cases can be obtained either by laborious finite difference techniques or by resort to approximate solutions. carrier and lewis (1), and more recently carrier (2), have suggested a method of obtaining approximate solutions to problems involving convection and diffusion. this method, termed by carrier /the modified-oseen method/, overcomes an essential difficulty of integral methods, namely, the generation of reasonable profiles. it is well known that the integral method gives accurate results only if the analytical profiles represent closely the true profiles. according to the modified-oseen method the convective operator in the original partial differential equation is replaced by a linear one. the resulting equation for the boundary layer problem is the heat conduction equation which can be treated by well-known techniques. it is the purpose of this paper to indicate a modification of this procedure and to demonstrate its simplicity and accuracy by treating the axisymmetric laminar flow of a compressible gas with arbitrary but constant external flow. the modification is based on the use of the von mises transformation with a subsequent linearization of the viscous term, rather than the linearization of the convective term. pai's problem (3), originally treated by a finite difference technique, is considered to illustrate the effectiveness of this method.
