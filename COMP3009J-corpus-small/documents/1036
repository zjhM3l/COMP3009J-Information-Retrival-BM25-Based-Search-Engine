on transverse vibrations of thin, shallow elastic shells. according to marguerre (proc. 5th internat. congress appl. mech., cambridge, mass., 1938, wiley, new york, shells are governed by three simultaneous differential equations in the three displacements. the author has considerably simplified this theory for the case of transverse vibrations by ignoring the longitudinal inertia terms, thus reducing the problem to that of solving two simultaneous differential equations in a stress function and one displacement component. this simplification is justified by an order-of-magnitude analysis, and illustrated by considering the vibrations of a paraboloidal shell with a rectangular boundary.
