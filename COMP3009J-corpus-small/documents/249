formulae for the computation of the functions employed for calculating the velocity distribution about a given aerofoil. in order to determine the velocity distribution about an arbitrary aerofoil, it is necessary to evaluate the functions and (in the notation of aerofoil theory) when is given numerically. if the values of are specified at 2n points equally spaced about the circle into which the aerofoil is transformed, the formulae obtained here may be used to calculate these functions at the same points. formulae are also given for calculating the integrals of or, since these have application to the design of aerofoils by thwaites's numerical method. the simplicity of the formulae for and enables the effect on the velocity distribution of a local change of shape readily to be determined by making n large. this is discussed in 3. the formulae are collected in the appendix, and a table of the coefficients for the case n = 20 is given.
