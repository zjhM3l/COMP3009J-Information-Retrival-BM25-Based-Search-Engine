note on tip-bluntness effects in the supersonic and hypersonic regimes. in a recent letter, m. h. bertram presents some data on flows at m = 6.85 around 10 half-angle cones with blunted tips. since the demarcation between the supersonic and hypersonic regimes is not sharp and since one expects hypersonic flows to be generally similar to those at lower mach numbers-- especially where viscous effects do not predominate throughout the entire field of interest--it is of some value to compare bertram's results with those obtained by giese and bergdolt for 15 half-angle cones at m = 2.45. following the observation by charters and stein that drag coefficient measurements on blunted cones imply a reynolds number effect, giese and bergdolt study the convergence to conical flow of the perturbed flow about a cone with truncated tip. they employ the mach-zehnder interferometer and the conical flow criterion as analytical tools.
