a turbulent analog of the stewartson-illingworth transformation. the stewartson-illingworth transformation is applied to the integral momentum equation for compressible boundary-layer flow, leaving the x-coordinate transformation unspecified, however. it is shown that the transformed equation is the integral momentum equation for incompressible flow if (a) the effect of compressibility on the boundary-layer shape parameter h can be represented by and (b) the x-coordinate transformation is chosen to be suitably related to the ratio of skin-friction coefficients in compressible and incompressible flows. experimental evidence is presented which shows that condition (a) is satisfied for turbulent boundary layers up to m = 5. an x-transformation is chosen according to (b) and an equation is presented which gives the turbulent boundary-layer growth in compressible flow in terms of a simple quadrature. the predictions of this equation are then compared with some measurements on wind-tunnel nozzles.
