stability of the cylindrical shell of variable curvature. the report is a first attempt to devise a calculation method for representing the buckling behavior of cylindrical shells of variable curvature. the problem occurs, for instance, in dimensioning wing noses, the stability behavior of which is decisively influenced by the variability of curvature. the calculation is made possible by simplifying the stability equations (permissible for the shell of small curvature) and by assuming that the curvature as a function of the arc length s can be represented by a very few fourier terms. we evaluated the formulas for the special case of an ellipse-like half oval with an axis ratio under compression in longitudinal direction, shear, and a combination of shear and compression. however, the results can also be applied approximately to an unsymmetrical oval-shell segment under compression, shear, and bending so that the numerical values contained in the diagrams 10 to 12 represent directly dimensioning data for the wing nose.
