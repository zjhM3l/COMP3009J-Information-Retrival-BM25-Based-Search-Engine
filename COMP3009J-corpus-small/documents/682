the lift of twisted and cambered wings in supersonic flow. a generalised conical flow theory is used to deduce an integral equation relating the velocity potential on a delta wing/with subsonic leading edges/to the given downwash distribution over the wing. the complete solution of this integral equation is derived. this complete solution is composed of two parts, one being symmetric and the other antisymmetric with respect to the spanwise co-ordinate,. each part represents a velocity potential. for example, if y is the spanwise co-ordinate and x is measured in the free stream direction, then a downwash of the form w-a ux/y/is symmetric and will give rise to a symmetric potential, whereas w-a ux/y/sgn y is anti-symmetric and gives rise to an anti-symmetric potential. the velocity potentials of such flows are given in the form of tables for all downwashes up to and including homogenous cubics in the spanwise and streamwise co-ordinates. table iii gives similar formulae in the limiting case were used over a cycle of the tumbling motion. the analytical expression was in good agreement with numerical solutions of the complete non-linear equations of motion.
