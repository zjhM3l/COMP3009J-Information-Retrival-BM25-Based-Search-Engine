calculated responses of a large sweptwing airplane to continuous turbulence with flight-test comparisons. calculated responses of symmetrical airplane motions, wing deformations, and wing loads due to gusts are shown to compare favorably with available flight-test results. these calculated responses are based on random-process theory, five degrees of freedom, lifting-surface aerodynamics, and one-dimensional vertical turbulence. the extent to which various degrees of freedom contribute to the responses is examined and in this connection the relative effects of static and dynamic aeroelasticity are determined.
