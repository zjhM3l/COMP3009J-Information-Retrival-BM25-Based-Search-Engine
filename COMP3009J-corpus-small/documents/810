the shock wave noise problem of supersonic aircraft in steady flight. data are presented which provide an insight into the nature of the shock-wave noise problem, the significant variables involved, and the manner in which airplane operation may be affected. flight-test data are also given, and a comparison with the available theory is made. an attempt is also made to correlate the subjective reactions of observers and some associated physical phenomena with the pressure amplitudes during full-scale flight. it is indicated that for the proposed supersonic transport airplanes of the future, booms on the ground will most probably be experienced during the major portion of the flight plan. the boom pressures will be most severe during the climb and descent phases of the flight plan. during the cruise phase of the flight, the boom pressures are of much lesser intensity but are spread laterally for many miles. the manner in which the airplane is operated appears to be significant,. for example, the boom pressures during the climb, cruise, and descent phases can be minimized by operating the airplane at its maximum altitude consistent with its performance capabilities.
