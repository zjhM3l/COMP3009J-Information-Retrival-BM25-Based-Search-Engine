finite difference formulae for the square lattices. the paper gives approximate formulae for derivatives (including combinations like and ), and integrals, of a function of two independent variables, in terms of its values at nodes of a square lattice, primarily for use in the numerical solution of partial differential equations. consideration is given to the form, as well as to the magnitude, of the leading terms in the error, and what is believed to be for most purposes optimum combinations are thus selected for the simpler compact sets of nodes.
