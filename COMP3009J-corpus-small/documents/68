some aspects of air-helium simulation and hypersonic approximations. some illustrations of the differences that may be expected between results obtained in hypersonic wind tunnels that employ air and results obtained in those that employ helium as the test medium (imperfect-gas effects are not considered) are compiled and presented herein. simple expressions are presented that demonstrate the possibility of simulating air results in helium tests and of transforming helium data to equivalent air data. nonviscous and viscous simulations are considered. in most cases, the methods and the general forms of the expressions for simulation that are derived are applicable to any two ideal gases having different ratios of specific heats.
