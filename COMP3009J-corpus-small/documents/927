investigation of normal force distributions and wake vortex characteristics of bodies of revolution at supersonic speeds. the supersonic aerodynamic characteristics of inclined bodies of revolution at high angles of attack have been investigated in order to provide a more basic understanding of the body vortex wake flow and its relation to the problem of body-wing interference. the results of wind-tunnel tests, whereby the normal force, pitching moment, normal force distributions, and the local flow properties in the vicinity of the body were determined, are discussed and analyzed. comparisons of experimental normal force coefficient and center of pressure data with values calculated in accordance with theories which include methods for estimating the effects of viscosity show that the accuracy of these estimates is strongly dependent on the body fineness ratio and the angle of attack. further comparisons of the distributions of theoretical and experimentally derived cross-flow drag coefficients clearly show that, in general, the disagreement between experiment and existing theories is due to the inadequate prediction of the magnitude and distribution of the forces resulting from flow separation. the circulation strengths of the concentrated vortices and the circulation strengths of the vortex feeding sheets in the body vortex wake are determined by closed-contour velocity-perimeter integrations for paths enclosing the vortex or the feeding sheet. the values of vortex strength calculated in this manner are in close agreement with the values predicted by vortex strength formulas written for a simple theoretical model for which it is assumed that the cross-flow in any plane along the cylindrical portion of the body is represented by the steady incompressible potential flow about a cylinder, two symmetrical vortices of equal strength, and the attendant image vortices. however, in computing these strengths it is necessary to use the vortex locations and the viscous normal force distributions determined from experiment. the experimentally determined values of vortex strength are, in turn, used to calculate--by means of the aforementioned incompressible cross-flow potential--the local flow inclination angles which are in good agreement with the measured values, except in the vortex core, in the vicinity of the feeding sheet, and in regions for which transonic cross-flow velocities are expected. a consideration of these various regions with simple methods which account for the observed phenomena leads to substantial improvement in the agreement between theory and experiment. it is indicated that the complete vortex wake flow may be adequately predicted for a body of revolution (for conditions represented by the theoretical flow model), provided that the distribution of the viscous normal force and the vortex locations are accurately known.
