leading-edge separation of laminar boundary layers in supersonic flow. a brief description of the flow field is given for the interaction of shock wave and laminar boundary layer on a compression corner in supersonic flow. a special sub-case--that of leading-edge laminar separation--is analyzed by extension of chapman's laminar mixing-layer theory. results are tabulated for ranges of mach number, and compression-corner angle. a limited region of possible leading-edge laminar separation with an attached leading-edge shock (or in certain cases an expansion) followed by a second shock due to the reattachment flow is found to exist. comparison with existing experimental data is found to be satisfactory in several cases.
