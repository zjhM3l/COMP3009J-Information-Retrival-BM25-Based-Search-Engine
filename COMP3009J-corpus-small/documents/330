taylor instability of finite surface waves. the instability of the accelerated interface between a liquid (methanol or carbon tetrachloride) and air has been investigated experimentally for approximate sinusoidal disturbances of wave-number range from well below to well above the cut-off. the growth rates are measured and compared with theoretical results. a third-order theory shows the phenomena of overstability which is found in the experimental results. some measurements of later stages of growth agree moderately well with the available theory and disclose some additional phenomena of bubble competition, helmholtz instability with transition to turbulence, and jet instability with production of drops.
