investigation of the stability of the laminar boundary layer in a compressible fluid. in the present report the stability of two-dimensional laminar flows of a gas is investigated by the method of small perturbations. the chief emphasis is placed on the case of the laminar boundary layer. part 1 of the present report deals with the general mathematical theory. the general equations governing one normal mode of the small velocity and temperature disturbances are derived and studied in great detail. it is found that for reynolds numbers of the order of those encountered in most aerodynamic problems, the temperature disturbances have only a negligible effect on those particular velocity solutions which depend primarily on the viscosity coefficient (/viscous solutions/). indeed, the latter are actually of the same form in the compressible fluid as in the incompressible fluid, at least to the first approximation. because of this fact, the mathematical analysis is greatly simplified. the final equation determining the characteristic values of the stability problem depends on the /inviscid solutions/ and the function of tietjens in a manner very similar to the case of the incompressible fluid. the second viscosity coefficient and the coefficient of heat conductivity do not enter the problem,. only the ordinary coefficient of viscosity near the solid surface is involved. part 2 deals with the limiting case of infinite reynolds numbers. the study of energy relations is very much emphasized. it is shown that the disturbance will gain energy from the main flow if the gradient of the product of mean density and mean vorticity near the solid surface has a sign opposite to that near the outer edge of the boundary layer. a general stability criterion has been obtained in terms of the gradient of the product of density and vorticity, analogous to the rayleigh-tollmien criterion for the case of an incompressible fluid. if this gradient vanishes for some value of the velocity ratio of the main flow exceeding 1-1/m (where m is the free stream mach number).
