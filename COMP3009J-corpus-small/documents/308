on the hypersonic viscous flow past a flat plate with suction or injection. the hypersonic viscous flow past a flat plate with suction or injection is dealt with by karman-pohlhausen's method in special cases when suction or injection velocity proportional to, especially for the region of strong interaction between the shock wave and the boundary layer, were p is the pressure on the plate and x is the distance measured along the plate from its leading edge. several numerical examples are given, which shows similar effects of injection to those in the case of incompressible flow that the injection makes all the height of the shock wave, the thickness of the boundary layer and the pressure on the plate larger than those in the case of no injection. on the contrary, in the case of suction no remarkable change both in the height of the shock wave and the pressure on the plate can be seen and only the velocity profile in the boundary layer is affected by the suction.
