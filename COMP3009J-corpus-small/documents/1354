investigation of the flow through a single stage two dimensional nozzle in the langley 11in. hypersonic tunnel. flow surveys have been made in the second of several nozzles to be investigated in the langley 11-inch hypersonic tunnel. the single-stage, two-dimensional nozzle was designed by the method of characteristics for a mach number of 7.08 without boundary-layer corrections. the test results show that reasonably uniform flow at an average mach number of about 6.86 was obtained in a central region of the stream at the test section. this region had a cross section nearly 5 inches square and had a deviation from uniform flow of less than 1 percent in mach number and 0.3 in flow angle. an increase in mach number of about 3 percent occurred during test runs of about 60 seconds duration because of distortions of the boundaries at the first minimum due to nonuniform heating of the nozzle blocks during the tests.
