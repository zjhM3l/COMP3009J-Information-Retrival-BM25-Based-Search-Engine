temperature measurements of shock-waves by spectrum-line reversal, ii a double beam method. the sodium-line reversal method, as previously described, using a photomultiplier and oscillograph, has been modified. two light beams are now employed, and interference filters are used in front of the photomultipliers instead of a spectrograph. in one beam the background source is viewed directly, through the shock tube, and in the other beam the background source is viewed through the shock tube by a mirror system with a neutral filter interposed to reduce its effective brightness temperature. with a suitably chosen temperature for the background, one oscillograph trace indicates absorption and the other indicates emission of the sodium lines. it is thus possible, from the records of a single shock, to determine the temperature history behind the shock wave to about 20degreec. nitrogen and oxygen again show relaxation effects near the front. temperatures in argon tend to come low, owing to radiative disequilibrium,. excitation processes in argon are discussed. with this system it is possible to determine temperatures rather higher than that of the background source. some work has also been done, with a single-beam method, using a carbon arc as background and following reversal of the indium blue line. temperatures up to 3600degreek have been measured in shocks through nitrogen, but the time resolution is not so good.
