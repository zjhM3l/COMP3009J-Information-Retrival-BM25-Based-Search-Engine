unsteady oblique interaction of a shock wave with plane disturbances. analysis is made of the flow field produced by oblique impingement of weak plane disturbances of arbitrary profile on a plane normal shock. three types of disturbance are considered.. moves. the sound wave refracts either as a simple isentropic sound wave or as an attenuating isentropic pressure wave, depending on the angle between the shock and the incident sound wave. a stationary vorticity wave of constant pressure appears behind the shock. reflects as a sound wave, and a stationary vorticity wave is produced. the shock. the incident wave refracts as a stationary vorticity wave, and either a sound wave or attenuating pressure wave is also produced. computations are presented for the first two types of incident wave, over the range of incidence angles, for shock mach numbers of 1, 1.5, and.
