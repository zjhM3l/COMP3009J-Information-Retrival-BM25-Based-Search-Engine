the transverse potential flow past a body of revolution. it is shown that in the potential flow of an incompressible inviscid fluid past a body of revolution set with its axis at right angles to the stream, the velocity components at the surface along and perpendicular to the meridians vary with azimuthal angle round the body in a simple manner. this is shown by entirely elementary considerations.
