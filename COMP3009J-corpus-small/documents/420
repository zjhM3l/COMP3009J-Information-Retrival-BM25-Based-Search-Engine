an experimental study of the flow field about swept and delta wings with sharp leading edges. a series of experiments was performed to define the flow field on the upper surface of high aspect ratio swept wings and narrow delta wings at high angles of attack. it was found that near the root section of either type of wing the flow is conical. the edge of the vortex sheet which originates at the leading edge is a straight line whose position relative to the leading edge depends only on incidence. on swept wings, the vortex edge turns down-stream as soon as the vortex sheet covers the front half of the wing chord, and the flow under the vortex sheet outboard of that turning point is uniform and parallel to the leading edge of the wing. on narrow delta wings, the conical symmetry persists almost to the trailing edge.
