the contraction of satellite orbits under the influence of air drag. part iii. high eccentricity orbits. /0.2 e 1/. the effect of air drag on satellite orbits of eccentricity e less than between 0.2 and 1 is presented. equations are derived which show how perigee distance and orbital period vary with eccentricity during the satellite's life, and how eccentricity is related to time,.and formulae are obtained for the lifetime and the air density at perigee, in terms of the rate of change of period. the results are also presented graphically and their implications and limitations are discussed.
