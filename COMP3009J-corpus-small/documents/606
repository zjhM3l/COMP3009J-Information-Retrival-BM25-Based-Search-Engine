formulae and approximations for aerodynamic heating rates in high speed flight. this note gives formulae and approximations suitable for making preliminary estimates of aerodynamic heating rates in high speed flight. the formulae are based on the /intermediate enthalpy/ approximation which has given good agreement with theoretical and experimental evidence. in the general flight case they could be used in conjunction with an analogue computer or a step-by-step method of integration to predict the variations of heat flow and skin temperature with time. in the restricted case of flight at constant altitude and mach number, simple analytical methods and results are given which include the effects of radiation and can be applied to /thick/ as well as /thin/ skins where h is the aerodynamic heat transfer factor, and g, d and k are the heat capacity, thickness and thermal conductivity of the skin. if 0.1 the skin is approximately /thin/, i.e. temperature gradients across its thickness may be neglected.
