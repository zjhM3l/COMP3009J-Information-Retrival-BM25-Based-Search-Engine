simplified analysis of general instability of stiffened shells in pure bending. although much work has been done to develop a theory for the failure of shells by general instability, there is at present no simple method by which the size of the frames may be determined for any given diameter, bending moment,.and frame spacing. such a method is needed in determining the optimum design for stiffened shells, to be used as a basis for weight analysis of fuselages, and other shell structures. in an extension of the work done for the rand corporation, a simple coefficient has been determined for this purpose. since it appears that this method may also be useful in design calculations, a brief description is presented below.
