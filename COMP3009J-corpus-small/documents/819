stresses in the plastic range around a normally loaded circular hole in an infinite sheet. the stresses in the plastic range around a normally loaded circular hole in an infinite sheet are found numerically on the basis of both deformation and incremental theories. the results of deformation theory are quantitatively assessed in the light of a criterion, recently developed by budiansky, for the acceptability of deformation theories. the criterion is completely satisfied. moreover, the results obtained by using these two different theories of plasticity do not differ greatly despite the fact that the stress paths are far from being radial.
