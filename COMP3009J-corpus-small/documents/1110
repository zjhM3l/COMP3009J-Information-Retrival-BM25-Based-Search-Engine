on supersonic flow past a slightly yawing cone. this paper is concerned with the motion of a circular cone, of not too blunt an angle, through air at high speed. if the direction of motion of the cone coincides with its axis of symmetry, the resulting air flow is well known. here we consider the perturbation produced by a small /yaw/--i.e., the case in which the cone is moving not quite in the direction of its axis. the results are confirmed experimentally, and have applications to ballistics, though we are not concerned with the latter here,. they may also be useful as providing a check on various approximate methods of wider applicability. the square of the yaw is neglected--an approximation of which the validity is discussed. (similar methods can be applied to the second-order effects of the yaw, which are also of ballistic significance,. but the computations have not yet been completed.) it should be observed that, because of the lack of symmetry, the flow will be neither irrotational nor isentropic.
