research on unsteady flow. this is a survey of certain recent advances made in the study of aerodynamic unsteady flow and of some of the new problems arising which require further investigation. no attempt is made to reproduce classical theory, but emphasis rather is laid on validity and general usefulness, particular attention being given to unsteady boundary-layer effects, especially when there is flow separation. coverage is broad and author thus provides a useful review for those interested in this field.
