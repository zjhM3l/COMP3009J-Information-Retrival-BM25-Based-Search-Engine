experimental measurements of turbulent transition motion, statistics and gross radial growth behind hypervelocity object. the laminar-turbulent transition behind 0.500-in.-diameter spheres at 8500 ft sec and behind measured as a function of pressure. schlieren motion-picture techniques were used to analyze the turbulent motion and the results are described. autocorrelation functions of the density fluctuations of the turbulence have been measured. from these values has been calculated and the results are given for several positions in the turbulent trail at 30 mm hg downstream air pressure. in addition the authors' previous measurements of the gross radial growth of the turbulent wake have been extended to pressures of 10 mm hg for the case of 0.500-in.-diameter spheres and to the trail behind
