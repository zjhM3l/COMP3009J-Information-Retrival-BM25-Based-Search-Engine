thermal analysis of stagnation regions with emphasis on heat-sustaining nose shapes at hypersonic speeds. the leading edges and noses of hypersonic vehicles are subjected to severe aerodynamic heating and must be cooled in some manner-dash e.g., internal convection, transpiration, or radiation. it is this latter mode of handling the problem that is discussed in this paper. neglecting conduction in the leading-edge region, the maximum temperature for long-range hypersonic gliders is of the same order as the melting point of refractory materials, with a corresponding large temperature gradient away from the leading edge. inclusion of conduction in the aft direction reduces the maximum temperature and distributes the heat to a location that will radiate it out from the surface. for either steady-state or transient conditions, the temperature at the leading edge is reduced by conduction, while the temperature aft of the leading-edge shoulder is increased, thus setting up a heat transmission balance between the convective influx of heat, the redistribution of heat by conduction, and the radiation of heat from the surface. the feasibility of such a mechanism can be enhanced by suitably choosing leading-edge shapes and materials. the philosophy behind the choice of leading-edge shapes is discussed and the effects of varying parameters, such as shape, diameter, emissivity, conductivity, thickness, etc., are shown.
