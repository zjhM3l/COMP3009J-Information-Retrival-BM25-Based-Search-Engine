non-linear bending and buckling of circular plates. iterative solutions of finite difference approximations of the non-linear von karman plate equations are presented. results are obtained for circular plates under a variety of boundary conditions subjected to either uniform lateral pressure or uniform edge thrust. the solution, carried out numerically on the aec univac at new york university, yields a complete description of stresses and deflections for an apparently unlimited range of load parameters. in addition, boundary layer phenomena are discussed. for computing purposes, this iterative method proves to be superior to the previously used power series method and may be applicable to other non-linear problems.
