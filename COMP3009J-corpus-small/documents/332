similitude of hypersonic real-gas flows over slender bodies with blunted noses. on the basis of the hypersonic small-perturbation theory, the laws of similitude for hypersonic inviscid flow fields over thin or slender bodies are examined, and the restrictions to ideal gases with constant specific heats and to bodies with pointed noses are removed. only steady plane or axisymmetric flows are considered. inspection of the governing system of equations shows that a similitude law exists for flow fields, under local thermal equilibrium, having the same free-stream atmosphere. for flows of ideal gas with constant specific heats, the requirement of the same free-stream atmosphere--i.e., the same composition, pressure, and density--can be replaced by the requirement of the same ratio of specific heats. for flows over blunted wedges or cones, special laws of similitude can be obtained. application of the similarity rules is examined for the case of hypersonic flows of an ideal gas with over flat plates with blunt leading edges, and for the case of equilibrium air flows over wedges. the possibility of simulating nonequilibrium flows over slender or thin bodies is also pointed out.
