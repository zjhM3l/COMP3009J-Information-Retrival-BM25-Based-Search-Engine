the injection of air into the dissociated hypersonic laminar boundary layer. in first approximation, dissociated air may be treated as a binary mixture of air atoms and air molecules. in order to include the effects of mass transfer into the boundary layer, it becomes necessary to introduce a third chemical species and hence a second diffusion equation. we have avoided this complexity by considering the injection of air molecules into the boundary layer, and hence the theoretical treatment is accomplished within the framework of a binary mixture gas.
