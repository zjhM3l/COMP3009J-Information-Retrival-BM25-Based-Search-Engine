note on an interaction between the boundary layer and the inviscid flow. according to the classical boundary-layer theory the flow about bodies at reynolds numbers of aeronautical interest can be considered as composed of two regimes.. an outside inviscid flow and a thin boundary-layer region adjacent to the body. this point of view leads to the approximation that, on a slightly curved surface, throughout the layer is negligibly small. the additional assumption that the inviscid flow is irrotational leads to the requirement that is zero at the outer edge of the boundary layer. in this theory any interaction between the two regimes is accountable by a simple correction to the body shape based on the boundary-layer displacement thickness. recently, in connection with hypersonic laminar boundary layers, this classical point of view has been modified., an interaction between the two flow regimes leading to a self-induced axial pressure gradient has been considered. it is the purpose of the present note to point out another type of interaction which may be of practical importance and of fundamental interest even at mach numbers below those considered in the hypersonic boundary-layer theory and which may have to be considered in that theory.
