design and test of mixed-flow impellers, viii - comparison of experimental results for three impellers with shroud redesigned by rapid approximate method. three centrifugal impellers with parabolic, circular, and skewed-parabolic blading were modified by a recently developed design procedure to reduce the velocity gradients along the hub from inlet to outlet. all original dimensions except the shroud contours were retained. experimental investigation showed that the modified impellers had better performance characteristics than the original impellers at all speeds investigated, the greatest gains occurring at speeds of 1300 feet per second and higher. these large gains probably resulted primarily from more favorable velocity gradients and from designing these impellers further away from the condition necessary for eddy formation. the modified impellers were thus able to operate over a wider range of weight flows at high speeds. the modified impellers were investigated over a range of equivalent speeds of 900 to 1500 feet per second and flow rates from maximum to the point of incipient surge. at 1300 feet per second, the peak pressure ratio and maximum adiabatic temperature-rise efficiency for the parabolic-bladed impeller were 3.07 and 0.825, respectively. for the same conditions, the circular-bladed impeller and the skewed-parabolic-bladed impeller had pressure ratios of 3.13 and 3.15 and efficiencies of 0.737 and 0.805, respectively. of the three, the parabolic-bladed impeller had the highest maximum efficiencies /0.854 to 0.800/ and the best weight-flow range over the speed range tested. on the basis of the parameters investigated, it appears that parabolic blading is superior to circular blading. the experimental results indicate that the design method of naca tn 3399 is a reliable method for use in designing centrifugal impellers.
