stability derivatives of cones at supersonic speeds. the aerodynamic stability derivatives due to pitching velocity and vertical acceleration are calculated by use of potential theory for circular cones traveling at supersonic speeds. the analysis is based on two theoretical techniques used successfully previously in application to the case of uniform axial and inclined flow. in the first, potential solutions for axial flow and crossflow are derived from the first-order wave equation but in application to calculations for the forces no approximations are made either to the tangency condition or to the isentropic pressure relation. the second method consists in combining the first-order crossflow potential with an axial-flow potential correct to second order. closed-form solutions by both methods are found for a cone, and numerical results for the stability derivatives are presented as a function of mach number for cones having semivertex angles of 10 and 20. in addition, expressions for the forces, moments, and stability derivatives of arbitrary bodies of revolution are obtained using newtonian impact theory. numerical results for cones compare well with those obtained from the combined first- and second-order potential theory at the highest mach number for which the latter theory is applicable.
