the effect of lift on entry corridor depth and guidance requirements for the return lunar flight. corridors for manned vehicles are defined consistent with requirements for avoiding radiation exposure and for limiting values of peak deceleration. use of lift increases the depth of the entry corridor. mid-course guidance requirements appear to be critical only for the flight-path angle. increasing the energy of the transfer orbit increases the required guidance accuracy for the flight-path angle. corrective thrust applied essentially parallel to the local horizontal produces the maximum change in perigee altitude for a given increment of velocity. energy required to effect a given change in perigee altitude varies inversely with range measured from the center of the earth.
