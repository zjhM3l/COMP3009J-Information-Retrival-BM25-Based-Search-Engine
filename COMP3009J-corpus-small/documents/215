the test performance of highly loaded turbine stages designed for high pressure ratio. a blade design for a highly loaded two-stage turbine is described and the test performance of the turbine is presented. some of the factors affecting the performance and matching of turbine blade rows operating at supersonic gas velocity are discussed and investigated by means of tests on a three-dimensional nozzle cascade tunnel and on a variety of single-stage turbine builds.
