addendum to 'heat transfer to satellite vehicles re-entering the atmosphere. the original paper gave a correlation formula for stagnation point heat transfer rate to a blunt body of revolution in hypersonic flow. this note gives a somewhat refined version, based on further calculation and shock tube data. its effect on the conclusions of the original paper is negligible except at surface temperature parameters of over 5000 r-ft1/8. in other problems, where heat transfer rate itself is important, it can make a significant defference.
