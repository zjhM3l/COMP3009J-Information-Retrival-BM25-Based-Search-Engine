freeman method. the freeman method (ref. 26) is similar to chester's method in that the newtonian-plus-centrifugal solution (eq. with the von mises transformation. a method of successive approximations is applied to both plane and axially symmetric blunt-nosed bodies for small and infinite free-stream mach number. formulas for the streamlines, shock shape, and pressure distribution are determined to this approximation. a number of special shapes are treated in ref. 26, and in certain cases the theory has a singular point where the first approximation to the pressure vanishes., that is, for a sphere (see eq. 7-113). as in chester's method, the theory is not applicable where the pressure becomes too small.
