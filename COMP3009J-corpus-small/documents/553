ablation of glassy materials around blunt bodies of revolution. the steady-state equations of motion for a thin layer of an incompressible glassy material on the surface of an ablating and radiating blunt body are reduced to a first-order ordinary differential equation which is integrated numerically. this solution is coupled with the solution of the air boundary layer for both laminar and turbulent heat transfer with or without mass vaporization of the ablating material. the distribution of the effective energy of ablation around the body is thus obtained for a cone cylinder with a hemispherical cap that re-enters the atmosphere at hypersonic flight speeds, and has quartz as the ablating material. it is found that the ablation process from turbulent heating is more efficient than from the laminar case because of increased vaporization. this solution of the equations of motion at the stagnation point has been verified by are wind tunnel experiments. the present state of development of the are wind tunnel does not permit its use for experimental investigations of ablation around blunt bodies under turbulent heating.
