heat transfer in the laminar boundary layer with ablation of vapor of arbitrary molecular weight. the reduction of heat transfer in the laminar boundary layer under the condition of vaporizing ablation is analyzed for arbitrary molecular weight of the vapor. primary assumptions are that the pressure gradient is zero, the individual components of the binary system are perfect gases, the prandtl number is constant, and the viscosity is proportional to temperature. variations through the boundary layer of the schmidt number for binary diffusion and the density-viscosity product, are included in the analysis. the wall temperature is held constant. numerical results are obtained for prandtl numbers of 0.75 and varying from 0.25 to 4.00, wall concentration of the foreign gas as high as 0.9 (corresponding to the high heat rates encountered during re-entry), and ratio of specific heats of foreign gas equal to that of air. kinetic theory is used to obtain schmidt number as a function of molecular weight and concentration. the departure of schmidt number and prandtl number from unity and the variation of reynolds analogy factor with prandtl number, blowing parameter, wall concentration, and molecular weight ratio are found to have relatively minor influence on the heat block ratio at high rates of ablation. the primary factor governing the influence of molecular weight ratio on the heat block ratio is the variation of across the boundary layer. little loss of accuracy is incurred, in the range of molecular weight ratios considered here, by assuming schmidt and prandtl numbers of unity as long as the variation is properly taken into account.
