unsteady laminar compressible boundary layers on an infinite plate with suction or injection. this study deals with unsteady compressible laminar boundary layers on an infinitely extended porous plate. an integral solution based on two types of assumed velocity and temperature profiles is presented for the general case where the unsteady free-stream velocity and rate of surface suction or injection are both arbitrary. also indicated is an exact solution, applicable, however, only to certain specific unsteady free-stream and surface suction or injection variations. the reliability and range of validity of the integral solutions is then established on the basis of numerical results from the exact solution. finally, several general qualitative conclusions of the unsteady effects of free-stream velocity and surface suction or injection on laminar boundary-layer behavior are made.
