three-dimensional effect of flutter in a real fluid. in ref. 1, an alternative semi-empirical formulation for flutter in a real fluid is given. for more accurate determination of the empirical coefficients, the three-dimensional effect of finite span should be taken into account. following reissner's approximation for large-aspect-ratio rectangular wings, the boundary-value problem governing the downwash w and the vorticity distribution.
