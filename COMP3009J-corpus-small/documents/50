investigation of laminar boundary layer in compressible fluids using the crocco method. in the present investigation of the flow of air in a thin laminar boundary layer on a flat plate, the crocco method has been used to solve the simultaneous differential equations of momentum and energy involved in such flow. the crocco method was used because it gave accurate results for arbitrary prandtl number near unity. the prandtl number was taken at 0.75, the specific heat was held constant, and the sutherland law of viscosity-temperature variation was assumed to represent the viscosity data starting with an initial ambient temperature of -67.6 f. the main results presented here are the skin-friction and heat-transfer coefficients as functions of reynolds number, mach number, and wall-to-free-stream temperature ratio. variations of shear, velocity, temperature, and mach number across the boundary layer are included. the crocco method is discussed in detail.
