a study of inviscid flow about air foils at high supersonic speeds. steady flow about curved airfoils at high supersonic speeds is investigated analyticially. with the assumption that air behaves as a diatomic gas, it is found the the shock-expansion method may be used to predict the flow about curved airfoils up to extremely high mach numbers, provided the flow deflection angles are not too close to those corresponding to shock detachment. this result applies not only to the determination of the surface pressure distribution, but also to the determination of the whole flow field about an airfoil. verification of this observation is obtained with the aid of the method of characteristics by extensive calculations of the pressure gradient and shock-wave curvature at the leading edge, and by calculations of the pressure distribution on a 10-percent-thick biconvex airfoil at 0 angle of attack. an approximation to the shock-expansion method for thin airfoils at high mach numbers is also investigated and is found to yield pressures in error by less than 10 percent at mach numbers above three and flow deflection angles up to 25. this slender-airfoil method is relatively simple in form and thus may prove useful for some engineering purposes. effects of caloric imperfections of air manifest in disturbed flow fields at high mach numbers are investigated, particular attention being given to the reduction of the ratio of specific heats. so long as this ratio does not decrease appreciably below to include the effects of these imperfections, should be substantially as accurate as for ideal-gas flows. this observation is verfied with the aid of a generalized shock-expansion method and a generalized method of characteristics employed in forms applicable for local air temperatures up to about 5000 rankine. the slender-airfoil method is modified to employ an average value of the ratio of specific heats for a particular flow field. this simplified method has essentially the same accuracy for imperfect-gas flows as its counterpart has for ideal-gas flows. an approximate flow analysis is made at extremely high mach numbers where it is indicated that the ratio of specific heats may approach close to 1. in this case, it is found that the shock-expansion method may be in considerable error,. however, the busemann method for the limit of infinite free-stream mach number and specific-heat ratio of 1 appears to apply with reasonable accuracy.
