turbulent skin friction at high mach numbers and reynolds numbers in air and helium. nasa r82, 1960. results are given of local skin-friction measurements in turbulent boundary layers over an equivalent air mach number range from 0.2 to 9.9 and an over-all reynolds number variation of 2x10 to 100x10. direct force measurements were made by means of a floating element. flows were two-dimensional over a smooth flat surface with essentially zero pressure gradient and with adiabatic conditions at the wall. air and helium were used as working fluids. an equivalence parameter for comparing boundary layers in different working fluids is derived and the experimental verification of the parameter is demonstrated. experimental results are compared with the results obtained by several methods of calculating skin friction in the turbulent boundary layer.
