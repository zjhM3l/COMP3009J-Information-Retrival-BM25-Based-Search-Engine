compressive buckling of simply supplorted plates with longitudinal stiffeners. charts are presented for the analysis of the stability under compression of simply supported rectangular plates with one, two, three, and an infinite number of identical equally spaced longitudinal stiffeners that have zero torsional stiffness.
