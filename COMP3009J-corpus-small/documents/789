a further note on the calculation of heat transfer through the axisymmetrical laminar boundary layer on a circular cylinder. by using a karman-pohlhausen method the distribution of local rate of heat transfer is ovaluated for the case of air flow in an axisymmetrical laminar boundary layer on a heated circular cylinder, the temperature of the cylinder being independent of downstream distance. this calculation serves to link the numerical values obtained by seban, bond, and kelly for small downstream distances to those obtained by bourne and davies for large downstream distances.
