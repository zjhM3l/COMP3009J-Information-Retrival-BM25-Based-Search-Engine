magnetohydrodynamic flow past a semi-infinite plate. the flow of viscous electrically conducting fluid past a semi-infinite plate is considered. the applied constant magnetic field and the constant on-coming velocity of the fluid are in the direction parallel to the plate. in addition to reynolds number the flow in the boundary layer depends on two parameters and. the two simultaneous ordinary nonlinear differential equations are solved by the asymptotic method for the cases when and respectively. the main results obtained are as follows. the equations can be solved exactly for and. the perturbation effect from infinity when k is large depends on, whereas the perturbation effect from zero when k is small depends on. for large k, including there is no solution for. it is assumed that the fluid is incompressible with constant physical properties.
