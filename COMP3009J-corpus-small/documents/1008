free-flight measurements of the static and dynamic. representative experimental results are presented to show the current status of the panel flutter problem. results are presented for unstiffened rectangular panels and for rectangular panels stiffened by corrugated backing. flutter boundaries are established for all types of panels when considered on the basis of equivalent isotropic plates. the effects of mach number, differential pressure, and aerodynamic heating on panel flutter are discussed. a flutter analysis of orthotropic panels is presented in the appendix.
