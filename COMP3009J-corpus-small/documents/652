pressure distribution on two dimensional wings near the ground. a simple method of calculating the pressure distribution in incompressible flow on two-dimensional aerofoils of arbitrary section at moderate distances from the ground is developed. comparisons with an /exact/ potential flow solution, and with measurements on a 10 thick aerofoil of rae.101 section, provide a satisfactory verification of the adequacy of the method ,. but it is shown that it is necessary to take account of the boundary layer on the aerofoil in the calculations.
