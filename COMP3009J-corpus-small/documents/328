the boundary layer near the stagnation point in hypersonic flow past a sphere. flow properties behind shock waves caused by bluff bodies traveling at supersonic speeds are of major importance in missile and high-speed aircraft design. paper presents a mathematical solution for the laminar boundary layer near the stagnation point of a sphere. surface temperature is free-stream static and shock is strong. air is assumed calorically and thermally perfect with a prandtl number of 0.72 and a dynamic viscosity directly proportional to temperature. based on work of homann (zamm 16, p. 153, 1936) and lighthill simultaneous differential equations for the velocity and temperature profiles. these are solved by numerical integration along a normal to the surface using a digital computer. results are presented as functions of free-stream mach number, reynolds number, and specific heat ratio. as increases, boundary-layer thickness is shown to decrease while shock stand-off distance increases. stand-off distance also decreases with increasing and decreasing specific heat. for constant and specific heat ratio, the product of skin-friction coefficient and the square root of decreases with increasing only approaching a constant value at greater than 10,000. reviewer's comment is concerned with the perfect gas assumption for air. author suggests that the effects of dissociation on flow properties are accounted for by a proper choice of specific heat ratio. a consideration of the kinetics of chemical reaction in the cooled boundary layer emphasizes the oversimplification of this approach. the effect on transport properties could have been approximated in present analysis by changing the prandtl number to one more representative of the existing pressures and temperatures.
