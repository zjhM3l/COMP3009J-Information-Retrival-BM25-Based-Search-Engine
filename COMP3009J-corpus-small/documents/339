experimental evaluation of heat transfer with transpiration cooling in a turbulent boundary layer at m=3.2. it is found that for prescribed velocity field, electrical field and conductivity, the current can be calculated by integration. work is related to analytic investigation of the boundary layer in a physically reasonable accelerator.
