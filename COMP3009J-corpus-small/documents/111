the laminar boundary layer equation: a method of solution by means of an automatic computer. a method, very suitable for use with an automatic computer, of solving the hartree-womersley approximation to the incompressible boundary-layer equation is developed. it is based on an iterative process and the choleski method of solving a simultaneous set of linear algebraic equations. the programming of this method for an automatic computer is discussed. tables of a solution of the boundary-layer equation in a region upstream of the separation point are given. in the upstream neighbourhood of separation this solution is compared with goldstein's asymptotic solution and the agreement is good.
