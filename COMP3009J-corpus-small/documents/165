skin-friction measurements in incompressible flow. experiments have been conducted to measure in incompressible flow the local surface-shear stress and the average skin-friction coefficient for a turbulent boundary-layer on a smooth flat plate having zero pressure gradient. the local surface-shear stress was measured by a floating-element skin-friction balance and also by a calibrated total head tube located on the surface of the test wall. the average skin-friction coefficient was obtained from boundary-layer velocity profiles. the boundary-layer profiles were also used to determine the location of the virtual origin of the turbulent boundary layer. data were obtainec for a range of reynolds numbers from 1 million to about 45 million with an attendant change in mach number from 0.11 to 0.32. the measured local skin-friction coefficients obtained with the floating-element balance agree well with those of schultz-grunow and kempf for reynolds numbers up to 45 million. the measured average skin-friction coefficients agree with those given by the schoenherr curve in the ranges of reynolds numbers from 1 to 3 million and 30 to 45 million. in the range of reynolds numbers from 3 to 30 million the measured values are less than those predicted by the schoenherr curve. the results show that the /univeral skin-friction constants/ proposed by coles appraoch asymptotically a constant value at reynolds numbers exceeding mentioned constants and the limited reynolds number range of the present investigation, there is some doubt as to the validity of any turbulent skin-friction law written on the basis of the present results. hence, no new friction law is proposed. the frictional resistance of a flat plate was calculated by means of the momentum method and also the integrated measured local surface shear. for reynolds numbers from 14 million to 45 million both methods give about the same result,. whereas at lower values of reynolds number the momentum method based on velocity profiles uncorrected for the effects of turbulence results in a frictional resistance as much as 4 percent higher than that of the integrated shear. the measurement of local surface shear by a calibrated preston tube appears to be accurate and inexpensive. the calibration as given by preston must be modified slighlty, however, to yield the results obtained from the floating-element skin-friction balance.
