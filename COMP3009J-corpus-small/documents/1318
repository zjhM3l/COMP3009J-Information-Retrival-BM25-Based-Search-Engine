stagnation temperature measurements in a hypersonic gun tunnel using the sodium-line reversal method. the sodium line reversal /s.l.r./ method has recently been used to measure transient temperatures in the 1400degreek to 3000degreek range, for example ref.6 reports measurements of gun flash temperatures. in the gun tunnel, stagnation temperatures in the above range can be generated flow between a blunt body and its bow shock wave. the gas temperature in this zone is close to the stagnation value.
