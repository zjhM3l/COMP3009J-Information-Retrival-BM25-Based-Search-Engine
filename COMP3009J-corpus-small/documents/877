the influence of aerodynamic heating on the flexural rigidity of a thin wing. this report considers the loss of flexural rigidity of a thin wing due to the presence of middle-surface stresses resulting from aerodynamic heating. the spanwise properties of the wing are assumed constant but the wing section is arbitrary. the loss of flexural rigidity is comparable with the corresponding loss of torsional rigidity.
