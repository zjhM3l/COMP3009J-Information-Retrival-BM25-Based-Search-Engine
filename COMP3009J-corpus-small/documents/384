application of second-order shock-expansion theory to several types of bodies of revolution. second-order shock-expansion theory is utilized to obtain equations for the initial normal force curve slope, initial pitching moment curve slope, and zero-lift wave drag for several type bodies of revolution. bodies considered are the cone-cylinder, cone-cylinder-frustum, cone-cylinder-frustum-booster, cone-frustum, and cone-frustum booster.
