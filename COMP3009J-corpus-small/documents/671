pressure and boundary-layer measurements on a two dimensional wing at low speed. results are given of pressure measurements and boundary-layer traverses on a two-dimensional wing with 10 per cent rae 101 section at reynolds numbers of 1.6x10 and 3.2x10. these results which have been integrated to give lift, drag and aerodynamic-centre characteristics, are used to check some calculation methods for the growth of the turbulent boundary layer and for the effect of a known boundary layer on the pressure distribution. it is concluded that the calculation of the boundary layer still needs a little refinement before it is accurate enough to predict viscosity effects on pressure distribution, lift, drag and aerodynamic center,.but that these effects can be calculated if the actual boundary-layer characteristics are known.
