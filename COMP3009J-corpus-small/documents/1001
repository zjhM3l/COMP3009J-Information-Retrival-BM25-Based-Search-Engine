wind tunnel investigation of the static and dynamic stability characteristics of a 10degree semivertex angle blunted cone. the static and dynamic stability characteristics of a blunted 10degree semivertex angle cone were studied. the cone which had a modified spherical segment nose was tested with a flat base and with a truncated conical base. all tests were performed in air at mach numbers from 0.65 to 2.20 with the angle-of-attack range from -4degree to +18degree. presented are measurements of the normal force, axial force, base pressure, and pitching moment from the static tests, and the damping-in-pitch moment from the dynamic tests. both models had satisfactory stability characteristics throughout the test mach number range but the addition of the conical afterbody had a large destabilizing effect.
