comparison of theoretical and experimental creep buckling times of initially straight, centrally loaded columns. the creep-buckling times of initially straight, centrally loaded columns as predicted by the hypotheses of shanley, gerard, and rabotnov and shesterikov are compared with appropriate experimental data. it is found that the theoretical predictions are generally conservative, due possibly to the fact that the hypotheses predict initial instability times while the experiments normally record final collapse times. of the three hypotheses, that of gerard generally gives predictions which agree best with the experimental data.
