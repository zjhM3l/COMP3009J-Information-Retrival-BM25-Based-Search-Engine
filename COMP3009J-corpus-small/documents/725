the response of a typical aircraft structure to jet noise. an analysis is made of experimentally determined mode shapes excited on the rear structure of a modern airliner by jet noise from a pod-mounted turbojet engine. power spectra of stresses determined from strain-gage measurements are obtained and cross correlated. extensive measurements were made on skin panels of the fuselage and elevator and limited ones were made on fuselage stringers and frames. the skin-panel results are compared with theoretical predictions. reviewer believes that this paper is of considerable value for those concerned with response of aircraft-type structures to jet-induced noise.
