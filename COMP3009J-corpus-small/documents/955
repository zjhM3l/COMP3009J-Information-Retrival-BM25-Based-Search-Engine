the membrane approach to bending instability of pressureized cylindrical shells. recent theoretical and experimental research is briefly described to trace the development of deformation and the occurrence of collapse in pressurized circular cylindrical membranes under applied moment loading. the collapse of pure membrane cylinders is then compared with instability of pressurized cylindrical shells. this approach leads to a better understanding of the behavior of pressurized cylinders under bending loads. the results suggest possibilities for further research utilizing the membrane approach.
