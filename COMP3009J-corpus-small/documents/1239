body under lifting wing. an investigation is made of supersonic-aircraft configurations composed of a cambered body positioned a certain distance beneath an arbitrary lifting wing. the geometry of the wing is regarded as given and the geometry of the body may be given or optimum. expressions for the drag and lift are obtained from reverse-flow considerations,. these greatly implement such a study when interference cross flows must be cancelled. the drag advantage to be gained when a given body and wing assume a given orientation is studied. treated more extensively is the variational problem of determining the optimum wing incidence and optimum body shape, for the given volume and length, to yield the minimum drag for prescribed lift. numerical results are provided to indicate the significance of the large number of parameters appearing in the problem. of these, the gap between the wing and the body is found to be particularly important. it is found that at low gap moderate body distortions have a significant influence on the drag. drag reductions of up to 44 relative to the case of no interference have been found at a mach number of 2.24 in a configuration having a gap approximately equal to the maximum diameter of the body, and a wing chord of about three eighths of the length of the body. comparison is made with the conventional wing-body combination including the effects of skin friction, and it is concluded that the advantage suggested by the preceding considerations is not appreciably diminished. finally, it is shown that the configurations studied lead to bodies of fineness ratios much lower than are appropriate to conventional wing-body combinations. tests were made on an arrangement consisting of a scars-haack body located under a lifting rectangular diamond-profile wing. the mach number was 1.6 and the reynolds number was 9.17 x 10 based on the body length. it was found that the measured lift developed on the wing due to the flow field of the body agrees very well with the theoretical value. downstream of the impinging shock from the wing, flow separation was observed on the exterior of the body but not in the interior. the separation is attributed not to the pressure rise across the shock but to the pressure field arising from the reflection from the body of the shock-induced cross flow. further observations suggest that the separation can be avoided by pitching the body or by kinking the body at the shock wave to accommodate the shock-induced cross flow.
