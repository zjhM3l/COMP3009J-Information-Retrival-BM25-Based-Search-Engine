handbook of structural stability. pt.vi. strength of stiffened curved plates and shells. a comprehensive review of failure of stiffened curved plates and shells is presented. panel instability in stiffened curved plates and general instability of stiffened cylinders are discussed. the loadings considered for the plates are axial, shear, and the combination of the two. for the cylinders, bending, external pressure, torsion, transverse shear, and combinations of these loads are considered. general instability in stiffened cylinders was investigated. for bending and torsion loads, test data and theory were correlated. for external pressure several existing theories were compared. as a result of this investigation a unified theoretical approach to analysis of general instability in stiffened cylinders was developed.
