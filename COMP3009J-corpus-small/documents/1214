the drag of elongated bodies over a wide reynolds number range. the resistance of bodies in motion through an incompressible viscous fluid is predictable from stokes- or oseen-type solutions in the creeping-motion range, while some test information is available in the boundary-layer range. with the exception of experimental results for spheres or circular cylinders and analytical and experimental results for flat plates, almost no information is available on other bodies, particularly in the intermediate range of reynolds numbers extending from unity to a million. experimental results as obtained from hydroballistic studies in water and glycerin-water solutions are presented for finned ellipsoids of fineness-ratio.4 over a 20,000-fold range and are correlated with available information on other bodies. although results do not extend down to the creeping-motion region where analytical predictions are available, comparison with the drag coefficient trends for spheres and flat plates indicates that an appropriate curve for the ellipsoid could be extended so as to cover the entire laminar-viscous range. less extensive results are presented on the drag of fineness-ratio 8 ellipsoids and on laminar-turbulent transition occurrences.
