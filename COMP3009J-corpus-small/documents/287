some theoretical low-speed loading characteristics of swept wings in roll and sideslip. the weissinger method for determining additional span loading for incompressible flow is used to find the damping in roll, the lateral center of pressure of the rolling load, and the span loading coefficients caused by rolling for wing plan forms of various aspect ratios, taper ratios, and sweep angles. in addition, the applicability of the method to the determination of certain other aerodynamic derivatives is investigated, and corrections for the first-order effects of compressibility are indicated. the agreement obtained between experimentally and theoretically determined values for the aerodynamic coefficients indicates that the method of weissinger is well suited to the calculation of the additional span loading caused by rolling and for the calculation of such resulting aerodynamic derivatives of wings as do not involve considerations of tip suction.
