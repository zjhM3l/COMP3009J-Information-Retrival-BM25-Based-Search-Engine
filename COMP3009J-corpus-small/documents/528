first-order slip effects on the laminar boundary layer over a slender body of revolution with zero pressure gradient. in reference 1, the analysis given by probstein and elliott for the zero-pressure-gradient, constant-wall-temperature, compressible, laminar boundary layer with transverse curvature was extended to first-order slip flow. this extension was based on a double asymptotic expansion in a transverse-curvature parameter and a slip parameter. the expansion in ref. 1, however, was carried out with the parameter held constant. for and a constant wall temperature, is constant and e varies with x due to the dependence of the local body radius on x. thus, for arbitrary body shapes, e will not be constant. in the present note, the analysis of ref. 1 is re-examined taking into account the variation of e.
