analytical study of the tumbling motions of vehicles entering planetary atmospheres. the tumbling motion of vehicles entering planetary atmospheres is analyzed. a differential equation governing the tumbling motion, its arrest, and the subsequent oscillatory motion is obtained and identified as the equation for the fifth painleve transcendant. an approximate analytical solution for the transcendant is derived. comparisons with results obtained from numerical integration of the exact equations of motion indicate that the solution for the angle-of-attack history is sufficiently accurate to be of practical use.
