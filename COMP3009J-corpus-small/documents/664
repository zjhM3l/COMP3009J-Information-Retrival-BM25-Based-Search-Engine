the boundary layer on a flat plate in a stream with uniform shear. the incompressible laminar boundary layer on a semi-infinite flat plate is considered, when the main stream has uniform shear. a solution is obtained for the first two terms of an asymptotic solution for small viscosity. it is shown that one of the principal effects of free-stream vorticity is to introduce a modified pressure field outside the boundary-layer region.
