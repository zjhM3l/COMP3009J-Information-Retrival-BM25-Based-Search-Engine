boundary layer displacement effects in air at mach numbers of 6. 8 and 9. 6. measurements are presented for pressure gradients induced by a laminar boundary layer on a flat plate in air at a mach number of 9.6 and for the drag of thin wings at a mach number of about 6.8 and zero angle of attack. the pressure measurements at a mach number of 9.6 were made in the presence of substantial heat transfer from the boundary layer to the plate surface. the measured pressure distribution on the surface of the plate was predicted with good accuracy by a modification to insulated-plate displacement theory which allows for the effect of the heat transfer and temperature gradient along the surface on the boundary-layer displacement thickness. the total drag of thin wings with square and delta plan forms was measured at a nominal mach number of 6.8 over a reasonably wide range of reynolds numbers. the total drag was found to be greater than can be explained by adding a classical value of laminar skin friction to the estimated pressure drag. the difference is, in general, explained by the increase in skin friction (20 to 40 percent) caused by the boundary-layer-induced pressures.
