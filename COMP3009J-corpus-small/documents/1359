compression tests on circular cylinders stiffened longitudinally by closely spaced z-section stringers. six circular cylinders stiffened longitudinally by closely spaced z-section stringers were loaded to failure in compression. the results obtained are presented and compared with available theoretical results for the buckling of orthotropic cylinders. the results indicate that the large disparity that exists between theory and experiment for unstiffened compression cylinders may be significantly smaller for stiffened cylinders.
