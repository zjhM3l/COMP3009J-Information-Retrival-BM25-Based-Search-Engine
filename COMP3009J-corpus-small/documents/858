experimental investigation at mach numbers 3. 0 of the effects of thermal stress and buckling on the flutter of four-bay aluminium alloy panels with length-width ratios of 10. skin-stiffener aluminum alloy panels consisting of four bays, each bay having a length-width ratio of 10, were tested at a mach number of 3.0 at dynamic pressures ranging from 1,500 psf to 5,000 psf and at stagnation temperatures from 300 f to 655 f. the panels were restrained by the supporting structure in such a manner that partial thermal expansion of the skins could occur in both the longitudinal and lateral directions. a boundary faired through the experimental flutter points consisted of a flat-panel portion, a buckled-panel portion, and a transition point at the intersection of the two boundaries. in the region where a panel must be flat when flutter occurs, an increase in panel skin temperature (or midplane compressive stress) makes the panel more susceptible to flutter. in the region where a panel must be buckled when flutter occurs, the flutter trend is reversed. this reversal in trend is attributed to the panel postbuckling behavior.
