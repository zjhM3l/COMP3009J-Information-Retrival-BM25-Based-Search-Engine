the applications of the polygon method to the calculation of the compressible subsonic flow round two-dimensional profiles. this paper sets out the method now used by the author of applying the polygon method to the calculation of the compressible subsonic flow round two-dimensional aerofoils. tables have been constructed which can be used for all aerofoil shapes, putting the polygon method on the same footing numerically as goldstein's method has the advantage over approximation 3 that it can be applied in the following cases which are beyond the scope of goldstein's method.. conventional aerofoils, (b) the low-speed flow about very thick aerofoils, e.g., in reference 3 it is applied to circular cylinders, (c) the flow about symmetric aerofoils between either straight or constant pressure walls, (d) flow in asymmetric channels, and (e) more difficult problems of the flow about aerofoils in the presence of one or two constraining walls (to be published). a method of calculating lift and moment coefficients, and their rates of change with incidence (a) is also given in the paper. as an example the velocity distribution and the rates of change of the lift and moment coefficients with a are calculated for the aerofoil r.a.e.104 at values of m (mach number at infinity) of 0, and 0.7, for various values of the incidence, a. the velocity distributions for zero incidence are found to be in fair agreement with the corresponding experimental results. the results at incidence are in satisfactory agreement with the experimental results, not for the same incidence, but for the same lift coefficient. it is found, for example, that at m = 0.7 the theory for a = 0.8 agrees best with experiment for a = 1.0, when the lift coefficients are approximately the same.
