numerical methods for transient heat flow. this paper deals with the application of numerical methods for the solution of heat-conduction problems, their generality being extended in the following ways.. may proceed most rapidly to a solution, or may proceed more slowly and with greater precision,. (b) criteria are developed for the choice of modulus to insure convergence. this is most important at a convective surface,. (c) a method is developed for handling k and c when these properties vary independently with temperature. a comprehensive appendix gives the derivations, and the use of equations and charts is demonstrated by typical examples.
