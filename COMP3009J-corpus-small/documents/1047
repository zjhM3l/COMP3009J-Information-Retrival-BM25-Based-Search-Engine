the bending strength of pressurized cylinders. be described here is attributed to the russian investigator v. g. galerkin, whose original papers are inaccessible to the present writer. his knowledge of the method is derived from a description given in a paper by e. p. grossman. grossman states that the method was given by galerkin in his treatise p. 897), and that applications to oscillation problems were first made by v. p. lyskov. it is pointed out by grossman that galerkin's process in applications to mechanics leads to the same results as lagrange's principle of virtual work, but employs a special co-ordinate system. the method of galerkin belongs to the same general class as those of rayleigh and ritz, for it seeks to obtain an approximate solution of a differential equation with given boundary conditions by taking a function which satisfies these conditions exactly, and proceeds to specialise the function in such a manner as to secure approximate satisfaction of the differential equation. the selected function is a linear combination of n independent functions, and the coefficients are determined by a process of integration. the galerkin process can be considered from two points of view, (a) simply as a means for the approximate solution of differential equations, and treatment of problems concerning the statics and dynamics of elastic and other deformable bodies. these two aspects are treated separately in parts 1 and 2 of the paper respectively, and will now be briefly discussed. which satisfies the boundary conditions, in the differential equation be. since the result should be zero, is the error in the differential equation. then the galerkin process consists in choosing the n coefficients in the function in such a manner that n distinct weighted means of the error, taken throughout a certain range of representation, shall all be zero. as a generalised force, and the multipliers used to weight the errors are the virtual displacements corresponding to increments of each of the generalised co-ordinates in turn. thus the vanishing of the weighted mean is here interpreted as the vanishing of the virtual work in the appropriate displacement. the degree of accuracy attaindd can be increased indefinitely by increasing the number of independent functions employed, but this entails a great increase of labour. however, when the functions are well chosen, an excellent approximation can be obtained by the use of a very small number, as is sufficiently shown by the examples included in this paper.
