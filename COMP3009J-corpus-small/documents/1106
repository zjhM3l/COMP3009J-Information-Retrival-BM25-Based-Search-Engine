free-flight observation of a separated turbulent flow including heat transfer up to mach 8. 5. a turbulent boundary layer separated by a forward-facing step was observed on the cylindrical portion of a hemisphere-cone-cylinder test vehicle. tip blunting, producing a shear flow, was found to induce higher pressures on the cylindrical portion than were predicted from ballistic tunnel data of unblunted projectiles. an approximate method for predicting this blunt-body pressure distribution was hypothesized. these findings, along with the hypothesis, were substantiated by a wind tunnel test of a similar body. the peak pressure ratios of the separation were smaller in magnitude than flat plate theory predicted because of the effect of the shear flow. the decrement in heating of the separated flow, relative to the corresponding attached flow, was found to compare well with the expected results.
